in the rice fields,

well-dusted, as you can see.

Mei, your hands are filthy.
What on earth did you do?

191
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:18,775
I caught a soot gremlin, but he got away.

You've got soot sprites in your house.

About this big?

198

They scurry everywhere
when you enter a room?

That's right.

200
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:49,180
They live in old, empty houses

201
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:53,976
and run all over the place,
covering everything with dirt.

202
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:57,647
I used to be able to see them
when I was your age.

203

So you've seen them, too.
That's very interesting.

204
00:15:01,484 --> 00:15:03,903
So they're a kind of ghost, then?

205

Don't worry, dear.
They're nothing to be afraid of.

206
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:11,160
If they decide you're nice people,
they won't harm you,

207
00:15:11,369 --> 00:15:13,704
and after a while, they'll just go away.

leaving the hospital, is she?

- She goes back on Monday.

I'll call you right back. Okay?

- Yeah.
- Just wait by the phone.

01:13:25,484 --> 01:13:27,862
- Oh! Are you crazy?
- I'm looking for my little sister.

900
01:13:27,987 --> 01:13:30,698
Have you seen a girl walking this way?

901
01:13:30,865 --> 01:13:31,824
Is she lost?

902
01:13:31,991 --> 01:13:35,912
I think she's trying to walk to the
hospital. She's only four years old.

903
01:13:36,078 --> 01:13:38,539
Oh. I didn't see her. Did you?

904
01:13:38,706 --> 01:13:40,833
No. We just came from the hospital,

905
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:44,462
and there was no sign of
a little girl on the road.

906
01:13:44,629 --> 01:13:46,923
Okay. Thanks.

907
01:13:47,089 --> 01:13:49,634
- Wait. Where'd you say you're from?
- From Matsugo.

908
01:13:49,842 --> 01:13:51,218
Matsugo! Ho!

909
01:13:51,427 --> 01:13:54,347

- No.

- I guess you didn't, either.
- Mmm-mmm.

916
01:14:17,244 --> 01:14:19,580
My dad's got a bunch of
people looking for her.

917
01:14:19,705 --> 01:14:22,041
I could ride my bike
to the hospital for you.

918

- You should go back home.
- Check all around.

919
01:14:24,585 --> 01:14:27,797
I'm sure that Mei got lost
on her way to the hospital, okay?

920
01:14:27,964 --> 01:14:30,758
A little while ago,
they found a sandal in the pond.
