1
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:33,904
Dad, do you want a caramel?

2
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:36,865
Thanks. Aren't you tired?

3
00:02:37,072 --> 00:02:37,584
All right.

4
00:02:37,912 --> 00:02:38,981
We're almost there.

5
00:02:50,472 --> 00:02:51,382
Mei, hide!

6
00:02:57,632 --> 00:02:59,190
It wasn't a policeman.

7
00:03:32,152 --> 00:03:34,871
Hello. Are your parents around?

8
00:03:36,992 --> 00:03:38,311
Thanks.

9
00:03:40,312 --> 00:03:44,351
I'm Kusakabe! We've just arrived!

10
00:03:45,152 --> 00:03:47,302
A pleasure to meet you!

11
00:03:47,472 --> 00:03:49,110
Welcome!

12
00:03:54,232 --> 00:03:55,904
Thank you.

13
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:18,462
Here we are!

14
00:04:19,872 --> 00:04:21,703
Wait!

15
00:04:24,712 --> 00:04:26,065
Mei, there's a bridge!

16
00:04:26,312 --> 00:04:27,267
A bridge?

17
00:04:32,392 --> 00:04:34,781
See that flash? Fish too!

18
00:04:35,632 --> 00:04:37,384
So, you like it here?

19
00:04:40,032 --> 00:04:42,182
Dad, it's terrific!

20
00:04:42,352 --> 00:04:43,990
Look, a tunnel of trees!

21
00:04:46,232 --> 00:04:48,587
Is that our house?

22
00:04:52,712 --> 00:04:54,430
Come on!

23
00:05:07,352 --> 00:05:09,183
It's a wreck!

24
00:05:09,352 --> 00:05:10,751
Wreck!

25
00:05:10,992 --> 00:05:12,345
Looks like a haunted house!

26
00:05:12,512 --> 00:05:13,342
Haunted?

27
00:05:21,272 --> 00:05:22,341
And it's all rotten!

28
00:05:34,192 --> 00:05:35,671
It's gonna fall down!

29
00:05:35,832 --> 00:05:37,504
Fall down!

30
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:49,303
Look, Mei!

31
00:05:51,672 --> 00:05:52,900
See?

32
00:06:02,192 --> 00:06:03,784
It's huge.

33
00:06:09,312 --> 00:06:11,906
Dad, there's a huge tree!

34
00:06:12,632 --> 00:06:14,350
It's a camphor tree.

35
00:06:16,472 --> 00:06:18,428
Camphor tree…

36
00:06:27,712 --> 00:06:28,622
Oops!

37
00:06:31,512 --> 00:06:32,308
An acorn!

38
00:06:34,072 --> 00:06:35,744
Show me.

39
00:06:37,472 --> 00:06:38,791
Another one!

40
00:06:43,952 --> 00:06:46,420
One for me!

41
00:06:52,432 --> 00:06:54,900
Out of the way. I can't open the screens.

42
00:06:55,552 --> 00:06:56,507
Acorns!

43
00:06:56,712 --> 00:06:59,067
There's acorns in the house.

44
00:06:59,232 --> 00:07:00,631
They dropped from up there!

45
00:07:05,352 --> 00:07:08,264
Maybe there are squirrels in here.

46
00:07:08,512 --> 00:07:10,184
Squirrels, really?

47
00:07:10,832 --> 00:07:13,062
Or rats that like acorns.

48
00:07:14,152 --> 00:07:15,631
I'd rather have squirrels!

49
00:07:16,312 --> 00:07:18,268
Where shall I put this?

50
00:07:18,872 --> 00:07:23,468
Here, I'll get the door for you. Satsuki, open up the kitchen.

51
00:07:24,112 --> 00:07:25,511
It's just round the back.

52
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:29,266
Mei, come on!

53
00:07:30,672 --> 00:07:32,264
Wait for me!

54
00:07:33,632 --> 00:07:35,384
Hurry!

55
00:08:13,512 --> 00:08:14,581
Ready?

56
00:08:26,992 --> 00:08:28,266
Bathtubs.

57
00:08:34,312 --> 00:08:35,711
There's nothing here.

58
00:08:37,712 --> 00:08:38,906
That's the bathroom.

59
00:08:39,152 --> 00:08:40,824
Dad, there's something in here.

60
00:08:41,032 --> 00:08:41,748
A squirrel?

61
00:08:41,992 --> 00:08:46,622
Dunno. A bunch of black things but not roaches or mice.

62
00:08:46,872 --> 00:08:48,624
Really?

63
00:09:00,192 --> 00:09:01,261
Can you see 'em?

64
00:09:02,712 --> 00:09:04,430
I think they were… soot gremlins.

65
00:09:04,712 --> 00:09:07,465
'Gremlins'? Like in my picture book?

66
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:10,903
That's right. Ghosts don't come out on days like this.

67
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:18,622
When you walk into a dark room from outside,

68
00:09:19,312 --> 00:09:21,746
your eyes dim and so the dustbunnies come out.

69
00:09:22,272 --> 00:09:23,466
Oh, I see.

70
00:09:23,952 --> 00:09:30,630
Come here, soot gremlins. Come out, come out, wherever you are!

71
00:09:36,072 --> 00:09:40,463
Let's get to work! See if you can find how to get upstairs.

72
00:09:42,352 --> 00:09:44,946
Get up there and open all the windows.

73
00:09:45,552 --> 00:09:46,428
Sure!

74
00:09:46,672 --> 00:09:47,946
I'm coming, too!

75
00:09:56,672 --> 00:09:58,151
Toilet!

76
00:10:00,632 --> 00:10:01,747
Not here!

77
00:10:19,312 --> 00:10:20,301
Nothing here!

78
00:10:20,952 --> 00:10:22,431
Nothing!

79
00:10:32,352 --> 00:10:34,422
Mei, it's here!

80
00:10:40,992 --> 00:10:42,584
It's pitch black!

81
00:10:42,752 --> 00:10:44,424
Soot gremlins…

82
00:10:52,832 --> 00:10:53,981
Another acorn.

83
00:11:00,392 --> 00:11:04,067
Come out, soot gremlins!

84
00:11:43,712 --> 00:11:47,227
Are you there, Mr. Soot Gremlin?

85
00:12:12,792 --> 00:12:16,785
Dad, there's definitely something here!

86
00:12:16,952 --> 00:12:22,948
That's exciting! I've always wanted to live in a haunted house.

87
00:12:25,992 --> 00:12:27,311
I'm coming!

88
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,942
I got it. Satsuki!

89
00:13:28,752 --> 00:13:29,707
Mei.

90
00:13:40,352 --> 00:13:42,183
You're full of energy!

91
00:13:42,592 --> 00:13:46,904
This is 'Nanny'. She looks after the house and came to help.

92
00:13:47,832 --> 00:13:50,824
I'm Satsuki and this is my sister, Mei.

93
00:13:51,112 --> 00:13:53,865
Nice to meet you both.

94
00:13:54,032 --> 00:14:00,426
I'd have cleaned up if I'd known you'd be this quick.

95
00:14:01,032 --> 00:14:02,863
No, you've done plenty.

96
00:14:03,032 --> 00:14:08,311
Lately I've been so busy in the rice paddies, I only did a bit of dusting…

97
00:14:09,752 --> 00:14:12,425
What have you done to your hands?

98
00:14:12,632 --> 00:14:14,702
The soot gremlin got away…

99
00:14:14,872 --> 00:14:16,988
Your feet, too!

100
00:14:20,992 --> 00:14:22,869
Mine are black, too!

101
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:34,142
That must be the ‘soot sprites'.

102
00:14:34,512 --> 00:14:40,621
Those little, black, fuzzy things that fly?

103
00:14:40,832 --> 00:14:45,303
That's right. They breed in empty old houses,

104
00:14:45,512 --> 00:14:49,027
and cover them with soot and dust.

105
00:14:50,312 --> 00:14:57,627
I could see them when I was little. Now you can too, huh?

106
00:14:57,832 --> 00:14:59,311
Are they like goblins or something?

107
00:14:59,912 --> 00:15:03,905
Naah, nothing so scary.

108
00:15:04,112 --> 00:15:09,266
If you keep smiling, they'll soon leave the house.

109
00:15:11,032 --> 00:15:15,071
They're probably deciding where to go next, right now.

110
00:15:21,112 --> 00:15:22,864
Mei, they're going away.

111
00:15:23,032 --> 00:15:23,862
That's no fun.

112
00:15:24,072 --> 00:15:26,461
What happens if a huge one comes out, like this?

113
00:15:27,072 --> 00:15:28,061
I wouldn't be scared.

114
00:15:28,552 --> 00:15:32,147
Okay then, I won't walk you to the bathroom at night.

115
00:15:34,592 --> 00:15:39,541
Okay, cleaning time. Could you get some water from the stream?

116
00:15:39,712 --> 00:15:40,747
From the stream?

117
00:15:40,992 --> 00:15:42,027
I'm coming, too!

118
00:15:45,792 --> 00:15:47,350
Mei, wait there.

119
00:15:56,872 --> 00:15:58,783
Did you get a fish?

120
00:16:10,432 --> 00:16:12,263
Nanny, it's coming out!

121
00:16:12,872 --> 00:16:17,263
Good, keep pumping 'til the water gets cold.

122
00:16:17,752 --> 00:16:18,980
Okay!

123
00:17:01,192 --> 00:17:04,070
May I help you?

124
00:17:05,432 --> 00:17:08,071
Huh… my Mom… for Granny.

125
00:17:10,192 --> 00:17:11,102
Yes?

126
00:17:17,352 --> 00:17:19,070
Wait, what is it?

127
00:17:20,112 --> 00:17:21,784
Is that you, Kanta?

128
00:17:23,512 --> 00:17:28,825
You live in a haunted house!

129
00:17:29,112 --> 00:17:30,147
Kanta, stop it!

130
00:17:40,672 --> 00:17:43,232
I did the same when I was his age.

131
00:17:43,832 --> 00:17:48,826
I hate boys. But I really love Nanny's rice cakes!

132
00:17:49,272 --> 00:17:51,228
Eat as much as you want.

133
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:53,386
Thank you!

134
00:17:56,432 --> 00:17:58,184
Thank you very much for your help.

135
00:17:59,672 --> 00:18:01,822
Good bye!

136
00:19:16,392 --> 00:19:19,384
Dad, the house is going to fall down.

137
00:19:21,752 --> 00:19:24,585
I hope not; we've only just moved in.

138
00:19:59,752 --> 00:20:03,062
Come on, let's laugh to keep the bogeymen away!

139
00:20:05,352 --> 00:20:06,990
I'm not scared.

140
00:20:08,232 --> 00:20:09,904
I mean it. I'm not scared!

141
00:20:54,112 --> 00:20:56,068
One-two, one-two…

142
00:20:57,192 --> 00:21:00,707
Come on, keep up the good work…

143
00:21:06,192 --> 00:21:08,945
Okay! Washing… finished!

144
00:21:18,312 --> 00:21:20,382
Here we go!

145
00:21:37,392 --> 00:21:39,906
Nanny!

146
00:21:40,432 --> 00:21:42,343
Hello!

147
00:21:42,552 --> 00:21:44,190
Hard at work?

148
00:21:44,552 --> 00:21:46,747
Where're you all heading?

149
00:21:47,512 --> 00:21:50,106
To visit Mommy in the hospital!

150
00:21:50,352 --> 00:21:54,982
That's nice. Give her my regards!

151
00:22:13,352 --> 00:22:15,183
This way.

152
00:22:42,232 --> 00:22:43,028
Hello.

153
00:22:43,392 --> 00:22:44,745
Hello there.

154
00:22:46,512 --> 00:22:47,308
Mommy!

155
00:22:47,472 --> 00:22:49,906
So glad you came, my dear.

156
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:52,307
Daddy took the wrong road.

157
00:22:52,472 --> 00:22:55,225
Really? Hello, Satsuki.

158
00:22:55,472 --> 00:22:57,064
It's a school holiday today.

159
00:22:57,272 --> 00:22:58,421
How nice.

160
00:22:58,632 --> 00:23:01,351
Daddy is talking to the doctor.

161
00:23:01,592 --> 00:23:03,423
It's so good to see you all.

162
00:23:03,832 --> 00:23:06,392
Have you settled into the new house?

163
00:23:12,592 --> 00:23:14,310
A haunted house?

164
00:23:14,752 --> 00:23:16,947
Mom, do you like ghosts?

165
00:23:17,312 --> 00:23:20,349
Of course I do! I can't wait to see them.

166
00:23:20,592 --> 00:23:22,150
See, I told you Mei.

167
00:23:23,272 --> 00:23:26,628
Mei was worried that you wouldn't like ghosts.

168
00:23:26,832 --> 00:23:27,981
What about you two?

169
00:23:28,192 --> 00:23:28,988
I love them!

170
00:23:29,232 --> 00:23:30,984
I'm not scared of them!

171
00:23:33,432 --> 00:23:36,071
Are you fixing Mei's hair, Satsuki?

172
00:23:37,232 --> 00:23:39,587
It's really good. Lucky girl, Mei.

173
00:23:41,072 --> 00:23:43,267
But she always gets mad at me.

174
00:23:43,472 --> 00:23:45,030
That's 'cuz you won't stay still.

175
00:23:45,192 --> 00:23:47,148
Come here, Satsuki.

176
00:23:47,792 --> 00:23:49,464
Isn't yours too short?

177
00:23:49,672 --> 00:23:50,787
No, I like it like this.

178
00:23:50,992 --> 00:23:52,823
Do mine, Mommy! Mine, too!

179
00:23:53,032 --> 00:23:53,828
Wait your turn!

180
00:23:54,552 --> 00:23:59,421
Wavy hair, just like mine when I was your age.

181
00:23:59,632 --> 00:24:03,466
Will it be like yours when I grow up?

182
00:24:03,832 --> 00:24:07,381
Probably. You take after your Mom.

183
00:24:25,352 --> 00:24:27,183
Mom looked really well.

184
00:24:27,432 --> 00:24:31,186
You're right.The doctor says she'll be home soon.

185
00:24:31,792 --> 00:24:33,510
Soon? Like tomorrow?

186
00:24:33,752 --> 00:24:35,708
You always say this.

187
00:24:35,952 --> 00:24:37,510
Tomorrow is a little too soon.

188
00:24:38,512 --> 00:24:41,424
Mom said she'll sleep with me in my bed.

189
00:24:41,592 --> 00:24:45,631
Weren't you saying you're big enough to sleep alone?

190
00:24:45,912 --> 00:24:48,028
Mom is special!

191
00:25:09,512 --> 00:25:12,982
Dad, time to get up!

192
00:25:16,832 --> 00:25:19,266
Wake up!

193
00:25:24,592 --> 00:25:26,310
Sorry, I overslept again…

194
00:25:26,512 --> 00:25:28,343
I've got to bring a box lunch today.

195
00:25:28,592 --> 00:25:30,503
I totally forgot about it.

196
00:25:31,272 --> 00:25:33,547
It's all right. I've made something for all of us.

197
00:25:33,792 --> 00:25:34,508
It's burning!

198
00:25:34,752 --> 00:25:35,707
I'm coming.

199
00:25:38,712 --> 00:25:40,668
Here, this is yours, Mei.

200
00:25:41,512 --> 00:25:42,661
It's for me?

201
00:25:43,672 --> 00:25:45,105
Mei, sit down and eat!

202
00:25:47,672 --> 00:25:49,424
Here, wrap yours.

203
00:25:52,752 --> 00:25:55,346
Satsuki!

204
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:56,667
Uh-oh.

205
00:25:56,872 --> 00:25:59,625
I'm coming!

206
00:26:01,272 --> 00:26:02,785
You made a friend already?

207
00:26:03,032 --> 00:26:05,023
She's calling you!

208
00:26:05,512 --> 00:26:07,104
Yup, that's Michiko.

209
00:26:09,552 --> 00:26:10,951
Gotta go!

210
00:26:12,592 --> 00:26:14,025
See ya!

211
00:26:14,472 --> 00:26:16,428
See you later!

212
00:26:17,672 --> 00:26:18,627
Morning!

213
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:21,022
Hi, let's go.

214
00:26:33,552 --> 00:26:34,951
Daddy!

215
00:26:36,112 --> 00:26:37,625
Do I look all grown up?

216
00:26:37,832 --> 00:26:40,027
Yes dear. And where might you be going?

217
00:26:40,272 --> 00:26:41,944
I'm just going out.

218
00:27:04,432 --> 00:27:06,548
Daddy, is it lunch yet?

219
00:27:06,752 --> 00:27:08,708
Already?

220
00:27:20,872 --> 00:27:23,591
You be the flower shop, Daddy.

221
00:27:39,712 --> 00:27:41,111
Pole-tads!

222
00:27:59,632 --> 00:28:02,271
Got no bottom.

223
00:28:15,712 --> 00:28:16,701
Gotcha!

224
00:33:53,552 --> 00:33:56,510
Who are you? A big soot gremlin?

225
00:34:24,632 --> 00:34:27,704
To-to-ro? You're Totoro!

226
00:34:32,992 --> 00:34:35,062
I bet you're Totoro.

227
00:35:47,232 --> 00:35:47,709
See you!

228
00:35:47,952 --> 00:35:49,101
Okay, catch you later!

229
00:35:51,432 --> 00:35:52,228
I'm home!

230
00:35:52,392 --> 00:35:55,111
Hey there. Is it that late already?

231
00:35:55,272 --> 00:35:57,183
Where's Mei? I'm off to Michiko's.

232
00:35:57,352 --> 00:36:00,742
We haven't eaten yet. Is Mei in the garden?

233
00:36:03,112 --> 00:36:04,545
Mei!

234
00:36:17,952 --> 00:36:21,786
Dad, I found her hat!

235
00:36:45,992 --> 00:36:48,301
Wake up, Mei!

236
00:36:50,032 --> 00:36:52,227
You shouldn't sleep here!

237
00:36:54,192 --> 00:36:55,181
Where's Totoro?

238
00:36:55,392 --> 00:36:56,461
Totoro?

239
00:36:56,712 --> 00:36:59,306
Where?

240
00:37:01,632 --> 00:37:03,350
Were you dreaming?

241
00:37:03,512 --> 00:37:04,991
Totoro was here.

242
00:37:05,272 --> 00:37:08,264
You mean that troll in your picture book?

243
00:37:08,512 --> 00:37:15,463
Yeah. He was all hairy with a big mouth like this.

244
00:37:15,672 --> 00:37:22,271
There's a tiny one and a little one and a huge one like this.

245
00:37:26,352 --> 00:37:29,583
There you are. Wow, this is amazing.

246
00:37:30,432 --> 00:37:31,785
A great hiding place!

247
00:37:32,072 --> 00:37:35,303
Dad, Mei said she met a Totoro here.

248
00:37:35,512 --> 00:37:36,501
A Totoro?

249
00:37:37,352 --> 00:37:38,182
It's this way.

250
00:37:46,712 --> 00:37:48,350
Hey, wait for me!

251
00:37:50,392 --> 00:37:51,711
Huh?!

252
00:37:54,072 --> 00:37:55,027
Here?

253
00:37:55,232 --> 00:37:56,267
No.

254
00:37:56,872 --> 00:37:59,227
It went to a big tree.

255
00:37:59,392 --> 00:38:01,428
But there wasn't any other path.

256
00:38:02,072 --> 00:38:04,506
Mei! Come back!

257
00:38:19,432 --> 00:38:23,391
But it's true! Totoro was here.

258
00:38:23,872 --> 00:38:25,100
I'm not lying.

259
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:35,461
I know, Mei.

260
00:38:36,232 --> 00:38:37,665
I didn't lie.

261
00:38:37,872 --> 00:38:43,105
Neither of us think you're lying.

262
00:38:43,552 --> 00:38:49,104
You probably met the king of this forest. You were very lucky.

263
00:38:49,832 --> 00:38:52,710
He doesn't come out very often.

264
00:38:54,352 --> 00:38:56,422
We should pay our respects at the shrine.

265
00:38:56,632 --> 00:38:57,462
Pay our respects?

266
00:38:57,672 --> 00:38:59,390
To this forest.

267
00:39:15,912 --> 00:39:18,790
Mei, you're getting heavy.

268
00:39:19,032 --> 00:39:20,590
Daddy, look! That camphor tree!

269
00:39:21,912 --> 00:39:23,027
What a big tree.

270
00:39:31,432 --> 00:39:32,148
It's here!

271
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:34,701
Is that the tree?

272
00:39:35,712 --> 00:39:38,180
Dad, hurry up.

273
00:39:49,032 --> 00:39:50,988
The hole has gone.

274
00:39:51,192 --> 00:39:52,386
Are you sure it was here?

275
00:39:54,272 --> 00:39:56,103
The hole disappeared.

276
00:39:56,272 --> 00:39:58,547
I told you he doesn't come to see us often.

277
00:39:58,952 --> 00:40:01,466
But will he come again? I want to meet him, too.

278
00:40:02,472 --> 00:40:05,145
If you're lucky, sure.

279
00:40:06,472 --> 00:40:08,064
What a beautiful tree.

280
00:40:09,712 --> 00:40:14,103
This tree must have stood here for years and years.

281
00:40:15,592 --> 00:40:19,471
Trees and people used to be good friends.

282
00:40:20,632 --> 00:40:27,390
I saw that tree and fell in love with the house. Hope Mom likes it, too.

283
00:40:27,552 --> 00:40:30,703
Okay, let's pay our respects then get home for lunch.

284
00:40:30,912 --> 00:40:33,380
Yes, I promised to go see Michiko.

285
00:40:33,552 --> 00:40:34,951
I want to go, too!

286
00:40:35,432 --> 00:40:36,467
Attention!

287
00:40:36,952 --> 00:40:41,309
Thank you for looking after Mei.

288
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:43,622
Please take care of us.

289
00:40:44,472 --> 00:40:45,427
Let's race home!

290
00:40:48,472 --> 00:40:50,269
Wait!

291
00:40:51,552 --> 00:40:53,429
Hurry up!

292
00:40:53,632 --> 00:40:55,668
Wait for me!

293
00:40:57,912 --> 00:41:00,665
Dear Mother, something amazing happened today.

294
00:41:01,272 --> 00:41:04,503
Mei met a giant Totoro.

295
00:41:09,512 --> 00:41:14,028
And I'm hoping to see him myself soon, too.

296
00:41:44,312 --> 00:41:47,429
Kanta, hurry up! You'll be late!

297
00:42:31,232 --> 00:42:32,347
Mei?

298
00:42:32,952 --> 00:42:33,987
Excuse me!

299
00:42:34,232 --> 00:42:35,665
Yes, Satsuki?

300
00:42:36,272 --> 00:42:37,910
It's my sister…

301
00:42:45,072 --> 00:42:46,710
What happened, Nanny?

302
00:42:46,992 --> 00:42:51,543
I'm sorry. She insisted that she be with you.

303
00:42:52,072 --> 00:42:56,463
It's Dad's day at the university.

304
00:42:56,712 --> 00:42:59,670
You promised to be a good girl at Nanny's.

305
00:43:02,672 --> 00:43:06,745
I still have two more classes and Nanny's too busy for this…

306
00:43:07,232 --> 00:43:12,181
She was good up 'til now, weren't you?

307
00:43:19,712 --> 00:43:21,623
I'll go talk to my teacher.

308
00:43:27,792 --> 00:43:35,028
Since Satsuki's mother is in the hospital, I want you all to be nice to her.

309
00:43:42,152 --> 00:43:43,551
What's that?

310
00:43:43,712 --> 00:43:44,986
It's Totoro.

311
00:43:45,672 --> 00:43:48,550
Mei, you should keep quiet.

312
00:43:48,712 --> 00:43:49,667
Okay.

313
00:44:00,032 --> 00:44:02,626
Bye bye, Mei!

314
00:44:03,032 --> 00:44:04,590
I can't stay after class today.

315
00:44:04,752 --> 00:44:06,583
We'll let teacher know.

316
00:44:06,792 --> 00:44:08,191
See you!

317
00:44:09,912 --> 00:44:11,550
Hurry up, it's going to rain!

318
00:44:11,712 --> 00:44:12,622
Okay.

319
00:44:20,832 --> 00:44:22,185
Here it comes!

320
00:44:34,552 --> 00:44:35,302
Here.

321
00:44:39,352 --> 00:44:41,707
I won't cry. Aren't I good?

322
00:44:44,232 --> 00:44:46,666
It's getting worse…

323
00:44:48,912 --> 00:44:52,382
Dear Guardian Spirit, let us stay until the rain stops.

324
00:45:35,992 --> 00:45:37,220
But…

325
00:45:57,672 --> 00:45:59,742
That was lucky.

326
00:46:00,912 --> 00:46:02,823
It's got holes in it.

327
00:46:14,712 --> 00:46:16,907
Daddy forgot his umbrella.

328
00:46:17,192 --> 00:46:18,830
I'm going, too.

329
00:46:22,152 --> 00:46:23,870
I said I forgot it!

330
00:46:24,072 --> 00:46:27,462
What idiot forgets his umbrella on a rainy day?

331
00:46:27,992 --> 00:46:29,345
Ouch!

332
00:46:29,752 --> 00:46:31,743
You broke it playing, I bet.

333
00:46:31,912 --> 00:46:33,140
I did not!

334
00:46:46,592 --> 00:46:47,866
Excuse me.

335
00:46:50,112 --> 00:46:53,900
Hello Satsuki. Hi, Mei. Grandma!

336
00:46:55,312 --> 00:46:56,711
I'm sorry about Mei today.

337
00:46:56,912 --> 00:46:58,903
Not at all. Sorry we couldn't do more.

338
00:46:59,272 --> 00:47:02,309
Kanta lent us this umbrella.

339
00:47:02,512 --> 00:47:06,061
He did? A broken old thing like that!

340
00:47:06,632 --> 00:47:08,782
Mei was with me, so I was glad.

341
00:47:09,032 --> 00:47:12,547
But I'm so sorry that Kanta got wet.

342
00:47:12,952 --> 00:47:17,548
Not at all. It probably cleaned him up a little.

343
00:47:18,032 --> 00:47:19,306
Are you off to meet your father?

344
00:47:19,552 --> 00:47:20,109
Yes.

345
00:47:20,352 --> 00:47:21,865
What good girls you are.

346
00:47:22,312 --> 00:47:24,303
Bye bye, Mei.

347
00:47:35,232 --> 00:47:36,824
Who was that?

348
00:47:42,712 --> 00:47:44,623
Just in time!

349
00:47:57,752 --> 00:47:58,901
Getting on?

350
00:48:00,232 --> 00:48:01,950
All right, drive on.

351
00:48:10,352 --> 00:48:12,547
Daddy wasn't on it.

352
00:48:12,792 --> 00:48:16,865
He'll be on the next one. Why don't you wait at Nanny's?

353
00:48:53,152 --> 00:48:54,267
Are you okay?

354
00:49:27,992 --> 00:49:29,027
Sleepy?

355
00:49:29,952 --> 00:49:34,025
I told you. Wanna go to Nanny's?

356
00:49:35,992 --> 00:49:37,948
It won't be much longer. Hang in there.

357
00:49:44,272 --> 00:49:46,945
It's late…

358
00:49:54,552 --> 00:49:55,462
Come on.

359
00:51:19,192 --> 00:51:20,102
Are you Totoro?

360
00:51:30,432 --> 00:51:32,229
Wait a minute.

361
00:51:37,992 --> 00:51:39,186
You can use this.

362
00:51:40,552 --> 00:51:42,668
Take it, Mei's slipping off.

363
00:51:49,232 --> 00:51:50,631
Hold it like this.

364
00:53:07,672 --> 00:53:08,821
Here's the bus!

365
00:54:16,392 --> 00:54:20,067
He took Daddy's umbrella…

366
00:54:33,392 --> 00:54:34,541
I'm sorry.

367
00:54:34,752 --> 00:54:35,787
All right, drive on.

368
00:54:36,592 --> 00:54:39,664
The train was late and I missed the bus.

369
00:54:40,432 --> 00:54:42,150
Were you worried?

370
00:54:42,752 --> 00:54:44,868
We met him, Dad! He was here!

371
00:54:45,072 --> 00:54:46,710
And the Cat Bus!

372
00:54:47,232 --> 00:54:48,301
What?

373
00:54:48,552 --> 00:54:50,224
It was huge!

374
00:54:50,392 --> 00:54:54,305
With big eyes like these!

375
00:54:55,272 --> 00:54:59,424
We met him! We met Totoro!

376
00:54:59,992 --> 00:55:01,584
How wonderful!

377
00:55:13,312 --> 00:55:14,461
Come on, Daddy.

378
00:55:22,552 --> 00:55:26,340
Dear Mother, I can't tell you how excited I was today.

379
00:55:26,512 --> 00:55:31,188
It was the scariest, funniest day I've ever had.

380
00:55:31,392 --> 00:55:33,667
Totoro gave us a lovely present…

381
00:55:33,992 --> 00:55:38,304
…wrapped in bamboo leaves and tied with dragon whiskers.

382
00:55:38,512 --> 00:55:43,381
When we opened it, it was full of magic nuts and seeds!

383
00:55:48,312 --> 00:55:54,262
We decided to plant them in the garden to make a lovely forest.

384
00:55:54,512 --> 00:56:01,111
But they haven't sprouted yet. Mei sits there all day, waiting for them.

385
00:56:02,272 --> 00:56:05,787
She looks like a little crab.

386
00:56:10,872 --> 00:56:12,464
It's nearly summer vacation.

387
00:56:12,752 --> 00:56:17,109
Dearest, dear Mom, get well soon. Love, Satsuki.

388
00:56:20,512 --> 00:56:22,548
Come on. Bed time.

389
00:56:26,592 --> 00:56:27,263
Lights off!

390
00:56:27,432 --> 00:56:28,911
Wait, Dad.

391
00:56:29,512 --> 00:56:32,185
Daddy, do you think they will sprout tomorrow?

392
00:56:32,392 --> 00:56:37,466
Well, I'm sure Totoro would know. Night night.

393
00:57:26,592 --> 00:57:27,707
Mei!

394
00:57:45,752 --> 00:57:47,504
That's where we planted the seeds.

395
00:59:19,992 --> 00:59:22,267
Wow, we did it!

396
01:00:37,752 --> 01:00:40,550
We're the wind!

397
01:01:41,432 --> 01:01:42,990
There are no trees!

398
01:01:47,912 --> 01:01:49,743
Yessss!

399
01:01:52,872 --> 01:01:53,782
It was a dream.

400
01:01:53,992 --> 01:01:56,222
But it wasn't a dream.

401
01:01:57,832 --> 01:02:00,824
We did it!

402
01:02:17,592 --> 01:02:22,905
Mr. Kusakabe! Telegram!

403
01:02:27,512 --> 01:02:29,104
Anyone home?

404
01:02:35,872 --> 01:02:38,227
Nanny

405
01:02:42,432 --> 01:02:43,751
I'm here.

406
01:02:45,872 --> 01:02:47,703
This one is ripe.

407
01:02:57,032 --> 01:02:58,511
What about this one?

408
01:02:58,712 --> 01:03:00,065
That's good, too.

409
01:03:06,312 --> 01:03:09,509
Your garden's a treasure house.

410
01:03:10,152 --> 01:03:12,586
Let's take a little break.

411
01:03:18,752 --> 01:03:21,346
These should be cold now.

412
01:03:21,912 --> 01:03:23,391
Looks delicious.

413
01:03:32,752 --> 01:03:34,071
So good.

414
01:03:34,232 --> 01:03:40,068
The sun blessed these so they're really good for you.

415
01:03:40,592 --> 01:03:42,389
Would they help my Mom, too?

416
01:03:42,552 --> 01:03:47,467
Of course. If she eats my vegetables, she'll get better right away.

417
01:03:47,992 --> 01:03:50,506
She's supposed to be back next Saturday.

418
01:03:50,752 --> 01:03:52,708
She'll sleep in my bed!

419
01:03:53,432 --> 01:03:56,026
At last. That's wonderful.

420
01:03:56,232 --> 01:04:02,671
But it's only for a couple of days. To get used to the new house.

421
01:04:03,232 --> 01:04:07,225
I see. We'll feed her lots of vegetables, then.

422
01:04:07,432 --> 01:04:10,868
I'll give her this corn I picked.

423
01:04:11,032 --> 01:04:12,784
I'm sure she'll be very pleased.

424
01:04:13,392 --> 01:04:14,871
Yes!

425
01:04:22,512 --> 01:04:24,548
There was a telegram for you.

426
01:04:24,792 --> 01:04:25,622
For us?

427
01:04:30,032 --> 01:04:32,102
Dad won't be back till late, what shall I do?

428
01:04:32,752 --> 01:04:35,061
Open it, it might be important.

429
01:04:39,112 --> 01:04:42,946
PLEASE CONTACT, HOSPITAL…

430
01:04:43,232 --> 01:04:48,386
It's from Mom's hospital! Something's happened to her!

431
01:04:50,672 --> 01:04:52,663
Nanny! What shall I do?

432
01:04:52,872 --> 01:04:56,831
Calm down. Do you know where your Dad is?

433
01:04:57,032 --> 01:05:00,183
I know his office number, but we don't have a telephone.

434
01:05:00,392 --> 01:05:04,544
Kanta, take her to use the phone in the main house!

435
01:05:09,832 --> 01:05:12,824
Mei, stay here with me!

436
01:05:21,952 --> 01:05:23,783
Stay with Nanny, Mei!

437
01:06:01,192 --> 01:06:03,945
Hello, I'd like to make a long-distance call, please.

438
01:06:04,992 --> 01:06:09,429
It's Tokyo 31-1382.

439
01:06:10,952 --> 01:06:14,069
A cute girl, Kanta.

440
01:06:16,592 --> 01:06:18,947
Hello? Yes?

441
01:06:20,152 --> 01:06:25,101
Hello, may I speak to Dad… er… Mr. Kusakabe?

442
01:06:26,032 --> 01:06:27,784
It's his daughter, Satsuki.

443
01:06:31,992 --> 01:06:33,869
Daddy? It‘s me, Satsuki!

444
01:06:34,072 --> 01:06:39,829
Hello, what's up? From the hospital?

445
01:06:40,072 --> 01:06:42,711
Okay, I'll call them right away.

446
01:06:42,872 --> 01:06:45,705
Is there anything wrong with Mom?

447
01:06:45,912 --> 01:06:52,147
Don't worry. I'll check and call you right back.

448
01:06:53,872 --> 01:06:55,385
I'm hanging up now, stay there.

449
01:06:57,872 --> 01:07:01,342
May I stay here until he calls back?

450
01:07:01,952 --> 01:07:04,068
Stay as long as you like.

451
01:07:11,552 --> 01:07:13,622
Satsuki!

452
01:07:22,272 --> 01:07:25,230
No, this corn is for my Mommy!

453
01:07:27,032 --> 01:07:30,263
No, it's my Mom's!

454
01:07:46,392 --> 01:07:52,547
Listen Mei. Mom's not well so she's not coming home this time.

455
01:07:53,072 --> 01:07:54,266
No!

456
01:07:55,432 --> 01:07:59,107
There's nothing we can do. You don't want her to get worse, do you?

457
01:07:59,392 --> 01:08:00,871
No!

458
01:08:02,112 --> 01:08:04,148
It's just for a few more days.

459
01:08:07,472 --> 01:08:09,463
So you don't care if she dies, do you?

460
01:08:12,072 --> 01:08:14,461
Stop being silly! I'm going.

461
01:08:25,552 --> 01:08:26,507
Let's go, Mei.

462
01:08:30,152 --> 01:08:33,701
I hate you, Satsuki!

463
01:09:00,512 --> 01:09:04,300
We should bring the washing in…

464
01:09:04,832 --> 01:09:11,590
Don't worry too much, Satsuki. Nanny's here to help, so cheer up.

465
01:09:15,512 --> 01:09:19,585
Your Dad said he'll stop by the hospital to check on her.

466
01:09:20,312 --> 01:09:27,150
Besides, it's just a cold; she'll be back next week.

467
01:09:31,512 --> 01:09:35,187
They said it was just a cold…

468
01:09:36,192 --> 01:09:37,910
when she went into hospital.

469
01:09:39,512 --> 01:09:41,309
But what if she dies!

470
01:09:41,592 --> 01:09:43,310
Don't be silly, Satsuki.

471
01:09:44,152 --> 01:09:46,347
Maybe Mom will…

472
01:09:49,792 --> 01:09:56,709
Stop it. Nobody would leave two pretty little girls like you.

473
01:09:57,712 --> 01:10:01,307
There, there. Don't cry.

474
01:10:01,512 --> 01:10:06,347
I'll be here until Daddy comes back, okay?

475
01:10:48,232 --> 01:10:51,383
Mei!

476
01:10:55,752 --> 01:10:57,549
Mei!

477
01:11:00,472 --> 01:11:02,702
Mei!

478
01:11:05,592 --> 01:11:06,661
Did she come back?

479
01:11:06,872 --> 01:11:09,466
Wasn't she at the bus stop?

480
01:11:10,672 --> 01:11:13,709
That's strange. Where has she gone?

481
01:11:14,392 --> 01:11:17,623
I was nasty to her, 'cause she was being silly…

482
01:11:18,152 --> 01:11:20,712
Maybe she's heading for the hospital!

483
01:11:20,952 --> 01:11:26,788
The hospital? It would take a grown-up three hours!

484
01:11:27,032 --> 01:11:27,748
I'll go look!

485
01:11:29,312 --> 01:11:36,309
Kanta, hurry! Tell your dad that Mei is missing!

486
01:11:45,432 --> 01:11:48,185
Stupid Mei. Always getting lost.

487
01:11:56,032 --> 01:11:58,227
Mei!

488
01:12:05,272 --> 01:12:07,308
Excuse me.

489
01:12:09,272 --> 01:12:13,470
Have you seen a little girl pass by? She's my sister.

490
01:12:13,792 --> 01:12:19,150
No, I don't think so. I'm sure I would've noticed…

491
01:12:20,192 --> 01:12:21,864
Maybe she wasn't here.

492
01:12:41,392 --> 01:12:43,303
Are you sure she came this way?

493
01:12:43,472 --> 01:12:45,190
I don't know.

494
01:12:53,312 --> 01:12:55,428
Mei!

495
01:13:16,872 --> 01:13:18,624
Please, stop!

496
01:13:21,392 --> 01:13:22,381
Jerk! What are you doing?!

497
01:13:22,592 --> 01:13:25,425
I'm looking for my sister. Have you seen a little girl?

498
01:13:26,472 --> 01:13:27,507
Your little sister?

499
01:13:27,872 --> 01:13:31,467
She's four. I think she's heading to the hospital.

500
01:13:32,032 --> 01:13:33,260
Did you see anyone?

501
01:13:33,432 --> 01:13:38,904
No. We just came from there… but we didn't see anyone.

502
01:13:40,072 --> 01:13:41,744
Thanks anyway.

503
01:13:42,912 --> 01:13:44,470
Where have you come from?

504
01:13:44,712 --> 01:13:46,111
From Matsugo.

505
01:13:47,752 --> 01:13:49,424
Really?

506
01:13:50,792 --> 01:13:52,191
Good luck.

507
01:14:03,472 --> 01:14:04,985
Satsuki!

508
01:14:06,472 --> 01:14:08,667
Kanta!

509
01:14:09,512 --> 01:14:10,388
Find her?

510
01:14:10,552 --> 01:14:12,270
No. And you?

511
01:14:13,112 --> 01:14:17,424
Dad and the others are looking for her. I'll go to the hospital,

512
01:14:17,672 --> 01:14:19,230
you go back home.

513
01:14:19,472 --> 01:14:23,306
I guess she got lost on the way to the hospital.

514
01:14:23,672 --> 01:14:26,470
They found a sandal by the pond.

515
01:14:33,752 --> 01:14:36,585
We're not sure if it's hers or not!

516
01:14:53,752 --> 01:14:55,504
Did you find her?

517
01:15:26,792 --> 01:15:31,149
Dear Lord, please protect her and…

518
01:15:31,592 --> 01:15:33,822
It's too deep here, better search further away!

519
01:15:34,072 --> 01:15:36,142
Hey, are there any poles left?

520
01:15:44,952 --> 01:15:46,988
Grandma, Satsuki's here!

521
01:15:51,752 --> 01:15:53,504
Nanny!

522
01:15:54,592 --> 01:15:56,583
Look, is it hers?

523
01:16:05,752 --> 01:16:06,582
No, it isn't.

524
01:16:17,552 --> 01:16:23,070
Thank heavens, I was sure it was hers.

525
01:16:23,272 --> 01:16:25,991
Hey, Nanny was jumping to conclusions.

526
01:16:26,192 --> 01:16:27,625
It's not hers!

527
01:16:27,832 --> 01:16:29,663
Where's she gone then?

528
01:16:29,832 --> 01:16:31,265
Let's start from scratch.

529
01:16:31,512 --> 01:16:32,945
We better hurry, it'll be dark soon.

530
01:16:33,152 --> 01:16:36,781
I really appreciate your help, everyone.

531
01:16:36,992 --> 01:16:39,062
Don't worry. Could have been any of us.

532
01:17:06,992 --> 01:17:10,029
Please, help me Totoro!

533
01:17:10,232 --> 01:17:16,023
Mei is lost. It'll be dark soon. I'm sure she's scared somewhere…

534
01:17:46,872 --> 01:17:47,987
Totoro!

535
01:17:49,992 --> 01:17:53,871
Mei is lost and we can't find her!

536
01:17:54,632 --> 01:17:59,911
She must be scared, please help me find her.

537
01:18:01,312 --> 01:18:03,826
I don't know what to do…

538
01:19:02,472 --> 01:19:03,985
They can't see the bus.

539
01:19:51,752 --> 01:19:54,141
FOREST—SWAMP

540
01:19:54,352 --> 01:19:56,661
CEMETERY—SHRINE

541
01:19:56,832 --> 01:19:58,743
MEI

542
01:20:15,752 --> 01:20:18,186
Mei!

543
01:20:27,832 --> 01:20:29,026
The trees are moving out of the way!

544
01:21:06,352 --> 01:21:08,661
Satsuki!

545
01:21:23,392 --> 01:21:24,347
Mei!

546
01:21:29,032 --> 01:21:30,021
You silly girl.

547
01:21:30,272 --> 01:21:32,183
I'm sorry.

548
01:21:34,672 --> 01:21:37,869
You wanted to take the corn to Mom?

549
01:21:45,832 --> 01:21:48,266
HOSPITAL

550
01:21:49,952 --> 01:21:51,943
Will you take us to the hospital?

551
01:21:54,392 --> 01:21:55,950
Thank you so much.

552
01:22:05,072 --> 01:22:09,623
I'm sorry. They didn't need to send a telegram just for a cold.

553
01:22:09,992 --> 01:22:14,349
The girls must be worried. I'm sorry to upset them.

554
01:22:14,752 --> 01:22:17,220
They'll be fine. As long as you're okay.

555
01:22:17,472 --> 01:22:22,466
We've all learned to cope. This'll just postpone the enjoyment.

556
01:22:24,112 --> 01:22:27,548
They've put up with it so well.

557
01:22:27,832 --> 01:22:30,790
I'm especially sorry for Satsuki, she's been so patient.

558
01:22:31,992 --> 01:22:33,141
You're right.

559
01:22:33,872 --> 01:22:37,865
I'm going to spoil them for a while when I come home.

560
01:22:38,072 --> 01:22:38,902
Oh no!

561
01:22:46,392 --> 01:22:48,110
She's laughing!

562
01:22:48,352 --> 01:22:49,944
Looks like she's fine.

563
01:22:58,352 --> 01:23:01,264
I can't wait to get back on my feet.

564
01:23:03,152 --> 01:23:04,028
Look.

565
01:23:10,432 --> 01:23:12,024
Where did that come from?

566
01:23:13,952 --> 01:23:14,862
What?

567
01:23:15,552 --> 01:23:18,942
I could swear I just saw Satsuki and Mei laughing up in that tree.

568
01:23:22,152 --> 01:23:24,029
Maybe they were too. Look.

569
01:23:24,992 --> 01:23:27,426
'For Mother'
