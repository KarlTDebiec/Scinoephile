不过我还是偶尔会来打扫
but I did manage to keep the place well-dusted, as you can see.

167
00:14:09,144 --> 00:14:12,314
小美，妳手怎么脏兮兮的？
Mei, your hands are filthy. What on earth did you do?

168
00:14:11,476 --> 00:14:12,435
怎么弄的？

169
00:14:12,481 --> 00:14:15,229
灰尘精灵跑掉了
I caught a soot gremlin, but he got away.

170
00:14:14,441 --> 00:14:17,315
妳看妳的脚
Ahh! Your feet!

Mine are black, too!

Ah…

174

哎呀呀！

175
00:14:31,166 --> 00:14:34,374
看样子是煤煤虫在作怪
You've got soot sprites in your house.

176
00:14:34,211 --> 00:14:35,835
煤煤虫？
Soot sprites? The black puff balls? About this big?

177
00:14:35,835 --> 00:14:37,460
你说的煤煤虫是不是会
Soot sprites? The black puff balls? About this big?

178
00:14:37,548 --> 00:14:39,508
〝哇啦哇啦〞的乱跑啊
They scurry everywhere when you enter a room?

179
00:14:39,508 --> 00:14:41,468
〝哇啦哇啦〞的乱跑啊
That's right.

180
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:42,298
是啊

181
00:14:41,635 --> 00:14:45,343
它们专门跑到没人住的旧房子里
They live in old, empty houses

182
00:14:44,805 --> 00:14:49,476
然后弄得满屋子的灰尘和煤灰
and run all over the place, covering everything with dirt.

183
00:14:49,643 --> 00:14:53,434
我小时候也有看过
I used to be able to see them when I was your age.

184
00:14:53,314 --> 00:14:57,397
想不到妳们也看到
So you've seen them, too. That's very interesting.

185
00:14:56,984 --> 00:14:59,403
婆婆，它们是妖怪吗？
So they're a kind of ghost, then?

186
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:04,195
其实也没什么好怕的
Don't worry, dear. They're nothing to be afraid of.

187
00:15:03,324 --> 00:15:07,281
只要对它们笑笑　它们就不会害人
If they decide you're nice people, they won't harm you,

188
00:15:06,869 --> 00:15:10,326
住上一阵子之后　它们自然就会不见
and after a while, they'll just go away.

189
00:15:09,371 --> 00:15:11,123
I bet they're up in the rafters right now,

190
00:15:11,202 --> 00:15:15,711
说不定它们已经在天花板上　讨论该搬去哪里了
having a talk about whether or not they should move out.

(JABBERING)

192
00:15:20,299 --> 00:15:23,510

- Hear that, Mei? They're gonna move out.    - I don't want them to leave.

193
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:24,257
不好玩

194
00:15:23,677 --> 00:15:26,467
可是要是来这么一大堆　该怎么办？
What if a huge one came chasing after you?

195
00:15:26,513 --> 00:15:28,344
人家才不怕那些
So what? I'm not afraid.

196
00:15:28,098 --> 00:15:30,267
是吗？
Right. Then you can go to the bathroom

197
00:15:29,387 --> 00:15:32,473
那以后晚上　姐姐就不陪妳上厕所
by yourself in the middle of the night.

Let's get to work. Who'd like to fetch some water for the pump?

201
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:39,397

Keep pumping!

Don't stop until the water gets cold.

It can't be helped, Mei.

789
01:07:56,452 --> 01:07:58,866
妈妈要是勉强出院　反而更严重了那怎么办
What if she came home early, and it made her even worse?

790
01:07:58,704 --> 01:08:00,827
我不要！
It's not fair!

791
01:08:01,791 --> 01:08:04,664
不过是晚几天而已
Mei, we just have to wait a little longer.

792
01:08:04,126 --> 01:08:08,297
我不要！
- No!    - You want her to die, Mei?

793
01:08:06,874 --> 01:08:09,356
那妈妈死掉　也没有关系是不是
- Is that what you want?    - No!

794
01:08:09,356 --> 01:08:11,838
不要！
- Is that what you want?    - No!

795
01:08:11,717 --> 01:08:14,345
妳这个大笨蛋！
You're such a baby! Just grow up!

796
01:08:13,673 --> 01:08:14,882
我不管妳了！

797
01:08:25,356 --> 01:08:27,524
走吧
Come on, Mei.

798
01:08:27,524 --> 01:08:29,693
走吧

Come on, girls. Let's put the laundry away.

01:09:02,432 --> 01:09:04,724
别这么沮丧
Come on, girls. Let's put the laundry away.

803
01:09:04,186 --> 01:09:07,731
婆婆不是过来帮忙了吗
Oh, don't be sad. Granny's here to help.

804
01:09:07,685 --> 01:09:10,897
打起精神

805
01:09:15,406 --> 01:09:19,906
你爸爸说他今天　要留在医院过夜
Don't worry. Your father is going to stop by the hospital.

806
01:09:20,369 --> 01:09:23,659
妳妈妈不过是感冒而已
The doctors say your mom just has a cold.

807
01:09:23,622 --> 01:09:27,126
下个星期六一定会回来的
She should be home next Saturday.

808
01:09:31,172 --> 01:09:32,923
之前也是这样
This is just like last time.

809
01:09:33,048 --> 01:09:37,178
医生说只要住数天就会好了
They said Mom just had a little cold, she'd be home in a few days.

810
01:09:36,631 --> 01:09:38,758
而且那次也是说得了感冒

811
01:09:38,888 --> 01:09:41,886
我妈妈要是死了该怎么办
Granny, what will we do if she dies?

815
01:09:49,607 --> 01:09:52,730
妳放心，不要乱想
Now, don't say that, sweetheart.

816
01:09:52,772 --> 01:09:57,652
妳妈妈哪舍得下　妳们这些可爱的孩子
How could she ever leave such sweet girls like you?

817
01:09:57,364 --> 01:09:59,658
别哭了别哭了
Oh, don't cry.

818
01:09:59,658 --> 01:10:01,952
别哭了别哭了
Don't cry. It's all right.

819
01:10:01,697 --> 01:10:03,782
在妳爸爸回来之前
I'll stay here until your father comes home. Okay? Okay?

820
01:10:03,782 --> 01:10:05,868
婆婆都会陪着妳的　好不好呀

825
01:11:06,846 --> 01:11:10,396
没在公车站牌那边吗？
- She wasn't at the bus stop?    - No.

826
01:11:10,562 --> 01:11:11,851

Let's think.

827
01:11:11,605 --> 01:11:13,853
她会跑到哪里去了？
Do you know anywhere else she might have gone?

828
01:11:13,895 --> 01:11:15,834
我刚刚跟小美吵了一架
I yelled at her this morning. She wanted Mom to come home.

829
01:11:15,834 --> 01:11:17,773
因为她⋯
I yelled at her this morning. She wanted Mom to come home.

830
01:11:17,778 --> 01:11:20,739
她会不会　跑去妈妈住的医院了
Granny, I bet she went to see Mom at the hospital!

831
01:11:20,818 --> 01:11:23,696
七国山医院去了呀
You think she'd try to walk to the hospital?

832
01:11:23,200 --> 01:11:26,741
可是就连大人也得　走上三个钟头才会到
Why, that's a three-hour walk even for grown-ups.

833
01:11:26,412 --> 01:11:28,701
我去看看
I'll go look.

834
01:11:29,660 --> 01:11:33,748
勘太　快点去叫你爸爸回来
Kanta! Hurry! Run on home and get your father!

835
01:11:33,127 --> 01:11:36,834
小美不见了
Mei's disappeared, and we need all the help we can get!

836
01:11:44,967 --> 01:11:48,721
小美真是笨蛋　不知道路又爱乱跑
I shouldn't have yelled at her. This is all my fault.

01:12:07,578 --> 01:12:11,744
您有没有看见束辫子的小女孩　从这条路经过
- Yeah?    - I'm looking for my sister.

840
01:12:10,539 --> 01:12:13,167
她是我妹妹
Did you happen to see a little girl pass this way?

841
01:12:13,334 --> 01:12:16,045
这个嘛⋯⋯小女孩啊
Let's see. Uh, a little girl?

842
01:12:16,211 --> 01:12:19,798
没什么印象
Mmm, I don't think so. I would have noticed.

843
01:12:19,835 --> 01:12:21,921
她会不会没往这边来
I'll try the other road.

844
01:12:40,569 --> 01:12:43,109
妳确定她是往这边来的？
MAN: Are you sure that this is the way she came?

- Oh! Are you crazy?    - I'm looking for my little sister.

850
01:13:22,379 --> 01:13:23,774
我在找我妹妹
- Oh! Are you crazy?    - I'm looking for my little sister.

851
01:13:23,487 --> 01:13:26,198
你们有没有看一个小女孩
Have you seen a girl walking this way?

852
01:13:25,901 --> 01:13:27,695
妳妹妹？
Is she lost?

853
01:13:27,491 --> 01:13:29,616
她好像是往七国山医院去了
I think she's trying to walk to the hospital. She's only four years old.

854
01:13:29,616 --> 01:13:31,741
她是一个四岁的小女孩
I think she's trying to walk to the hospital. She's only four years old.

Oh. I didn't see her. Did you?

856
01:13:34,206 --> 01:13:36,746
我们两个　就是从那个方向来的
No. We just came from the hospital,

857
01:13:36,500 --> 01:13:39,962
不过　好像没有看到那样的小孩
and there was no sign of a little girl on the road.

01:13:39,790 --> 01:13:42,423
谢谢你们
Okay. Thanks.

859
01:13:42,589 --> 01:13:45,134
你从哪里来的？
- Wait. Where'd you say you're from?    - From Matsugo.

860
01:13:44,712 --> 01:13:45,838
松乡
Matsugo! Ho!

861
01:13:45,838 --> 01:13:46,964

没看到，那妳呢？
- I guess you didn't, either.    - Mmm-mmm.

现在我爸爸他们也去找了
My dad's got a bunch of people looking for her.

870
01:14:14,867 --> 01:14:17,578
我去往七国山的路上看看
I could ride my bike to the hospital for you.

871
01:14:17,662 --> 01:14:19,960
妳先回家去
- You should go back home.    - Check all around.

872

我想小美一定是想去医院
I'm sure that Mei got lost on her way to the hospital, okay?

可是却走错路了
I'm sure that Mei got lost on her way to the hospital, okay?

01:21:49,409 --> 01:21:51,912
你要送我们去医院吗？
You're going to take us to the hospital?

943
01:21:53,951 --> 01:21:55,559
谢谢你
Thank you!

944
01:21:55,559 --> 01:21:57,167
谢谢你
(LAUGHING)

945
01:22:04,215 --> 01:22:07,427
对不起，只不过是感冒
I'm sorry. I don't know why the hospital sent a telegram.

946
01:22:07,047 --> 01:22:09,842
医院就擅自决定　发电报给家里了
It's just a cold.

947
01:22:09,512 --> 01:22:11,973
那两个孩子一定都很担心我吧
I hope it didn't upset the girls too much. I've caused them enough grief already.

948
01:22:11,973 --> 01:22:14,434
真是苦了她们了
I hope it didn't upset the girls too much. I've caused them enough grief already.

949
01:22:14,601 --> 01:22:17,062
她们知道你平安就会安心的
When they see you're all right, they'll be fine.

950
01:22:17,015 --> 01:22:20,023
这些年来我们一家四口
We'll just wait a little longer for a weekend together.

951
01:22:18,934 --> 01:22:20,727
不都这样努力过来的吗？

952
01:22:20,190 --> 01:22:23,568
享福之前总得吃点苦啊
Don't worry. We've made it this far.

953
01:22:23,735 --> 01:22:27,025
她们表面好像没事　可是心里一定很难过
The girls act so strong, but I think it's been harder than they let on.

954
01:22:27,113 --> 01:22:28,239
Especially Satsuki.

955
01:22:27,776 --> 01:22:32,953
小月越是懂事　就越教人于心不忍
- She tries to act so adult.    - That's true.

956
01:22:31,780 --> 01:22:33,031
是啊

957
01:22:33,119 --> 01:22:35,868
出院以后我一定要好好疼她们
I can't wait until I get better.

958
01:22:34,746 --> 01:22:38,036
让她们尽情耍耍小脾气
When I get home, I'm going to spoil those girls rotten.

959
01:22:37,624 --> 01:22:38,625
(LAUGHING)

960
01:22:38,792 --> 01:22:40,460
(INAUDIBLE)

961
01:22:45,799 --> 01:22:48,172
妈妈在笑
Look at Mom. She's laughing.

962
01:22:47,842 --> 01:22:50,720
看样子是没事了
- Everything must be okay.    - Yeah.

963
01:22:58,390 --> 01:23:00,976
我得赶快把身体养好才行
I'm going to hurry up and get well!

964
01:23:00,605 --> 01:23:03,233
是啊
That's the spirit. Huh?

965
01:23:10,240 --> 01:23:11,760
是谁摆的啊？
Who left this?

966
01:23:11,760 --> 01:23:13,280
是谁摆的啊？
(GASPS)

967
01:23:13,618 --> 01:23:14,990
怎么啦？
What is it?

968
01:23:15,286 --> 01:23:19,411
我好像看到小月和小美坐在那棵松树上笑
I thought I saw Satsuki and Mei smiling at us from up in that tree.

969
01:23:21,543 --> 01:23:23,790
搞不好是真的也说不定啊
It sounds crazy, but maybe you did.

970
01:23:23,874 --> 01:23:25,917
妳看
- Look at this.    - “For Mommy.”

971
01:23:25,917 --> 01:23:27,961
〝送给妈妈〞
- Look at this.    - “For Mommy.”

972
01:23:29,759 --> 01:23:33,263

973
01:23:33,430 --> 01:23:36,641
