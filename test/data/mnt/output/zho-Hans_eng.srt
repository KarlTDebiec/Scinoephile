00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:36,073
谢谢

4
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:37,699
你们两个累不累啊
- Hey Dad, want some caramel?    - Thanks. How you doing back there?

5
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:39,409
就快到了
- Hey Dad, want some caramel?    - Thanks. How you doing back there?

6
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:40,952
- Fine.    - Are you tired? Oop!

7
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:43,372
- Mmm-mmm.    - We're almost there.

8
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:51,797
小美，快躲起来

9
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:59,199
还以为是警察呢！
Mei, hide.

10
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:03,433
还以为是警察呢！
Whoops. I thought that was a policeman.

11
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:05,227
Hi!

00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:10,190
(BOTH LAUGHING)

13
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:35,257
有没有人在家啊？

14
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:39,177
谢谢
Hello there. Are your parents around? We're your new neighbors.

15

我姓草壁　新搬来的
Great. Thanks.

16
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:47,247
请多关照
Hello! Hi, we're the Kusakabes! We're moving in down the street.

17
00:03:47,247 --> 00:03:50,188
搬家辛苦了
Hello! Hi, we're the Kusakabes! We're moving in down the street.

18
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:51,648
Why don't you and your family stop by sometime?

19
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:53,316
MAN: Okay, sure. Good to meet you.

20

Uh!

00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:00,240
Hey, thanks a lot.

25
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:26,725
小美，有座桥啊
- Wait up!    - Here you go.

26
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,101
有桥？

27
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:30,353
Mei, look at this bridge.

28
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:34,608
有鱼呢，又闪了一下
A bridge?

29
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:39,321
怎么样？喜不喜欢？
There's a fish! Oh, look! There's another one!

30
00:04:39,488 --> 00:04:42,282
爸爸，这里好棒啊
So, how do you like the new place?

31
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:45,744
树林中还有隧道啊
Dad, it's perfect.

32
00:04:45,911 --> 00:04:49,331
那就是新家吗？
Look at this. A tunnel of trees.

33
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:52,083
Oh, wow! Look!

34
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:54,628
跑快一点！
(GIGGLING)

35
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:58,673
Dad, hurry!

36
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:09,309
很旧啊

37
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:11,228
很旧啊

38
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:13,188
好像一间鬼屋
Wow! It's creepy.

39
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:14,856
鬼屋
Creepy!

40
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:18,151
- It looks like it could be haunted.    - What, haunted?

00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:21,279

妳看
- Mei, look at that.    - Huh?

55
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,232
Look.

56
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:08,785
好大啊
- Wow! It's huge, isn't it?    - Ah-choo!

57
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:10,641
爸爸，好大的树啊

爸爸，好大的树啊
(DOORS SLIDING)

59
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:15,625
那叫做樟树
Dad, what's that big tree?

60
00:06:15,834 --> 00:06:18,003
樟树呢
Uh, that's a camphor tree.

61
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,170
樟树

62
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,382
- A camphor tree.    - Camphor tree!

63
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:25,010
Don't forget to take your shoes off, girls.

64
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:27,470
Huh?

65
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:33,351
橡果子
Whoa!

66
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:38,106
我看一下
An acorn.

67
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:41,234
那里也有
Let me see.

68
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,778
Another one!

69
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:45,926
捡到了
(GRUNTING)

70
00:06:45,926 --> 00:06:47,908
捡到了

71
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:48,992
Here's one.

73
00:06:52,287 --> 00:06:55,373
别玩了　这样木门打不开

74
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:57,688
橡果子
Out of the way, Mei. I can't close the door with you there.

75
00:06:57,688 --> 00:06:59,252
有很多橡果子掉到屋里
Out of the way, Mei. I can't close the door with you there.

76
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:01,296
从上面掉下来的
Acorns.

77
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:02,923
Dad, acorns are falling from the ceiling.

78
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:04,758
Falling from the ceiling.

79
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:08,386
该不会是我们家有松鼠吧
Hmm.

80
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:10,388
松鼠？

81
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:12,828
还是　吃橡果子的老鼠呢？
Maybe squirrels live here.

82
00:07:12,828 --> 00:07:14,768
还是　吃橡果子的老鼠呢？
- Squirrels?    - Squirrels?

83
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:16,686
我喜欢松鼠
I think rats eat acorns. Maybe they're rats.

84
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:19,105
这要搬到哪儿呢？
I think rats eat acorns. Maybe they're rats.

85
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:20,023
- No! Squirrels are better!    - Ew!

86
00:07:19,314 --> 00:07:21,253
放这里，我这就开门
Mister, where do you want your radio?

87
00:07:21,253 --> 00:07:23,193
小月，你去把后门打开
Mister, where do you want your radio?

88
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:24,360
好
Oh, right, the radio. In here's good, I guess.

89
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,112
去了就看得到
Oh, right, the radio. In here's good, I guess.

90
00:07:25,487 --> 00:07:28,031
- Satsuki, open the back of the house?    - Okay.

91
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:30,283
快点
- Can you find the back door?    - Of course!

92
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:32,369

Hey, wait for me!

- Let's go.    - Hmph!

100
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:28,717
浴室

101
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:36,266
不见了
- The bath.    - Yep.

102
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:39,644
这间是浴室
I think they're gone.

103
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:41,146
爸爸，有怪东西
I think they're gone.

104
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:41,438
(GASPS)

105
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:42,230
松鼠吗？
Hey, you found the bath.

106
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,231
不知道
Hey, you found the bath.

107
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:44,962
不像蟑螂也不像老鼠
Dad, something's running around in here.

108
00:08:44,962 --> 00:08:46,901
不像蟑螂也不像老鼠
- More squirrels?    - I don't think so.

109
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:51,114
只知道是一堆黑色的东西
They're not bugs or mice, either. They were black, and they were all over the place.

110
00:08:51,281 --> 00:08:53,199
Hmm. Let's have a look.

111
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:02,208
有没有？

112
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:05,211
那一定是〝灰尘精灵〞
- Ah.    - So?

113
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:06,337
灰尘精灵

114
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:07,505
画册里有吗？
It was probably just some soot gremlins.

115
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:08,631
有啊
It was probably just some soot gremlins.

116
00:09:08,423 --> 00:09:11,551
今天天气那么好　不可能会有鬼的
What do you mean, “gremlins”? Like the ones in my book?

117
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:13,053
Well, it could be ghosts,

118
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:19,350
我们从光的地方　一下子进到暗的地方
but ghosts don't usually like to come out on nice days like this.

119
00:09:19,434 --> 00:09:22,479
眼睛就会发昏　灰尘精灵就会跑出来
Normally, you can't see soot gremlins, but every once in a while,

120
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:24,751
原来是这样啊
when you go from a bright place to a dark one, you can catch a glimpse of them.

121
00:09:24,751 --> 00:09:27,233
灰尘精灵快点滚出来
when you go from a bright place to a dark one, you can catch a glimpse of them.

122
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:27,901
So that's it.

123
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:29,339
你要躲着不出来　我就把你眼睛挖出来！
Come out, come out…

你要躲着不出来　我就把你眼睛挖出来！

好了，去做事
(LAUGHING)

128
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:41,372
上二楼的楼梯　到底在哪里呢？
(LAUGHING)

129
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:43,541
你们两个去把楼梯找出来
Hey, I need your help. It looks like somebody's hidden

130
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:45,335
然后把二楼的窗户打开
the stairs to the top floor of the house.

131
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:47,128
好
What?

132
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:49,297
人家也要
Can you find the stairs and open all the windows up there?

133
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:50,590
Yeah!

134
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:53,093
Wait for me!

136
00:09:57,222 --> 00:10:00,642
厕所
Nope.

137
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:02,143
甚么？
The toilet!

138
00:10:04,354 --> 00:10:07,107
甚么？
Not here.

139
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:11,236
甚么？
- Nothing here.    - Nothing here.

140
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:13,154

00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:14,989
- Nope.    - Nope.

142
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:18,243
甚么？
(LAUGHING)

143
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:20,328
没有
Ahh!

144
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:24,833
没有
Nope.

145
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:27,961
Nope. Hey!

146
00:10:32,257 --> 00:10:35,969
小美，找到了
(CREAKING)

147
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:38,221
Mei, I found the stairs.

148
00:10:41,224 --> 00:10:43,268
乌漆抹黑的
(GASPS)

149
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:46,271
灰尘精灵呢？
It's pitch-black.

150
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:48,439
Maybe it's the soot gremlins.

151
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:58,658
橡果子
An acorn.

152
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:08,793
灰尘精灵快点滚出来
Come out, come out, wherever you are!

灰尘精灵

155
00:11:45,914 --> 00:11:49,792
你在不在？
We know you're in here, soot gremlins.

156
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:52,212
Come on out.

157
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:54,672
(GASPS)

158
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:10,188
Huh?

159
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:17,153
爸爸，真的有怪东西
KUSAKABE: (GRUNTS) Okay, lift.

160
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:20,031
那真是太棒了
Dad, come here! There's definitely something weird in this house!

161
00:12:20,031 --> 00:12:23,201
爸爸从小就梦想　能够住在鬼屋里面
Dad, come here! There's definitely something weird in this house!

162
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:22,659
That's great.

163
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:25,474
糟了
I've always wanted to live in a haunted house ever since I was a little boy.

164
00:12:25,474 --> 00:12:28,081
糟了
BOTH: Oh!

165
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:29,123
Ahh!

167
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:19,966
抓到了！姐姐
I caught one! Satsuki, look!

168
00:13:26,681 --> 00:13:30,393

- Ah!    - Oof!

169
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,519
Hi.

00:13:31,686 --> 00:13:32,562
(SHRIEKS)

171
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:34,355
Mei?

172
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:37,734
(PANTING)

173
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:39,777
Oh.

174
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:42,697
好活泼啊
Whoa. Hey!

175
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:44,574
这位是一直照顾这个家
(LAUGHING)

176
00:13:44,282 --> 00:13:45,825
住在隔壁的婆婆
What a ball of energy!

177
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:47,368
婆婆今天是来帮忙的
What a ball of energy!

178
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:49,412
我叫做小月，这是我妹妹小美
This is our neighbor. She takes care of this house.

179
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:51,581
婆婆好
She said you can call her “Granny” if you'd like.

180
00:13:51,289 --> 00:13:54,959
好，你们好啊
I'm Satsuki, and that's Mei. Nice to meet you.

181
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:56,314
这孩子真是聪明伶俐
Well, it's nice to meet you, too.

182
00:13:56,314 --> 00:13:58,421
如果你们不急着搬进来
Well, it's nice to meet you, too.

183
00:13:58,046 --> 00:14:00,423
我还打算请人先收拾一下呢
What nice manners you have.

184
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:03,259
这样子已经很好了
I'm sorry I didn't have time

185
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:06,262
现在这时田里农事很忙碌呢
to clean up more before you got here.

186
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:06,596
KUSAKABE: No, it's fine.

187
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:09,265
不过我还是偶尔会来打扫
GRANNY: We've been busy in the rice fields,

188
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:11,246
小美，妳手怎么脏兮兮的？
but I did manage to keep the place well-dusted, as you can see.

189
00:14:11,246 --> 00:14:13,478
怎么弄的？
but I did manage to keep the place well-dusted, as you can see.

190
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:15,250
灰尘精灵跑掉了
Mei, your hands are filthy. What on earth did you do?

191
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:17,315
妳看妳的脚
Mei, your hands are filthy. What on earth did you do?

192
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:18,775
I caught a soot gremlin, but he got away.

193
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:20,735
Ahh! Your feet!

194
00:14:22,153 --> 00:14:25,865
我的脚也脏兮兮的
(GASPS)

195
00:14:25,323 --> 00:14:27,283
哎呀呀！
Mine are black, too!

196
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:29,243
哎呀呀！
Ah…

197
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:34,374
看样子是煤煤虫在作怪

198
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:35,416
煤煤虫？

199
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:38,544
你说的煤煤虫是不是会
You've got soot sprites in your house.

200
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:40,254
〝哇啦哇啦〞的乱跑啊
Soot sprites? The black puff balls? About this big?

201
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:42,298
是啊
Soot sprites? The black puff balls? About this big?

202
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:44,008
它们专门跑到没人住的旧房子里
They scurry everywhere when you enter a room?

203
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:45,968
它们专门跑到没人住的旧房子里
That's right.

204
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:49,347
然后弄得满屋子的灰尘和煤灰
They live in old, empty houses

205
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:53,976
我小时候也有看过
and run all over the place, covering everything with dirt.

206
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:57,647
想不到妳们也看到
I used to be able to see them when I was your age.

207
00:14:57,438 --> 00:15:01,317
婆婆，它们是妖怪吗？
So you've seen them, too. That's very interesting.

208
00:15:00,191 --> 00:15:04,195
其实也没什么好怕的
So they're a kind of ghost, then?

209
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:07,657
只要对它们笑笑　它们就不会害人
Don't worry, dear. They're nothing to be afraid of.

210
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:11,160
住上一阵子之后　它们自然就会不见
If they decide you're nice people, they won't harm you,

211
00:15:11,202 --> 00:15:13,412
说不定它们已经在天花板上　讨论该搬去哪里了
and after a while, they'll just go away.

212
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:15,623
说不定它们已经在天花板上　讨论该搬去哪里了
I bet they're up in the rafters right now,

213
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:20,211
having a talk about whether or not they should move out.

214
00:15:20,378 --> 00:15:23,214
小美，它们很快就会不见了
(JABBERING)

215
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:24,257
不好玩

216
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:26,321
可是要是来这么一大堆　该怎么办？
- Hear that, Mei? They're gonna move out.    - I don't want them to leave.

217
00:15:26,321 --> 00:15:28,344
人家才不怕那些
- Hear that, Mei? They're gonna move out.    - I don't want them to leave.

218
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:30,325
是吗？
What if a huge one came chasing after you?

219
00:15:30,325 --> 00:15:32,473
那以后晚上　姐姐就不陪妳上厕所
What if a huge one came chasing after you?

220
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:32,432
So what? I'm not afraid.

221
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:34,767
Right. Then you can go to the bathroom

222
00:15:34,392 --> 00:15:37,228
来来⋯快来打扫吧
by yourself in the middle of the night.

223
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:38,145
妳们去河边打点水回来吧
(LAUGHING)

224
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:39,689
妳们去河边打点水回来吧
Come on, girls.

225
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:41,524
河边啊
Let's get to work. Who'd like to fetch some water for the pump?

226
00:15:41,524 --> 00:15:43,401
人家也要去
Let's get to work. Who'd like to fetch some water for the pump?

227
00:15:43,568 --> 00:15:44,777
I'll go get it.

228
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,841
小美，妳在一边等着
I'll go, too!

229
00:15:46,841 --> 00:15:48,739
小美，妳在一边等着
(LAUGHING)

230
00:15:49,407 --> 00:15:52,201
Mei, wait there, okay?

231
00:15:57,206 --> 00:16:03,337
有没有抓到鱼？
Did you catch a fish?

232
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:12,680
婆婆，有水了
(GRUNTING)

233
00:16:12,847 --> 00:16:15,266
好好打啊
(SQUEALING)

234
00:16:14,265 --> 00:16:17,477
打到水变凉为止
Granny, the pump's working!

235
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:19,312
好
Keep pumping!

236
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:21,439
Don't stop until the water gets cold.

237
00:16:21,606 --> 00:16:22,899
Okay.

238
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:25,109
(LAUGHING)

239
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:04,440
你不是刚刚那个吗？　有事吗

240
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:08,444
我妈妈要给婆婆的
Oh. Hello again. Can I help you?

241
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:12,198
是什么？
Eh… My… mom said to give this to Granny.

242
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:15,076
Oh. What is it?

243
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:19,455
等等，这是什么啊
- Mmm.    - Hmm?

244
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:21,040
Mmm! Eh…

245
00:17:20,248 --> 00:17:22,875
是勘太吗？
Hey, wait! What is this?

246
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:29,298
你们家是可怕的大鬼屋
Is that Kanta?

247
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:30,967
勘太！
Hey, you in there!

248
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:34,554
勘太！
- Your house is haunted!    - Kanta!

249
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:38,683
Mmm.

250
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:41,477
爸爸以前也这样作弄过女生

Satsuki, I acted just like that when I was a boy.

253

不过　婆婆这个糯米团很好吃
Satsuki, I acted just like that when I was a boy.

254
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:51,404
那便多吃点啊
I hate boys, but I'm glad he brought this cake you made.

255
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,321
It's great, Granny.

爸爸，我们家　破破烂烂的会否倒下来

265
00:19:19,742 --> 00:19:22,557
要是才刚搬来就倒塌　那可怎么得了
Dad, this house is too old. I think it's gonna fall down.

266
00:19:22,557 --> 00:19:25,373
要是才刚搬来就倒塌　那可怎么得了
(LAUGHING)

267
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:28,668
That would be a problem, since we just moved in here.

00:23:24,445 --> 00:23:26,906
因为我好怕　妈妈会不喜欢那里
- See that, Mei?    - Mmm-hmm.

330
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:27,823
那妳们两个呢？

331
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:30,659
喜欢
Mei was worried that you wouldn't come home if the house was haunted.

332
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:31,410
妈妈我不怕鬼

333
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:32,953
- Do you two like it?    - Yeah!

334
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:34,934
小美的头发都是妳梳的？
I'm not scared at all.

335
00:23:34,934 --> 00:23:36,790
小美的头发都是妳梳的？
(LAUGHS)

336
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:39,877
梳得真好
Oh, what cute hair. Did you do this, Satsuki?

337
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,461
要好好谢姐姐啊！小美

338
00:23:40,002 --> 00:23:43,339
可是姐姐动不动就生气
- Mmm-hmm.    - It's very nice, huh, Mei?

339
00:23:43,339 --> 00:23:45,424
还不都是因为妳不乖
- What a lucky girl you are.    - Yeah, but she yells at me a lot.

340
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:47,509
小月，过来让妈妈看看
- What a lucky girl you are.    - Yeah, but she yells at me a lot.

341
00:23:47,217 --> 00:23:51,221
你的头发会不会太短了
- That's because you never sit still.    - Let's see your hair, Satsuki.

342
00:23:49,887 --> 00:23:51,013
我喜欢这个样子

343
00:23:51,055 --> 00:23:53,057
人家也要！人家也要！
You sure it isn't a little too short?

344
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:55,017
排队！
No, I like it this way, Mom.

345
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:56,581
头发还是一样经常打结
- Brush my hair! Brush mine!    - Wait your turn, Mei.

346
00:23:56,581 --> 00:23:59,021
就跟妈妈小时候一样
- Brush my hair! Brush mine!    - Wait your turn, Mei.

347
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,648
那我长大以后
Your hair will never cooperate.

348
00:24:00,814 --> 00:24:03,150
头发会不会　变得跟妈妈的一样呢？
It's exactly like my hair when I was your age.

349
00:24:03,317 --> 00:24:05,319
应该会吧
Do you think it will start cooperating soon?

350
00:24:05,027 --> 00:24:07,863
因为妳跟妈妈最像了
I want it to look like yours.

351

(CHUCKLES)

352
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:09,573
I think it will.

353
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:11,659
You and I are a lot alike, Satsuki.

354
00:24:19,667 --> 00:24:22,461
(INAUDIBLE)

355
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:27,383
妈妈好像好了很多

356
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:28,425
是啊

357
00:24:28,509 --> 00:24:32,096
医生也说　再过不久就可以出院了
- Mom looked great, didn't she, Dad?    - Yeah, she did,

358
00:24:31,762 --> 00:24:33,826
再过不久，明天吗？
her doctor said she should be able to come home real soon.

359
00:24:33,826 --> 00:24:35,891
妳什么都是明天
her doctor said she should be able to come home real soon.

360
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:38,644
明天可能有点难
- So she'll be home tomorrow?    - There she goes again with tomorrow.

361
00:24:38,644 --> 00:24:41,480
可是人家好想要跟妈妈一起睡
- So she'll be home tomorrow?    - There she goes again with tomorrow.

362
00:24:39,812 --> 00:24:41,689
Well, I think tomorrow might be a bit soon.

363
00:24:41,522 --> 00:24:45,526
妳不是说妳已经长大　要自己一个人睡的吗？
Mom said she was gonna sleep in my bed with me.

364
00:24:45,651 --> 00:24:48,320
跟妈妈睡没关系
I thought you weren't scared to sleep alone.

365
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:49,738
Can't you sleep by yourself?

366
00:24:49,863 --> 00:24:51,407
She's the one who's scared, not me.

- Sorry. I overslept again.    - I have to take lunch to school today.

Mei, sit down and eat.

383
00:25:49,465 --> 00:25:52,885

00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:23,635
刚才真的有大龙猫
(LAUGHING)

493
00:38:23,468 --> 00:38:27,555
我没有骗你们
Quit laughing! I really did see Totoro!

494
00:38:27,764 --> 00:38:29,057
I'm not lying.

495
00:38:29,224 --> 00:38:30,642
Mmm.

496
00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:36,397
小美啊

497
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:39,609
人家没有骗你们
Mei?

498
00:38:39,484 --> 00:38:41,194
其实爸爸跟姐姐
It's not a lie, Dad.

499
00:38:41,194 --> 00:38:42,904
也没有认为妳在骗人啊
It's not a lie, Dad.

500
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:43,947
Hmm. Don't worry, Mei.

501
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:47,367
小美刚才一定是　遇到了森林的主人
Satsuki and I believe you, and I bet you I know what happened.

502
00:38:47,242 --> 00:38:50,745
这就表示小美运气很好
You must have met one of the spirits of the forest.

503
00:38:49,661 --> 00:38:53,414
不过这种机会并不常有
That means you're a very lucky girl.

504
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:56,584
来，我们去跟它打个招呼吧
But you can't always see the spirits.

505
00:38:55,542 --> 00:38:57,961
打招呼？
You can only see them when they want you to.

506
00:38:57,669 --> 00:39:00,421
现在向大树出发了
Let's give the forest spirits a proper greeting.

507
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:03,466
- A greeting?    - Of course. Come on. Let's go.

508
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:19,419
小美好像变重了
(GASPS)

509
00:39:19,419 --> 00:39:21,234
爸爸，你看那樟树
(GASPS)

510
00:39:20,316 --> 00:39:22,735
Oh, Mei, you're getting heavy.

511
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:25,280
好大啊
Dad, there's that big camphor tree.

512
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:27,031
It's incredible.

513
00:39:31,578 --> 00:39:33,580
就是它！

514
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:36,144
是这棵吗？
That's it!

515
00:39:36,144 --> 00:39:38,668
爸爸，快来啊
That's it!

516
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:39,544
SATSUKI: That's Totoro's tree? MEI: Yeah!

517
00:39:39,711 --> 00:39:42,255
Come on, Dad! Can't you go any faster?

518
00:39:48,136 --> 00:39:51,014
那个洞不见了
Whoa.

519
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:53,016
真的是这里吗？

520
00:39:52,932 --> 00:39:56,019
小美她说洞不见了
Totoro's hole is gone.

521
00:39:54,851 --> 00:39:57,770
所以我说啦
- Are you sure it was here?    - Mmm-hmm.

522
00:39:57,103 --> 00:39:58,438
那不是想看　随时就能看到的

523
00:39:57,937 --> 00:40:00,023
还会再看得到吗？
Dad, she says the hole disappeared.

524
00:39:59,981 --> 00:40:02,734
我也好想看啊
Then right now, the forest spirits don't want to be seen.

525
00:40:02,483 --> 00:40:05,904
那得碰运气
But, Dad, I want to see them, too.

526
00:40:06,112 --> 00:40:08,406
这棵树真大啊
Maybe you will, if you're lucky.

527
00:40:09,449 --> 00:40:12,535
一定是从很久很久以前
Mmm. Magnificent tree.

528
00:40:12,619 --> 00:40:15,496
就已经长在这里的
It's been around since long ago,

529
00:40:15,538 --> 00:40:17,310
很久很久以前
back in the time when trees and people used to be friends.

530
00:40:17,310 --> 00:40:19,083
树木跟我们人的感情很好
back in the time when trees and people used to be friends.

531
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:22,462
爸爸就是因为看到这棵树

532
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:24,005
才会这么喜欢现在这个家的

533
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:28,426
而且知道　妈妈一定也会喜欢这里
When I saw this tree, I knew this would be a good place for our family to live.

534
00:40:27,592 --> 00:40:29,469
来，我们谢谢它再回家

535
00:40:28,593 --> 00:40:31,095
该吃饭了
And I think it will make your mother feel right at home.

536
00:40:31,012 --> 00:40:34,474
对了　我跟小满约好要到她家去
So, let's give this tree a nice greeting and go eat our lunch.

537
00:40:33,598 --> 00:40:35,099
人家也要去

538
00:40:34,641 --> 00:40:37,393
立正站好！
Then I want to write a letter to Mom and tell her all about this.

539
00:40:37,018 --> 00:40:39,082
多谢您照顾我们家小美
- I will, too!    - Attention!

540
00:40:39,082 --> 00:40:41,147
从今以后还盼您多多关照
- I will, too!    - Attention!

541
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:44,275
请您多多关照
Thank you for watching over Mei and making us feel so welcome here.

542
00:40:44,484 --> 00:40:46,465
我们比赛看谁先到家
ALL: Please continue to look after us.

543
00:40:46,465 --> 00:40:48,446
爸爸偷跑
ALL: Please continue to look after us.

544
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:51,407
等人家嘛
- Last one home's a rotten egg!    - Hey, no fair!

545
00:40:51,616 --> 00:40:53,326
小美，快点
MEI: Wait!

546
00:40:53,326 --> 00:40:55,036
等人家嘛
MEI: Wait!

547
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:57,246
- Uh!    - SATSUKI: Hurry it up!

548
00:40:57,413 --> 00:41:01,042
妈妈，今天出了一件大新闻
Wait for me!

549
00:41:01,084 --> 00:41:04,921
因为小美说她看到了　一只很大的龙猫精灵
SATSUKI: Dear Mom: We had an exciting day today.

550
00:41:05,088 --> 00:41:09,467
Mei met a big forest spirit called Totoro.

551
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:16,057
我好希望我也能够见它一面
I hope I'll be able to see him someday, too.

552
00:41:40,832 --> 00:41:42,166
(INAUDIBLE)

553
00:41:44,419 --> 00:41:45,503
勘太

554
00:41:45,545 --> 00:41:51,384
再不快点就要迟到了　嗯
WOMAN: Kanta, hurry up, or you'll be late for school.

555
00:41:51,551 --> 00:41:52,510
Yeah.

556
00:41:52,635 --> 00:41:54,012
(CHILDREN LAUGHING)

557
00:42:28,838 --> 00:42:32,592
小美
Oh.

558
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:33,676
老师

559
00:42:34,427 --> 00:42:36,491
什么事？小月
Mei?

560
00:42:36,491 --> 00:42:38,556
我妹妹⋯
Mei?

561
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:38,222
Miss Hara!

562
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:39,766
Yes, Satsuki?

563
00:42:39,515 --> 00:42:42,560
你们看，你们看，她妹妹
Uh, my sister's here.

564
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:43,227
CHILDREN: Her sister?

565
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:46,564
婆婆、小美？
(CLAMORING)

566
00:42:46,647 --> 00:42:48,441
对不起

567
00:42:48,524 --> 00:42:50,609
她一直吵着　要到姐姐那边去所以⋯
- Granny, what's wrong?    - I don't know.

568
00:42:50,609 --> 00:42:52,695
可是
- Granny, what's wrong?    - I don't know.

569
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,405
小美
She said she wouldn't stop crying unless I brought her to you.

570
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:56,491
今天是爸爸　要到大学去教课的日子
She said she wouldn't stop crying unless I brought her to you.

571
00:42:55,907 --> 00:42:58,701
我们不是说好了
She said that? Mei, be reasonable.

572
00:42:58,534 --> 00:43:00,828
你要在婆婆家　乖乖等姊姊放学的吗？
You know you had to stay with Granny.

573
00:43:00,953 --> 00:43:04,540
姊姊还要再上两个小时的课
I have school and Dad's teaching at the university.

574
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:07,626
婆婆的田里又那么忙
I only have two more hours of school to go.

575
00:43:07,626 --> 00:43:10,671
小美在婆婆的家里一直都很乖的
I only have two more hours of school to go.

576
00:43:08,544 --> 00:43:11,047
Can't you just stay with Granny until then?

577
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:14,342
She's been so good up till now. Weren't you, Mei?

578
00:43:19,514 --> 00:43:22,767
婆婆，那我去跟老师说说看
(SIGHS)

579
00:43:22,975 --> 00:43:25,853
Well, I'll talk to my teacher and see what we can do.

580
00:43:27,563 --> 00:43:30,024
现在小月因为妈妈住院
(LAUGHING)

581
00:43:30,024 --> 00:43:32,485
所以妹妹暂时没人照顾
(LAUGHING)

582
00:43:31,734 --> 00:43:34,570
同学们要好好跟她相处啊
Satsuki's mom is in the hospital,

583
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:37,240
好、好
so her sister Mei is going to stay with us today, okay, class?

584
00:43:37,406 --> 00:43:43,538
这是什么啊
- Let's make her feel welcome.    - ALL: Yes, ma'am.

585
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:45,540
大龙猫呀

586
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:49,544
不要吵
- What are you drawing, Mei?    - It's a big Totoro.

587
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:52,588
Shh. Mei, try to keep quiet, will you?

588
00:43:52,713 --> 00:43:55,049
Mmm-hmm.

我今天不能去社团了
CHILDREN: Bye, Mei!

593
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:06,894
我去跟老师说

拜拜，再见
I have to skip our club meeting, Michiko.

I'll let everyone know. Bye!

Hurry up, Mei. It's gonna rain.

00:44:15,945 --> 00:44:17,071
Okay.

599
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:21,909
下雨了

00:44:38,843 --> 00:44:42,597
人家都没有哭，棒不棒？　嗯
Come on.

603
00:44:43,347 --> 00:44:45,766
可是真伤脑筋
I didn't even cry. That's good, huh?

604
00:44:45,766 --> 00:44:48,186
可是真伤脑筋
Hmm.

605
00:44:48,352 --> 00:44:52,523
土地公爷爷　请您让我们躲一下雨
Yeah, but we're not home yet.

606
00:44:52,815 --> 00:44:56,152
We'd like to share your roof for a while, sir, if you don't mind.

607

- Mmm.    - Huh?

可是⋯
- Don't you…    - Mmm. Mmm!

Mmm!

00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:42,907
Hey!

611
00:45:57,588 --> 00:45:59,674
姊姊，有伞子真棒啊

612
00:46:00,591 --> 00:46:04,011
可是伞子顶破了一个大洞
- That was lucky, wasn't it?    - Mmm-hmm.

613
00:46:05,930 --> 00:46:08,808

(CLOCK CHIMING)

616
00:46:19,068 --> 00:46:20,111
Dad left his umbrella here.

不就是忘记了
- I'd better take it to him.    - I wanna go, too.

00:46:25,491 --> 00:46:27,618
竟然还会傻得忘了带伞　你骗鬼啊！
What? I left it.

What kind of fool forgets his umbrella at school when it's raining?

00:46:31,664 --> 00:46:34,667
才不是呢
- Hey!    - I bet you were swinging it around

623
00:46:34,875 --> 00:46:35,835
and you broke it.

Thanks for watching Mei today.

Sorry we couldn't keep her happy.

不过却害勘太都淋湿了
What? He lent you this? Oh, my. Look how beat up it is.

不必客气
So, it was really nice of him to help us out. Tell him thank you.

00:47:14,206 --> 00:47:15,708

So, it was really nice of him to help us out. Tell him thank you.

- He must have been drenched.    - That's okay.

01:04:38,792 --> 01:04:42,796
发电处七国山医院
Mmm-hmm.

813
01:04:42,879 --> 01:04:44,839
七国山医院送来的
“Please contact Shichikokuyama.”

814
01:04:44,839 --> 01:04:46,799
那就是从妈妈的医院
“Please contact Shichikokuyama.”

815
01:04:46,799 --> 01:04:48,760
难道妈妈发生了什么事
“Please contact Shichikokuyama.”

816
01:04:47,258 --> 01:04:50,678
Shichikokuyama! It's from Mom's hospital!

817
01:04:50,637 --> 01:04:51,867
婆婆，怎么办？
Something must have happened to her.

818
01:04:51,867 --> 01:04:53,098
医院要我们跟他们联络
Something must have happened to her.

819
01:04:52,847 --> 01:04:54,682
你别紧张，冷静一点

820
01:04:54,474 --> 01:04:56,935
知不知道爸爸上班的地方？
We have to get to the hospital right away, Granny.

821
01:04:56,768 --> 01:04:58,728
爸爸研究室的电话号码　我是知道
Okay. Calm down. First, we need to get in touch with your father.

822
01:04:58,728 --> 01:05:00,688
可是没有电话可打呀
Okay. Calm down. First, we need to get in touch with your father.

823
01:04:59,854 --> 01:05:04,859
勘太　你带小月去打电话
I know his phone number at the university, but we don't have a phone.

824
01:05:04,526 --> 01:05:08,363
Kanta, take Satsuki to your uncle's house and let her use the phone.

825
01:05:08,530 --> 01:05:12,742
小美妳留下来陪婆婆
Mmm-hmm.

826
01:05:14,035 --> 01:05:17,288
Mei, you need to stay here with me!

827
01:05:21,709 --> 01:05:28,550
小美妳回去婆婆那里
Mei, go back and stay with Granny!

828
01:06:00,874 --> 01:06:03,835
请你接市外电话

829
01:06:04,711 --> 01:06:08,965
请接东京31局1382号
Hello? I'd like to place a long-distance call, please.

830
01:06:08,715 --> 01:06:12,719
好
It's to my dad at Tokyo 31-13-82.

831
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:14,846
这个女孩还真是讨人喜欢呢
Right.

832
01:06:15,263 --> 01:06:19,601
喂！是的
Now, that's a nice girl, eh, Kanta?

833
01:06:19,601 --> 01:06:20,643
(RINGS)

834
01:06:19,767 --> 01:06:22,604
请问是考古学教室吗？
Hello?

835
01:06:22,061 --> 01:06:23,438
Yes.

836
01:06:22,687 --> 01:06:25,273
我爸爸⋯　麻烦请草壁先生听电话
Hello? I need to speak to my dad in the archaeology department.

837
01:06:25,273 --> 01:06:27,859
我叫做草壁月
Hello? I need to speak to my dad in the archaeology department.

838
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:29,903
I mean, I need to speak to Mr. Kusakabe.

839
01:06:30,069 --> 01:06:33,781
爸爸，是我，小月
My name is Satsuki Kusakabe.

840
01:06:33,823 --> 01:06:38,036
怎么了？
Hello, Dad? Is that you? It's Satsuki.

841
01:06:38,203 --> 01:06:40,788
医院来电报？我知道了
- Satsuki, what's wrong?    - We got a telegram.

842
01:06:40,371 --> 01:06:42,707
爸爸现在就　打电话到医院去问
You're supposed to call Mom's doctor at the hospital.

843
01:06:42,790 --> 01:06:44,626
是不是妈妈出事了
What? The hospital?

844
01:06:44,626 --> 01:06:45,752
怎么办呀？爸爸
Okay. I'll call them right away.

845
01:06:45,752 --> 01:06:46,878
不会有事的
Okay. I'll call them right away.

846
01:06:46,836 --> 01:06:49,797
爸爸给医院打过电话　就马上就回妳电话
Did something happen to her, Dad? Do you think she's okay?

847
01:06:49,881 --> 01:06:52,717
你在那边等一下
Let's not worry.

848
01:06:51,674 --> 01:06:54,844
I'll call the hospital, and then I'll call you right back. Okay?

849
01:06:53,718 --> 01:06:56,679
待会儿就打给妳
- Yeah.    - Just wait by the phone.

850
01:06:56,679 --> 01:06:59,807
婆婆　我还可以在这里待一会吗？
- Mmm-hmm.    - I need to hang up now. Okay?

851
01:06:59,849 --> 01:07:01,726
我爸爸还会打电话来

852
01:07:01,768 --> 01:07:05,688
没关系，慢慢来
Excuse me, is it okay if I wait here? My dad says he's going to call me back.

853
01:07:05,813 --> 01:07:08,441
Of course. Make yourself at home.

854
01:07:11,653 --> 01:07:17,951
姊姊
Satsuki!

855
01:07:18,117 --> 01:07:19,244
(PANTING)

856
01:07:21,704 --> 01:07:24,186
不可以啦
(BLEATING)

857
01:07:24,186 --> 01:07:26,668
这个是要给妈妈的粟米
(BLEATING)

858
01:07:26,417 --> 01:07:28,503
不可以！
Back off! Don't touch my corn!

859
01:07:27,877 --> 01:07:29,462
这个是要给妈妈的啦
It's for my mommy!

860
01:07:29,462 --> 01:07:31,047
这个是要给妈妈的啦
(BLEATING)

861
01:07:31,214 --> 01:07:34,717
Too bad! She needs it to make her better.

862
01:07:35,510 --> 01:07:36,844
(BLEATING)

863
01:07:45,895 --> 01:07:46,854
小美

864
01:07:47,605 --> 01:07:49,691
爸爸说妈妈的病又有点恶化了

865
01:07:49,774 --> 01:07:53,486
所以这个礼拜妈妈不能回家了
Mei, the doctor said that Mom's not doing well.

866
01:07:52,819 --> 01:07:54,758
我不要！
So she doesn't get to come home this weekend.

867
01:07:54,758 --> 01:07:56,698
你不要也不行啊
So she doesn't get to come home this weekend.

868
01:07:56,197 --> 01:07:59,325
妈妈要是勉强出院　反而更严重了那怎么办
No fair!

869
01:07:59,534 --> 01:08:00,827
我不要！
It can't be helped, Mei.

870
01:08:00,952 --> 01:08:03,037
不过是晚几天而已
What if she came home early, and it made her even worse?

871
01:08:03,037 --> 01:08:05,123
不过是晚几天而已
It's not fair!

872
01:08:04,706 --> 01:08:05,915
我不要！

873
01:08:06,291 --> 01:08:09,711
那妈妈死掉　也没有关系是不是
Mei, we just have to wait a little longer.

874
01:08:08,626 --> 01:08:10,774
不要！
- No!    - You want her to die, Mei?

875
01:08:10,774 --> 01:08:12,922
妳这个大笨蛋！
- No!    - You want her to die, Mei?

876
01:08:12,964 --> 01:08:16,009
我不管妳了！
- Is that what you want?    - No!

877
01:08:16,217 --> 01:08:18,845
You're such a baby! Just grow up!

878
01:08:23,891 --> 01:08:27,687
走吧
(SNIFFLING)

879
01:08:29,856 --> 01:08:32,254
姊姊大坏蛋！
Come on, Mei.

880
01:08:32,254 --> 01:08:34,652
姊姊大坏蛋！
(CRYING)

881
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:37,822
She's so mean!

882
01:08:38,323 --> 01:08:41,284
(CRYING)

883
01:09:00,678 --> 01:09:01,721
衣服该收收了

884
01:09:01,763 --> 01:09:04,724
别这么沮丧

885
01:09:04,641 --> 01:09:08,102
婆婆不是过来帮忙了吗
Come on, girls. Let's put the laundry away.

886
01:09:07,685 --> 01:09:12,231
打起精神
Oh, don't be sad. Granny's here to help.

887
01:09:15,860 --> 01:09:19,906
你爸爸说他今天　要留在医院过夜

888
01:09:19,906 --> 01:09:23,785
妳妈妈不过是感冒而已
Don't worry. Your father is going to stop by the hospital.

889
01:09:23,701 --> 01:09:27,955
下个星期六一定会回来的
The doctors say your mom just has a cold.

890
01:09:28,122 --> 01:09:32,919
之前也是这样
She should be home next Saturday.

891
01:09:33,669 --> 01:09:35,880
医生说只要住数天就会好了

892
01:09:35,672 --> 01:09:38,758
而且那次也是说得了感冒
This is just like last time.

893
01:09:37,548 --> 01:09:41,886
我妈妈要是死了该怎么办
They said Mom just had a little cold, she'd be home in a few days.

894
01:09:42,678 --> 01:09:43,805
小月

895
01:09:43,388 --> 01:09:45,577
我妈妈要是死了那我们⋯
Granny, what will we do if she dies?

896
01:09:45,577 --> 01:09:47,767
我妈妈要是死了那我们⋯
Satsuki!

897
01:09:48,101 --> 01:09:50,186
Maybe she's dead already.

898
01:09:49,727 --> 01:09:53,606
妳放心，不要乱想
(CRYING)

899
01:09:52,772 --> 01:09:57,652
妳妈妈哪舍得下　妳们这些可爱的孩子
Now, don't say that, sweetheart.

900
01:09:57,402 --> 01:10:01,698
别哭了别哭了
How could she ever leave such sweet girls like you?

901
01:10:01,697 --> 01:10:04,117
在妳爸爸回来之前
Oh, don't cry.

902
01:10:03,658 --> 01:10:06,452
婆婆都会陪着妳的　好不好呀
Don't cry. It's all right.

903
01:10:06,619 --> 01:10:10,123
I'll stay here until your father comes home. Okay? Okay?

904
01:10:47,827 --> 01:10:55,001
小美呀
Mei!

905
01:10:55,668 --> 01:10:57,879
小美

906
01:10:59,922 --> 01:11:02,884
小美
Mei!

907
01:11:04,635 --> 01:11:06,762
小美回来了没？
Mei!

908
01:11:06,846 --> 01:11:09,724
没在公车站牌那边吗？

909
01:11:09,515 --> 01:11:11,851
这就奇怪了
- Did she come back?    - No.

910
01:11:11,768 --> 01:11:14,896
她会跑到哪里去了？
- She wasn't at the bus stop?    - No.

911
01:11:13,895 --> 01:11:15,938
我刚刚跟小美吵了一架
Let's think.

912
01:11:15,855 --> 01:11:18,274
因为她⋯
Do you know anywhere else she might have gone?

913
01:11:17,815 --> 01:11:22,111
她会不会　跑去妈妈住的医院了
I yelled at her this morning. She wanted Mom to come home.

914
01:11:20,818 --> 01:11:23,779
七国山医院去了呀
Granny, I bet she went to see Mom at the hospital!

915
01:11:23,779 --> 01:11:26,741
可是就连大人也得　走上三个钟头才会到
Granny, I bet she went to see Mom at the hospital!

916
01:11:25,406 --> 01:11:27,575
You think she'd try to walk to the hospital?

917
01:11:26,824 --> 01:11:30,745
我去看看
Why, that's a three-hour walk even for grown-ups.

918
01:11:29,660 --> 01:11:33,748
勘太　快点去叫你爸爸回来
I'll go look.

919
01:11:33,789 --> 01:11:37,502
小美不见了
Kanta! Hurry! Run on home and get your father!

920
01:11:37,627 --> 01:11:40,546
Mei's disappeared, and we need all the help we can get!

921
01:11:44,967 --> 01:11:52,558
小美真是笨蛋　不知道路又爱乱跑
I shouldn't have yelled at her. This is all my fault.

922
01:11:55,811 --> 01:12:02,693
小美
Mei!

923
01:12:05,071 --> 01:12:08,032
打搅了，伯伯，请问⋯

924
01:12:08,783 --> 01:12:11,911
您有没有看见束辫子的小女孩　从这条路经过
Excuse me, mister! Hello!

925
01:12:11,786 --> 01:12:13,850
她是我妹妹
- Yeah?    - I'm looking for my sister.

926
01:12:13,850 --> 01:12:15,915
这个嘛⋯小女孩啊
- Yeah?    - I'm looking for my sister.

927
01:12:15,039 --> 01:12:17,792
没什么印象
Did you happen to see a little girl pass this way?

928
01:12:17,792 --> 01:12:20,545
没什么印象
Let's see. Uh, a little girl?

929
01:12:19,835 --> 01:12:24,298
她会不会没往这边来
Mmm, I don't think so. I would have noticed.

930
01:12:24,423 --> 01:12:25,842
I'll try the other road.

931
01:12:41,148 --> 01:12:43,109
妳确定她是往这边来的？

932
01:12:43,192 --> 01:12:47,488
我也不知道
MAN: Are you sure that this is the way she came?

933
01:12:47,655 --> 01:12:49,156
I don't know.

934
01:12:53,536 --> 01:13:00,084
小美
Mei!

935
01:13:01,002 --> 01:13:03,588
(HEAVY BREATHING)

936
01:13:16,225 --> 01:13:18,769
停车！
(CAR APPROACHING)

937
01:13:21,022 --> 01:13:22,398
搞什么啊！危险啊
Stop! Please, stop!

938
01:13:22,398 --> 01:13:23,774
我在找我妹妹
Stop! Please, stop!

939
01:13:23,858 --> 01:13:25,860
你们有没有看一个小女孩

940
01:13:25,484 --> 01:13:27,862
妳妹妹？
- Oh! Are you crazy?    - I'm looking for my little sister.

941
01:13:27,737 --> 01:13:30,698
她好像是往七国山医院去了
Have you seen a girl walking this way?

942
01:13:29,697 --> 01:13:31,824
她是一个四岁的小女孩
Is she lost?

943
01:13:31,782 --> 01:13:34,264
良子啊，妳刚才有没有看到
I think she's trying to walk to the hospital. She's only four years old.

944
01:13:34,264 --> 01:13:36,746
我们两个　就是从那个方向来的
I think she's trying to walk to the hospital. She's only four years old.

945
01:13:36,078 --> 01:13:39,707
不过　好像没有看到那样的小孩
Oh. I didn't see her. Did you?

946
01:13:38,706 --> 01:13:41,917
谢谢你们
No. We just came from the hospital,

947
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:44,462
她从哪里来的？
and there was no sign of a little girl on the road.

948
01:13:44,629 --> 01:13:45,796
松乡
Okay. Thanks.

949
01:13:45,796 --> 01:13:46,964
松乡！？
Okay. Thanks.

950
01:13:47,089 --> 01:13:49,800
会不会搞错了呀
- Wait. Where'd you say you're from?    - From Matsugo.

951
01:13:49,842 --> 01:13:52,094
就是啊
Matsugo! Ho!

952
01:13:52,094 --> 01:13:54,347
就是啊
A four-year-old couldn't walk this far.

953
01:13:54,472 --> 01:13:55,431
(ENGINE STARTS)

954
01:13:55,598 --> 01:13:57,391
MAN: Good luck. I hope you find her.

955
01:14:03,314 --> 01:14:05,232
小月

956
01:14:06,359 --> 01:14:09,153
勘太
Satsuki!

957
01:14:09,737 --> 01:14:10,529
怎么样？

958
01:14:10,696 --> 01:14:13,115
没看到，那妳呢？
Kanta!

959
01:14:12,823 --> 01:14:14,825
现在我爸爸他们也去找了
- Find her?    - No.

960
01:14:14,825 --> 01:14:17,578
我去往七国山的路上看看
- I guess you didn't, either.    - Mmm-mmm.

961
01:14:17,244 --> 01:14:19,580
妳先回家去
My dad's got a bunch of people looking for her.

962
01:14:19,288 --> 01:14:20,831
我想小美一定是想去医院
I could ride my bike to the hospital for you.

963
01:14:20,831 --> 01:14:22,375
可是却走错路了
I could ride my bike to the hospital for you.

964
01:14:22,208 --> 01:14:24,502
一定是
- You should go back home.    - Check all around.

965
01:14:24,502 --> 01:14:26,796
刚才有人在神池　发现一只小孩的凉鞋
- You should go back home.    - Check all around.

966
01:14:24,585 --> 01:14:27,797
I'm sure that Mei got lost on her way to the hospital, okay?

967
01:14:27,964 --> 01:14:30,758
A little while ago, they found a sandal in the pond.

968
01:14:33,719 --> 01:14:36,555
不过还不确定　那就是小美的鞋子
(GASPS)

969
01:14:37,890 --> 01:14:40,851
They don't know for sure it's Mei's sandal!

970
01:14:51,654 --> 01:14:54,949
找到了吗？
(BREATHING HARD)

971
01:14:57,660 --> 01:14:59,328
Did you find her yet?

972
01:15:23,477 --> 01:15:24,895
MAN: We'll check the irrigation ditch.

喃呒阿弥陀佛
MAN: On the far end.

975
01:15:30,943 --> 01:15:35,239
池那边泥比较深一点　从那边开始啊
(CHANTING)

976
01:15:34,780 --> 01:15:38,701
递根竹竿给我！
It's much deeper over there. You should try there first!

977
01:15:38,868 --> 01:15:40,327
MAN: Are there more poles?

978
01:15:44,707 --> 01:15:49,670

980
01:15:50,921 --> 01:15:53,799
婆婆
Huh?

981
01:15:53,549 --> 01:15:56,886
妳看看这个
WOMAN: It's Satsuki.

982
01:15:58,637 --> 01:16:00,723
Here. Is this Mei's?

983
01:16:05,686 --> 01:16:12,818
不是小美的
- It's not hers.    - Oh!

984
01:16:12,943 --> 01:16:14,820
(SIGHS)

985
01:16:16,989 --> 01:16:18,365
太好了
Ohh…

986
01:16:18,365 --> 01:16:19,742
太好了
(SIGHS)

987
01:16:19,784 --> 01:16:23,245
我还以　这是小美的
Oh, thank goodness.

988
01:16:22,912 --> 01:16:25,414
婆婆就爱穷紧张
I was positively certain that sandal belonged to Mei.

989
01:16:25,414 --> 01:16:27,917
虚惊一场啊
I was positively certain that sandal belonged to Mei.

990
01:16:27,291 --> 01:16:29,752
那孩子到底跑到哪去了？
All right. Granny just got carried away.

991
01:16:29,418 --> 01:16:31,107
再去四处找找
Hey! It's not her sandal!

992
01:16:31,107 --> 01:16:32,797
快点啊，天要黑了
Hey! It's not her sandal!

993
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:34,757
不好意思啊

994
01:16:34,799 --> 01:16:40,262
大家辛苦你们　再回头去找找好了
All right everyone, I know you've spent a lot of time here already,

995
01:16:40,429 --> 01:16:42,348
but we still need your help.

996
01:17:06,789 --> 01:17:07,957
求求你们

997
01:17:07,998 --> 01:17:10,126
把我带去龙猫那里
Please.

998
01:17:09,875 --> 01:17:12,461
我的妹妹走丢了
(PANTING)

999
01:17:11,836 --> 01:17:13,900
不久天就要黑了
Let me in to see Totoro. Mei's lost.

1000
01:17:13,900 --> 01:17:15,965
她一定在哪里迷了路
Let me in to see Totoro. Mei's lost.

1001
01:17:15,005 --> 01:17:17,508
It's getting dark, and she's out there all alone.

1002
01:17:17,675 --> 01:17:20,052

我妹妹小美走失了
Totoro!

1008
01:17:52,751 --> 01:17:53,919
我找了好久都找不到

1009
01:17:53,961 --> 01:17:57,360
求求你，帮我找小美好不好
Totoro, Mei's lost. I looked everywhere for her, but I couldn't find her.

1010
01:17:57,360 --> 01:18:00,759
她一定已经吓哭了
Totoro, Mei's lost. I looked everywhere for her, but I couldn't find her.

1011
01:17:58,424 --> 01:18:01,135
Please help me. I have to find her.

1012
01:18:00,885 --> 01:18:05,097
我现在不知道该怎么办好
I'm sure she's scared half to death by now.

1013
01:18:05,264 --> 01:18:07,141

大家都看不到它

No one else can see it, can they?

1017
01:20:15,728 --> 01:20:19,773
小美

1018

妳这个傻瓜
- Mei!    - Satsuki!

1030
01:21:30,302 --> 01:21:32,304
对不起

1031
01:21:32,513 --> 01:21:37,768
妳是不是想要把粟米　送去医院给妈妈？
- Oh! You're okay.    - I'm sorry.

1032
01:21:38,352 --> 01:21:41,355
Were you trying to take your corn to Mom at the hospital?

1033
01:21:41,522 --> 01:21:42,815
Mmm-hmm.

你要送我们去医院吗？

谢谢你
You're going to take us to the hospital?

1037
01:21:58,622 --> 01:21:59,706
Thank you!

01:21:59,873 --> 01:22:01,667
(LAUGHING)

1039
01:22:04,795 --> 01:22:06,964
对不起，只不过是感冒

1040
01:22:07,047 --> 01:22:09,528
医院就擅自决定　发电报给家里了
I'm sorry. I don't know why the hospital sent a telegram.

1041
01:22:09,528 --> 01:22:12,010
那两个孩子一定都很担心我吧
I'm sorry. I don't know why the hospital sent a telegram.

1042
01:22:12,094 --> 01:22:14,054
真是苦了她们了
It's just a cold.

1043
01:22:14,012 --> 01:22:16,473
她们知道你平安就会安心的
I hope it didn't upset the girls too much. I've caused them enough grief already.

1044
01:22:16,473 --> 01:22:18,934
这些年来我们一家四口
I hope it didn't upset the girls too much. I've caused them enough grief already.

1045
01:22:18,934 --> 01:22:20,894
不都这样努力过来的吗？
When they see you're all right, they'll be fine.

1046
01:22:20,894 --> 01:22:22,855
享福之前总得吃点苦啊
When they see you're all right, they'll be fine.

1047
01:22:21,687 --> 01:22:24,523
We'll just wait a little longer for a weekend together.

1048
01:22:23,856 --> 01:22:28,068
她们表面好像没事　可是心里一定很难过
Don't worry. We've made it this far.

1049
01:22:27,776 --> 01:22:31,447
小月越是懂事　就越教人于心不忍
The girls act so strong, but I think it's been harder than they let on.

1050
01:22:31,613 --> 01:22:33,031
是啊
Especially Satsuki.

1051
01:22:32,906 --> 01:22:35,471
出院以后我一定要好好疼她们
- She tries to act so adult.    - That's true.

1052
01:22:35,471 --> 01:22:38,036
让她们尽情耍耍小脾气
- She tries to act so adult.    - That's true.

1053
01:22:37,619 --> 01:22:39,079
I can't wait until I get better.

1054
01:22:39,246 --> 01:22:41,957
When I get home, I'm going to spoil those girls rotten.

Look at Mom. She's laughing.

- Everything must be okay.    - Yeah.

01:22:58,390 --> 01:23:00,976
我得赶快把身体养好才行

1060
01:23:01,059 --> 01:23:04,980
是啊
I'm going to hurry up and get well!

是谁摆的啊？

1063
01:23:13,780 --> 01:23:16,283
怎么啦？
Who left this?

1064
01:23:15,741 --> 01:23:17,576
我好像看到小月和小美坐在那棵松树上笑
(GASPS)

1065
01:23:17,576 --> 01:23:19,411
我好像看到小月和小美坐在那棵松树上笑
What is it?

1066
01:23:19,786 --> 01:23:23,790
搞不好是真的也说不定啊
I thought I saw Satsuki and Mei smiling at us from up in that tree.

1067
01:23:23,874 --> 01:23:25,000
妳看

1068
01:23:25,042 --> 01:23:28,045
〝送给妈妈〞
It sounds crazy, but maybe you did.
