00:14:02,663 --> 00:14:06,262
现在这时田里农事很忙碌呢
GRANNY: We've been busy in the rice fields,

166
00:14:04,915 --> 00:14:09,378
不过我还是偶尔会来打扫
but I did manage to keep the place well-dusted, as you can see.

167
00:14:09,432 --> 00:14:11,073
小美，妳手怎么脏兮兮的？
Mei, your hands are filthy. What on earth did you do?

168
00:14:11,073 --> 00:14:12,714
怎么弄的？
Mei, your hands are filthy. What on earth did you do?

169
00:14:12,881 --> 00:14:15,229
灰尘精灵跑掉了
I caught a soot gremlin, but he got away.

170
00:14:14,841 --> 00:14:17,315
妳看妳的脚
Ahh! Your feet!

171
00:14:20,806 --> 00:14:21,765
(GASPS)

172
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:24,197
我的脚也脏兮兮的
Mine are black, too!

173
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:29,243
哎呀呀！
Ah…

174
00:14:31,566 --> 00:14:34,444
看样子是煤煤虫在作怪
You've got soot sprites in your house.

175
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:35,416
煤煤虫？

176
00:14:34,611 --> 00:14:37,781
你说的煤煤虫是不是会
Soot sprites? The black puff balls? About this big?

177
00:14:37,948 --> 00:14:41,214
〝哇啦哇啦〞的乱跑啊
They scurry everywhere when you enter a room?

178
00:14:40,242 --> 00:14:42,298
是啊
That's right.

179
00:14:42,035 --> 00:14:45,343
它们专门跑到没人住的旧房子里
They live in old, empty houses

180
00:14:45,205 --> 00:14:49,876
然后弄得满屋子的灰尘和煤灰
and run all over the place, covering everything with dirt.

181
00:14:50,043 --> 00:14:53,547
我小时候也有看过
I used to be able to see them when I was your age.

182
00:14:53,714 --> 00:14:57,397
想不到妳们也看到
So you've seen them, too. That's very interesting.

183
00:14:57,384 --> 00:14:59,803
婆婆，它们是妖怪吗？
So they're a kind of ghost, then?

184
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:04,195
其实也没什么好怕的
Don't worry, dear. They're nothing to be afraid of.

185
00:15:03,724 --> 00:15:07,281
只要对它们笑笑　它们就不会害人
If they decide you're nice people, they won't harm you,

186
00:15:07,269 --> 00:15:10,326
住上一阵子之后　它们自然就会不见
and after a while, they'll just go away.

187
00:15:09,771 --> 00:15:11,523
I bet they're up in the rafters right now,

188
00:15:11,202 --> 00:15:16,111
说不定它们已经在天花板上　讨论该搬去哪里了
having a talk about whether or not they should move out.

(JABBERING)

190
00:15:20,699 --> 00:15:23,910
小美，它们很快就会不见了
- Hear that, Mei? They're gonna move out.    - I don't want them to leave.

191
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:24,257
不好玩

192
00:15:24,077 --> 00:15:26,788
可是要是来这么一大堆　该怎么办？
What if a huge one came chasing after you?

193
00:15:26,913 --> 00:15:28,344
人家才不怕那些
So what? I'm not afraid.

194
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:30,450
是吗？
Right. Then you can go to the bathroom

195
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:32,473
那以后晚上　姐姐就不陪妳上厕所
Right. Then you can go to the bathroom

196
00:15:30,834 --> 00:15:32,336
by yourself in the middle of the night.

199
00:15:35,756 --> 00:15:39,397
妳们去河边打点水回来吧
Let's get to work. Who'd like to fetch some water for the pump?

200
00:15:39,468 --> 00:15:40,677
河边啊
I'll go get it.

201
00:15:40,844 --> 00:15:42,262

Granny, the pump's working!

208
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:15,266
好好打啊
Keep pumping!

209
00:16:15,128 --> 00:16:17,477
打到水变凉为止
Don't stop until the water gets cold.

210
00:16:17,506 --> 00:16:19,257
好
Okay.

Oh. Hello again. Can I help you?

213
00:17:04,219 --> 00:17:08,444
我妈妈要给婆婆的
Eh… My… mom said to give this to Granny.

Oh. What is it?

是勘太吗？
Is that Kanta?

I hate boys, but I'm glad he brought this cake you made.

01:07:26,793 --> 01:07:28,732
不可以！
Too bad! She needs it to make her better.

782
01:07:28,732 --> 01:07:30,672
这个是要给妈妈的啦
Too bad! She needs it to make her better.

784
01:07:45,895 --> 01:07:47,793
小美
Mei, the doctor said that Mom's not doing well.

785
01:07:47,793 --> 01:07:49,691
爸爸说妈妈的病又有点恶化了
Mei, the doctor said that Mom's not doing well.

786
01:07:49,553 --> 01:07:52,735
所以这个礼拜妈妈不能回家了
So she doesn't get to come home this weekend.

787
01:07:52,097 --> 01:07:55,225
我不要！
No fair!

788
01:07:54,904 --> 01:07:56,698
你不要也不行啊
It can't be helped, Mei.

789
01:07:56,739 --> 01:07:58,937
妈妈要是勉强出院　反而更严重了那怎么办
What if she came home early, and it made her even worse?

790
01:07:59,104 --> 01:08:01,023
我不要！
It's not fair!

791
01:08:01,828 --> 01:08:04,664
不过是晚几天而已
Mei, we just have to wait a little longer.

792
01:08:04,526 --> 01:08:07,118
我不要！
- No!    - You want her to die, Mei?

793
01:08:07,118 --> 01:08:09,711
那妈妈死掉　也没有关系是不是
- No!    - You want her to die, Mei?

794
01:08:08,864 --> 01:08:11,909
不要！
- Is that what you want?    - No!

795
01:08:11,879 --> 01:08:13,380
妳这个大笨蛋！
You're such a baby! Just grow up!

796
01:08:13,380 --> 01:08:14,882
我不管妳了！
You're such a baby! Just grow up!

797
01:08:25,643 --> 01:08:27,687
走吧
Come on, Mei.

798
01:08:27,508 --> 01:08:30,093

799
01:08:29,897 --> 01:08:34,652

01:09:02,632 --> 01:09:04,724
别这么沮丧
Come on, girls. Let's put the laundry away.

803
01:09:04,586 --> 01:09:08,131
婆婆不是过来帮忙了吗
Oh, don't be sad. Granny's here to help.

804
01:09:07,685 --> 01:09:10,897
打起精神

805
01:09:15,806 --> 01:09:19,906
你爸爸说他今天　要留在医院过夜
Don't worry. Your father is going to stop by the hospital.

806
01:09:20,656 --> 01:09:23,855
妳妈妈不过是感冒而已
The doctors say your mom just has a cold.

807
01:09:23,701 --> 01:09:27,526
下个星期六一定会回来的
She should be home next Saturday.

808
01:09:31,572 --> 01:09:33,323
之前也是这样
This is just like last time.

809
01:09:33,448 --> 01:09:37,578
医生说只要住数天就会好了
They said Mom just had a little cold, she'd be home in a few days.

810
01:09:36,631 --> 01:09:38,758
而且那次也是说得了感冒

811
01:09:38,925 --> 01:09:41,886
我妈妈要是死了该怎么办
Granny, what will we do if she dies?

812

小月
Satsuki!

813
01:09:43,888 --> 01:09:46,808
我妈妈要是死了那我们⋯
Maybe she's dead already.

(CRYING)

815
01:09:49,727 --> 01:09:52,801
妳放心，不要乱想
Now, don't say that, sweetheart.

816
01:09:52,772 --> 01:09:57,652
妳妈妈哪舍得下　妳们这些可爱的孩子
How could she ever leave such sweet girls like you?

817
01:09:57,735 --> 01:10:01,656
别哭了别哭了
Oh, don't cry.

818
01:10:00,142 --> 01:10:02,865
在妳爸爸回来之前
Don't cry. It's all right.

819
01:10:02,519 --> 01:10:06,023
婆婆都会陪着妳的　好不好呀
I'll stay here until your father comes home. Okay? Okay?

820
01:10:47,827 --> 01:10:51,831

823
01:11:05,415 --> 01:11:07,501
小美回来了没？
- Did she come back?    - No.

824
01:11:06,846 --> 01:11:10,796
没在公车站牌那边吗？
- She wasn't at the bus stop?    - No.

825
01:11:10,683 --> 01:11:11,851
这就奇怪了
Let's think.

826
01:11:11,934 --> 01:11:14,174
她会跑到哪里去了？
Do you know anywhere else she might have gone?

827
01:11:13,895 --> 01:11:15,953
我刚刚跟小美吵了一架
I yelled at her this morning. She wanted Mom to come home.

828
01:11:15,953 --> 01:11:18,011
因为她⋯
I yelled at her this morning. She wanted Mom to come home.

829
01:11:17,815 --> 01:11:21,139
她会不会　跑去妈妈住的医院了
Granny, I bet she went to see Mom at the hospital!

830
01:11:20,818 --> 01:11:23,696
七国山医院去了呀
You think she'd try to walk to the hospital?

831
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:26,741
可是就连大人也得　走上三个钟头才会到
Why, that's a three-hour walk even for grown-ups.

832
01:11:26,812 --> 01:11:28,701
我去看看
I'll go look.

833
01:11:29,660 --> 01:11:33,748
勘太　快点去叫你爸爸回来
Kanta! Hurry! Run on home and get your father!

834
01:11:33,527 --> 01:11:36,834
小美不见了
Mei's disappeared, and we need all the help we can get!

835
01:11:44,967 --> 01:11:48,721
小美真是笨蛋　不知道路又爱乱跑
I shouldn't have yelled at her. This is all my fault.

836
01:11:55,811 --> 01:11:58,856
小美
Mei!

837
01:12:05,058 --> 01:12:08,032
打搅了，伯伯，请问⋯⋯
Excuse me, mister! Hello!

838
01:12:07,978 --> 01:12:11,744
您有没有看见束辫子的小女孩　从这条路经过
- Yeah?    - I'm looking for my sister.

839
01:12:10,939 --> 01:12:13,567
她是我妹妹
Did you happen to see a little girl pass this way?

840
01:12:13,704 --> 01:12:16,445
这个嘛⋯⋯小女孩啊
Let's see. Uh, a little girl?

841
01:12:16,457 --> 01:12:20,198
没什么印象
Mmm, I don't think so. I would have noticed.

842
01:12:19,835 --> 01:12:21,921
她会不会没往这边来
I'll try the other road.

843
01:12:40,969 --> 01:12:43,388
妳确定她是往这边来的？
MAN: Are you sure that this is the way she came?

- Oh! Are you crazy?    - I'm looking for my little sister.

850
01:13:22,398 --> 01:13:23,774
我在找我妹妹
- Oh! Are you crazy?    - I'm looking for my little sister.

851
01:13:23,858 --> 01:13:25,776
你们有没有看一个小女孩
Have you seen a girl walking this way?

852
01:13:25,776 --> 01:13:27,695
妳妹妹？
Have you seen a girl walking this way?

853
01:13:26,765 --> 01:13:27,724
Is she lost?

854
01:13:27,737 --> 01:13:29,774
她好像是往七国山医院去了
I think she's trying to walk to the hospital. She's only four years old.

855
01:13:29,774 --> 01:13:31,812
她是一个四岁的小女孩
I think she's trying to walk to the hospital. She's only four years old.

Oh. I didn't see her. Did you?

01:13:34,606 --> 01:13:36,746
我们两个　就是从那个方向来的
No. We just came from the hospital,

858
01:13:36,829 --> 01:13:40,362
不过　好像没有看到那样的小孩
and there was no sign of a little girl on the road.

859
01:13:39,790 --> 01:13:42,823
谢谢你们
Okay. Thanks.

860
01:13:42,710 --> 01:13:44,211
你从哪里来的？
- Wait. Where'd you say you're from?    - From Matsugo.

861
01:13:44,211 --> 01:13:45,713
松乡
- Wait. Where'd you say you're from?    - From Matsugo.

862
01:13:45,742 --> 01:13:47,118
松乡！？
Matsugo! Ho!

863
01:13:47,327 --> 01:13:50,247

01:14:14,867 --> 01:14:17,941
我去往七国山的路上看看
I could ride my bike to the hospital for you.

一定是

01:21:24,832 --> 01:21:26,452
姊姊
- Mei!    - Satsuki!

936
01:21:28,413 --> 01:21:30,358
妳这个傻瓜
- Oh! You're okay.    - I'm sorry.

937
01:21:30,358 --> 01:21:32,304
对不起
- Oh! You're okay.    - I'm sorry.

938
01:21:34,252 --> 01:21:37,768
妳是不是想要把粟米　送去医院给妈妈？
Were you trying to take your corn to Mom at the hospital?

939
01:21:37,422 --> 01:21:38,715
Mmm-hmm.

940
01:21:38,881 --> 01:21:42,927
(YOWLING)

941
01:21:45,596 --> 01:21:48,057
〝七国山医院〞
HOSPITAL

942
01:21:49,780 --> 01:21:52,312
你要送我们去医院吗？
You're going to take us to the hospital?

943
01:21:53,951 --> 01:21:55,994
谢谢你
Thank you!

944
01:21:55,773 --> 01:21:57,567
(LAUGHING)

945
01:22:04,615 --> 01:22:07,827
对不起，只不过是感冒
I'm sorry. I don't know why the hospital sent a telegram.

946
01:22:07,047 --> 01:22:09,842
医院就擅自决定　发电报给家里了
It's just a cold.

947
01:22:09,883 --> 01:22:12,358
那两个孩子一定都很担心我吧
I hope it didn't upset the girls too much. I've caused them enough grief already.

948
01:22:12,358 --> 01:22:14,834
真是苦了她们了
I hope it didn't upset the girls too much. I've caused them enough grief already.

949
01:22:14,805 --> 01:22:17,462
她们知道你平安就会安心的
When they see you're all right, they'll be fine.

950
01:22:17,015 --> 01:22:18,871
这些年来我们一家四口
We'll just wait a little longer for a weekend together.

951
01:22:18,871 --> 01:22:20,727
不都这样努力过来的吗？
We'll just wait a little longer for a weekend together.

952
01:22:20,590 --> 01:22:23,968
享福之前总得吃点苦啊
Don't worry. We've made it this far.

953
01:22:23,856 --> 01:22:27,347
她们表面好像没事　可是心里一定很难过
The girls act so strong, but I think it's been harder than they let on.

954
01:22:27,513 --> 01:22:28,639
Especially Satsuki.

955
01:22:27,776 --> 01:22:30,564
小月越是懂事　就越教人于心不忍
- She tries to act so adult.    - That's true.

956
01:22:30,564 --> 01:22:33,353
是啊
- She tries to act so adult.    - That's true.

957
01:22:33,519 --> 01:22:35,868
出院以后我一定要好好疼她们
I can't wait until I get better.

958
01:22:35,146 --> 01:22:38,036
让她们尽情耍耍小脾气
When I get home, I'm going to spoil those girls rotten.

959
01:22:38,024 --> 01:22:39,025
(LAUGHING)

960
01:22:39,192 --> 01:22:40,860
(INAUDIBLE)

961
01:22:46,199 --> 01:22:48,172
妈妈在笑
Look at Mom. She's laughing.

962
01:22:48,242 --> 01:22:51,120
看样子是没事了
- Everything must be okay.    - Yeah.

963
01:22:58,390 --> 01:23:00,976
我得赶快把身体养好才行
I'm going to hurry up and get well!

964
01:23:01,005 --> 01:23:03,633
是啊
That's the spirit. Huh?

965
01:23:10,485 --> 01:23:11,980
是谁摆的啊？
Who left this?

966
01:23:11,980 --> 01:23:13,476
是谁摆的啊？
(GASPS)

967
01:23:13,780 --> 01:23:15,061
怎么啦？
What is it?

968
01:23:15,686 --> 01:23:19,411
我好像看到小月和小美坐在那棵松树上笑
I thought I saw Satsuki and Mei smiling at us from up in that tree.

969
01:23:21,830 --> 01:23:23,945
搞不好是真的也说不定啊
It sounds crazy, but maybe you did.

970
01:23:23,874 --> 01:23:25,000
妳看

971
01:23:24,862 --> 01:23:27,961
〝送给妈妈〞
- Look at this.    - "For Mommy."

972
01:23:30,159 --> 01:23:33,663

973
01:23:33,830 --> 01:23:37,041
