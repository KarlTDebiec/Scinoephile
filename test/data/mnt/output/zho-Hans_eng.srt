1
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:34,029
爸爸，牛奶糖
Dad, do you want a caramel?

2
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,509
谢谢
Thanks. Aren't you tired?

3
00:02:35,509 --> 00:02:36,906
妳们两个累不累啊？
Thanks. Aren't you tired?

4
00:02:37,072 --> 00:02:37,584
All right.

5
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:38,981
就快到了
We're almost there.

6
00:02:50,472 --> 00:02:51,588
小梅，快躲起来
Mei, hide!

7
00:02:57,632 --> 00:02:59,429
还以为是警察呢！
It wasn't a policeman.

8
00:03:32,152 --> 00:03:34,964
有没有人在家啊？
Hello. Are your parents around?

9
00:03:36,992 --> 00:03:38,311
谢谢
Thanks.

10
00:03:40,312 --> 00:03:44,391
我姓草壁　新搬来的
I'm Kusakabe! We've just arrived!

11
00:03:45,141 --> 00:03:47,394
请多关照
A pleasure to meet you!

12
00:03:47,472 --> 00:03:49,938
搬家辛苦了
Welcome!

13
00:03:54,232 --> 00:03:56,027
谢谢你
Thank you.

14
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:18,675
好，到了
Here we are!

15
00:04:19,872 --> 00:04:21,845
等等人家嘛
Wait!

16
00:04:24,712 --> 00:04:26,182
小梅，有座桥耶
Mei, there's a bridge!

17
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:27,517
有桥？
A bridge?

18
00:04:32,392 --> 00:04:34,941
有鱼耶，又闪了一下
See that flash? Fish too!

19
00:04:35,632 --> 00:04:37,444
怎么样？喜不喜欢？
So, you like it here?

20
00:04:40,032 --> 00:04:42,240
爸爸，这里好棒哦
Dad, it's terrific!

21
00:04:42,352 --> 00:04:44,075
树林中的隧道耶
Look, a tunnel of trees!

22
00:04:46,232 --> 00:04:48,747
那就是新家吗？
Is that our house?

23
00:04:52,712 --> 00:04:54,461
跑快一点！
Come on!

24
00:05:07,349 --> 00:05:09,392
好破哦
It's a wreck!

25
00:05:09,352 --> 00:05:10,935
好破哦
Wreck!

26
00:05:10,992 --> 00:05:12,562
好像一间鬼屋哦
Looks like a haunted house!

27
00:05:12,512 --> 00:05:13,563
鬼屋
Haunted?

28
00:05:21,272 --> 00:05:22,572
柱子烂掉了
And it's all rotten!

29
00:05:34,192 --> 00:05:35,835
要倒了！
It's gonna fall down!

30
00:05:35,832 --> 00:05:37,754
要倒了！
Fall down!

31
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:49,391
小梅，妳看
Look, Mei!

32
00:05:51,672 --> 00:05:53,103
妳看
See?

33
00:06:02,192 --> 00:06:03,947
好大哦
It's huge.

34
00:06:09,312 --> 00:06:12,038
爸爸，好大的树哦
Dad, there's a huge tree!

35
00:06:12,632 --> 00:06:14,624
那叫做樟树
It's a camphor tree.

36
00:06:16,472 --> 00:06:17,550
樟树耶
Camphor tree…

37
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:18,628
樟树
Camphor tree…

38
00:06:27,712 --> 00:06:28,622
Oops!

39
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:32,350
橡果子
An acorn!

40
00:06:34,072 --> 00:06:36,229
我看一下
Show me.

41
00:06:37,472 --> 00:06:38,982
那里也有
Another one!

42
00:06:43,952 --> 00:06:46,489
捡到了
One for me!

43
00:06:52,432 --> 00:06:55,040
别玩了　这样木门打不开
Out of the way. I can't open the screens.

44
00:06:55,552 --> 00:06:56,708
橡果子
Acorns!

45
00:06:56,712 --> 00:06:59,169
有好多橡果子　掉落到屋里面来耶
There's acorns in the house.

46
00:06:59,232 --> 00:07:00,837
从上面掉下来的
They dropped from up there!

47
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:08,345
该不会是我们家有松鼠吧？
Maybe there are squirrels in here.

48
00:07:08,512 --> 00:07:10,263
松鼠？
Squirrels, really?

49
00:07:10,832 --> 00:07:13,183
还是吃橡果子的老鼠呢？
Or rats that like acorns.

50
00:07:14,152 --> 00:07:15,852
我喜欢松鼠
I'd rather have squirrels!

51
00:07:16,312 --> 00:07:18,355
这要搬到哪儿呢？
Where shall I put this?

52
00:07:18,872 --> 00:07:21,170
放这里，我这就开门
Here, I'll get the door for you. Satsuki, open up the kitchen.

53
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:23,468
小月，妳去把后门打开
Here, I'll get the door for you. Satsuki, open up the kitchen.

54
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:24,027
好

55
00:07:24,112 --> 00:07:25,737
去了就看得到
It's just round the back.

56
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:29,366
快点
Mei, come on!

57
00:07:30,672 --> 00:07:32,369
等人家嘛
Wait for me!

58
00:07:33,632 --> 00:07:35,455
快点
Hurry!

59
00:08:13,512 --> 00:08:14,619
进去啰
Ready?

60
00:08:26,992 --> 00:08:28,341
浴室
Bathtubs.

61
00:08:34,312 --> 00:08:35,724
不见了
There's nothing here.

62
00:08:37,712 --> 00:08:39,102
这间是浴室
That's the bathroom.

63
00:08:39,152 --> 00:08:41,021
爸爸，有怪东西耶
Dad, there's something in here.

64
00:08:41,032 --> 00:08:41,980
松鼠吗？
A squirrel?

65
00:08:41,992 --> 00:08:43,642
不知道
Dunno. A bunch of black things but not roaches or mice.

66
00:08:43,642 --> 00:08:45,292
不像蟑螂也不像老鼠
Dunno. A bunch of black things but not roaches or mice.

67
00:08:45,292 --> 00:08:46,943
只知道是一堆黑黑的东西
Dunno. A bunch of black things but not roaches or mice.

68
00:08:46,872 --> 00:08:48,624
Really?

69
00:09:00,192 --> 00:09:01,416
有没有？
Can you see 'em?

70
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:04,502
那一定是「灰尘精灵」
I think they were… soot gremlins.

71
00:09:04,712 --> 00:09:06,088
灰尘精灵
'Gremlins'? Like in my picture book?

72
00:09:06,088 --> 00:09:07,465
画册里有吗？
'Gremlins'? Like in my picture book?

73
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:09,298
有啊
That's right. Ghosts don't come out on days like this.

74
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:11,092
今天天气那么好　鬼不可能出来的
That's right. Ghosts don't come out on days like this.

75
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:18,850
我们从亮的地方　一下子进到暗的地方
When you walk into a dark room from outside,

76
00:09:19,312 --> 00:09:21,978
眼睛就会发昏　灰尘精灵就会跑出来
your eyes dim and so the dustbunnies come out.

77
00:09:22,272 --> 00:09:23,563
原来是这样啊
Oh, I see.

78
00:09:23,952 --> 00:09:27,302
灰尘精灵快点滚出来
Come here, soot gremlins. Come out, come out, wherever you are!

79
00:09:27,302 --> 00:09:30,653
你要躲著不出来　我就把你眼睛挖出来！
Come here, soot gremlins. Come out, come out, wherever you are!

80
00:09:36,072 --> 00:09:38,513
好了，做事啦
Let's get to work! See if you can find how to get upstairs.

81
00:09:38,513 --> 00:09:40,955
上二楼的楼梯　到底在哪里呢？
Let's get to work! See if you can find how to get upstairs.

82
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:43,604
妳们两个去把楼梯找出来
Get up there and open all the windows.

83
00:09:43,604 --> 00:09:45,085
然后把二楼的窗户打开
Get up there and open all the windows.

84
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:46,503
好
Sure!

85
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:48,171
人家也要
I'm coming, too!

86
00:09:56,672 --> 00:09:58,151
厕所
Toilet!

87
00:10:00,632 --> 00:10:01,768
咦？
Not here!

88
00:10:04,688 --> 00:10:06,981
咦？

89
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:10,985
咦？

90
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:12,570
咦？

91
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:17,659
咦？

92
00:10:19,312 --> 00:10:20,412
没有
Nothing here!

93
00:10:20,952 --> 00:10:22,539
没有
Nothing!

94
00:10:32,352 --> 00:10:34,467
小梅，找到了
Mei, it's here!

95
00:10:40,992 --> 00:10:42,684
乌漆抹黑的耶
It's pitch black!

96
00:10:42,752 --> 00:10:44,561
灰尘精灵呢？
Soot gremlins…

97
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:54,154
橡果子
Another acorn.

98
00:11:00,392 --> 00:11:04,247
灰尘精灵快点滚出来
Come out, soot gremlins!

99
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:45,538
灰尘精灵
Are you there, Mr. Soot Gremlin?

100
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:47,374
你在不在？
Are you there, Mr. Soot Gremlin?

101
00:12:12,792 --> 00:12:16,861
爸爸，真的有怪东西耶
Dad, there's definitely something here!

102
00:12:16,952 --> 00:12:20,055
那真是太棒了
That's exciting! I've always wanted to live in a haunted house.

103
00:12:20,055 --> 00:12:23,159
爸爸从小就梦想　能够住在鬼屋里面
That's exciting! I've always wanted to live in a haunted house.

104
00:12:25,992 --> 00:12:27,311
糟了
I'm coming!

105
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,942
抓到了！姊姊
I got it. Satsuki!

106
00:13:28,752 --> 00:13:29,809
小梅
Mei.

107
00:13:40,352 --> 00:13:42,364
好活泼呀
You're full of energy!

108
00:13:42,592 --> 00:13:44,267
这位是一直照顾这个家
This is 'Nanny'. She looks after the house and came to help.

109
00:13:44,267 --> 00:13:45,943
住在隔壁的婆婆
This is 'Nanny'. She looks after the house and came to help.

110
00:13:45,943 --> 00:13:47,619
婆婆今天是来帮忙的
This is 'Nanny'. She looks after the house and came to help.

111
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,454
我叫做小月，这是我妹妹小梅
I'm Satsuki and this is my sister, Mei.

112
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:51,081
婆婆好
I'm Satsuki and this is my sister, Mei.

113
00:13:51,112 --> 00:13:54,000
好，妳们好啊
Nice to meet you both.

114
00:13:54,032 --> 00:13:56,204
这孩子真是聪明伶俐耶
I'd have cleaned up if I'd known you'd be this quick.

115
00:13:56,204 --> 00:13:58,376
如果你们不急著搬进来
I'd have cleaned up if I'd known you'd be this quick.

116
00:13:58,376 --> 00:14:00,548
我还打算请人先收拾一下呢
I'd have cleaned up if I'd known you'd be this quick.

117
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:02,863
这样子已经很好了
No, you've done plenty.

118
00:14:03,032 --> 00:14:05,752
现在这时节田里农事可忙呢
Lately I've been so busy in the rice paddies, I only did a bit of dusting…

119
00:14:05,752 --> 00:14:08,473
不过我还是偶尔会来打扫
Lately I've been so busy in the rice paddies, I only did a bit of dusting…

120
00:14:09,752 --> 00:14:11,156
小梅，妳手怎么脏兮兮的？
What have you done to your hands?

121
00:14:11,156 --> 00:14:12,560
怎么弄的？
What have you done to your hands?

122
00:14:12,632 --> 00:14:14,938
灰尘精灵跑掉了
The soot gremlin got away…

123
00:14:14,872 --> 00:14:16,988
妳看妳的脚
Your feet, too!

124
00:14:20,992 --> 00:14:23,113
我的脚也脏兮兮的
Mine are black, too!

125
00:14:25,448 --> 00:14:29,285
哎呀呀！

126
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:34,332
看样子是煤煤虫在做怪
That must be the ‘soot sprites'.

127
00:14:34,512 --> 00:14:36,579
煤煤虫？
Those little, black, fuzzy things that fly?

128
00:14:36,579 --> 00:14:38,646
妳说的煤煤虫是不是会
Those little, black, fuzzy things that fly?

129
00:14:38,646 --> 00:14:40,714
「哇啦哇啦」的乱跑啊
Those little, black, fuzzy things that fly?

130
00:14:40,832 --> 00:14:43,150
是啊
That's right. They breed in empty old houses,

131
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:45,468
它们专门跑到没人住的旧房子里
That's right. They breed in empty old houses,

132
00:14:45,512 --> 00:14:49,264
然后弄得满屋子的灰尘和煤灰
and cover them with soot and dust.

133
00:14:50,312 --> 00:14:54,021
我小时候也有看过
I could see them when I was little. Now you can too, huh?

134
00:14:54,021 --> 00:14:57,731
想不到妳们也看到
I could see them when I was little. Now you can too, huh?

135
00:14:57,832 --> 00:14:59,482
婆婆，它们是妖怪吗？
Are they like goblins or something?

136
00:14:59,912 --> 00:15:03,945
其实也没什么好怕的
Naah, nothing so scary.

137
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:06,885
只要对它们笑笑　它们就不会害人
If you keep smiling, they'll soon leave the house.

138
00:15:06,885 --> 00:15:09,701
住上一阵子之后　它们自然就会不见
If you keep smiling, they'll soon leave the house.

139
00:15:10,994 --> 00:15:15,071
说不定它们已经在天花板上　讨论该搬去哪里了呢
They're probably deciding where to go next, right now.

140
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,922
小梅，它们很快就会不见了
Mei, they're going away.

141
00:15:23,032 --> 00:15:23,923
不好玩
That's no fun.

142
00:15:24,049 --> 00:15:26,634
可是要是来这么一大堆　该怎么办？
What happens if a huge one comes out, like this?

143
00:15:27,052 --> 00:15:28,345
人家才不怕那些呢
I wouldn't be scared.

144
00:15:28,552 --> 00:15:30,450
是吗？
Okay then, I won't walk you to the bathroom at night.

145
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:32,349
那以后晚上　姊姊就不陪妳去尿尿啰
Okay then, I won't walk you to the bathroom at night.

146
00:15:34,592 --> 00:15:37,140
来来⋯快来打扫吧
Okay, cleaning time. Could you get some water from the stream?

147
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:39,689
妳们去河边打点水回来吧
Okay, cleaning time. Could you get some water from the stream?

148
00:15:39,712 --> 00:15:40,857
河边啊
From the stream?

149
00:15:40,982 --> 00:15:42,027
人家也要去
I'm coming, too!

150
00:15:45,792 --> 00:15:47,350
小梅，妳在一边等著
Mei, wait there.

151
00:15:56,872 --> 00:15:58,783
有没有抓到鱼？
Did you get a fish?

152
00:16:10,432 --> 00:16:12,430
婆婆，有水啰
Nanny, it's coming out!

153
00:16:12,872 --> 00:16:15,153
好好打啊
Good, keep pumping 'til the water gets cold.

154
00:16:15,153 --> 00:16:17,435
打到水变凉为止
Good, keep pumping 'til the water gets cold.

155
00:16:17,752 --> 00:16:18,980
好
Okay!

156
00:17:01,146 --> 00:17:04,107
你不是刚刚那个吗？　有事吗？
May I help you?

157
00:17:05,432 --> 00:17:08,111
我妈妈要给婆婆的
Huh… my Mom… for Granny.

158
00:17:10,155 --> 00:17:11,322
是什么？
Yes?

159
00:17:17,352 --> 00:17:19,122
等等，这是什么啊？
Wait, what is it?

160
00:17:20,112 --> 00:17:21,916
是勘太吗？
Is that you, Kanta?

161
00:17:23,512 --> 00:17:28,923
你们家是可怕的大鬼屋
You live in a haunted house!

162
00:17:29,112 --> 00:17:30,425
勘太！
Kanta, stop it!

163
00:17:40,672 --> 00:17:43,271
爸爸以前也这样作弄过女生
I did the same when I was his age.

164
00:17:43,832 --> 00:17:46,367
男生最讨人厌了
I hate boys. But I really love Nanny's rice cakes!

165
00:17:46,367 --> 00:17:48,902
不过　婆婆这个糯米团好好吃耶
I hate boys. But I really love Nanny's rice cakes!

166
00:17:49,272 --> 00:17:51,446
那就多吃点啊
Eat as much as you want.

167
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:53,386
辛苦了
Thank you!

168
00:17:56,432 --> 00:17:58,495
真是太谢谢您了
Thank you very much for your help.

169
00:17:59,672 --> 00:18:01,822
婆婆再见
Good bye!

170
00:19:16,392 --> 00:19:19,576
爸爸，我们家　破破烂烂的会不会垮掉？
Dad, the house is going to fall down.

171
00:19:21,752 --> 00:19:24,748
要是才刚搬来就垮掉　那可怎么得了
I hope not; we've only just moved in.

172
00:19:59,752 --> 00:20:01,435
我们一起大笑看看
Come on, let's laugh to keep the bogeymen away!

173
00:20:01,435 --> 00:20:03,119
可怕的东西就会跑光
Come on, let's laugh to keep the bogeymen away!

174
00:20:05,352 --> 00:20:07,123
人家才不怕呢！
I'm not scared.

175
00:20:08,232 --> 00:20:10,001
人家才不怕呢！
I mean it. I'm not scared!

176
00:20:54,112 --> 00:20:57,340
一，二，一，二，一，二
One-two, one-two…

177
00:20:57,192 --> 00:20:59,018
很好，加油
Come on, keep up the good work…

178
00:20:59,018 --> 00:21:00,844
用力，加把劲
Come on, keep up the good work…

179
00:21:06,182 --> 00:21:09,060
好了　衣服通通洗好了
Okay! Washing… finished!

180
00:21:18,312 --> 00:21:20,447
出发了！
Here we go!

181
00:21:37,392 --> 00:21:40,050
婆婆
Nanny!

182
00:21:40,432 --> 00:21:42,552
您好！！
Hello!

183
00:21:42,552 --> 00:21:44,220
您可真忙啊
Hard at work?

184
00:21:44,552 --> 00:21:47,349
三个一起出门啊？
Where're you all heading?

185
00:21:47,474 --> 00:21:50,226
我们要去医院看妈妈
To visit Mommy in the hospital!

186
00:21:50,352 --> 00:21:52,979
可有好一段路呢
That's nice. Give her my regards!

187
00:21:52,979 --> 00:21:55,607
替我帮妳们妈妈问好
That's nice. Give her my regards!

188
00:21:55,732 --> 00:21:57,150
好的

189
00:22:13,352 --> 00:22:15,183
走这边！走这边！
This way.

190
00:22:42,232 --> 00:22:43,113
大家好
Hello.

191
00:22:43,392 --> 00:22:44,906
妳好
Hello there.

192
00:22:46,491 --> 00:22:47,450
妈妈！
Mommy!

193
00:22:47,472 --> 00:22:50,036
小梅妳也来啦
So glad you came, my dear.

194
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:52,455
爸爸还走错路呢
Daddy took the wrong road.

195
00:22:52,472 --> 00:22:53,902
真的吗？
Really? Hello, Satsuki.

196
00:22:53,902 --> 00:22:55,333
妳也来啦
Really? Hello, Satsuki.

197
00:22:55,458 --> 00:22:57,210
今天是农假休息一天
It's a school holiday today.

198
00:22:57,272 --> 00:22:58,670
是啊
How nice.

199
00:22:58,632 --> 00:23:01,381
爸爸正在跟医生说话
Daddy is talking to the doctor.

200
00:23:01,548 --> 00:23:03,466
妈妈好高兴你们都来了
It's so good to see you all.

201
00:23:03,832 --> 00:23:05,234
新家怎么样啦？
Have you settled into the new house?

202
00:23:05,234 --> 00:23:06,636
都整理好了没？
Have you settled into the new house?

203
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:14,352
咦？我们家是鬼屋啊
A haunted house?

204
00:23:14,752 --> 00:23:17,105
妈妈喜欢住鬼屋吗？
Mom, do you like ghosts?

205
00:23:17,312 --> 00:23:18,981
当然啰
Of course I do! I can't wait to see them.

206
00:23:18,981 --> 00:23:20,650
妈妈真想快点出院　看看鬼长什么样子
Of course I do! I can't wait to see them.

207
00:23:20,592 --> 00:23:22,277
小梅太好了
See, I told you Mei.

208
00:23:23,272 --> 00:23:25,047
我好担心哦
Mei was worried that you wouldn't like ghosts.

209
00:23:25,047 --> 00:23:26,823
因为我好怕　妈妈会不喜欢那里
Mei was worried that you wouldn't like ghosts.

210
00:23:26,832 --> 00:23:28,116
那妳们两个呢？
What about you two?

211
00:23:28,192 --> 00:23:29,159
喜欢
I love them!

212
00:23:29,232 --> 00:23:31,119
妈妈我不怕鬼
I'm not scared of them!

213
00:23:33,432 --> 00:23:36,166
小梅的头发都是妳梳的吗？
Are you fixing Mei's hair, Satsuki?

214
00:23:37,232 --> 00:23:38,513
梳得真好
It's really good. Lucky girl, Mei.

215
00:23:38,513 --> 00:23:39,794
要好好谢姊姊哦！小梅
It's really good. Lucky girl, Mei.

216
00:23:41,072 --> 00:23:43,340
可是姊姊动不动就生气
But she always gets mad at me.

217
00:23:43,472 --> 00:23:45,175
还不都是因为妳不乖
That's 'cuz you won't stay still.

218
00:23:45,192 --> 00:23:47,302
小月，过来让妈妈看看
Come here, Satsuki.

219
00:23:47,792 --> 00:23:49,464
妳的头发会不会太短了？
Isn't yours too short?

220
00:23:49,672 --> 00:23:50,972
我喜欢这个样子
No, I like it like this.

221
00:23:50,992 --> 00:23:53,016
人家也要！人家也要！
Do mine, Mommy! Mine, too!

222
00:23:53,032 --> 00:23:54,017
排队！
Wait your turn!

223
00:23:54,552 --> 00:23:56,995
头发还是一样老会乱翘
Wavy hair, just like mine when I was your age.

224
00:23:56,995 --> 00:23:59,439
就跟妈妈小时候一样
Wavy hair, just like mine when I was your age.

225
00:23:59,564 --> 00:24:01,545
那我长大以后
Will it be like yours when I grow up?

226
00:24:01,545 --> 00:24:03,526
头发会不会　变得跟妈妈的一样呢？
Will it be like yours when I grow up?

227
00:24:03,832 --> 00:24:05,764
应该会吧
Probably. You take after your Mom.

228
00:24:05,764 --> 00:24:07,697
因为妳跟妈妈最像了
Probably. You take after your Mom.

229
00:24:25,352 --> 00:24:27,342
妈妈好像好了很多耶
Mom looked really well.

230
00:24:27,432 --> 00:24:29,347
是啊
You're right.The doctor says she'll be home soon.

231
00:24:29,347 --> 00:24:31,262
医生也说　再过不久就可以出院了
You're right.The doctor says she'll be home soon.

232
00:24:31,792 --> 00:24:33,556
再过不久，明天吗？
Soon? Like tomorrow?

233
00:24:33,752 --> 00:24:35,934
妳什么都是明天
You always say this.

234
00:24:35,952 --> 00:24:37,727
明天可能有点难耶
Tomorrow is a little too soon.

235
00:24:38,512 --> 00:24:41,523
妈妈说想跟小梅一起睡
Mom said she'll sleep with me in my bed.

236
00:24:41,592 --> 00:24:45,902
咦？妳不是说妳已经长大　要自己一个人睡的吗？
Weren't you saying you're big enough to sleep alone?

237
00:24:45,912 --> 00:24:48,154
跟妈妈睡没关系
Mom is special!

238
00:25:09,512 --> 00:25:11,325
爸爸
Dad, time to get up!

239
00:25:11,325 --> 00:25:13,138
天亮啰
Dad, time to get up!

240
00:25:16,832 --> 00:25:19,266
起床！
Wake up!

241
00:25:24,592 --> 00:25:26,401
对不起，爸爸又睡过头了
Sorry, I overslept again…

242
00:25:26,512 --> 00:25:28,343
今天开始要带便当
I've got to bring a box lunch today.

243
00:25:28,592 --> 00:25:30,780
糟糕，爸爸全给忘了
I totally forgot about it.

244
00:25:31,114 --> 00:25:33,547
没关系，我也帮你们做好了
It's all right. I've made something for all of us.

245
00:25:33,792 --> 00:25:34,784
烧焦了
It's burning!

246
00:25:34,752 --> 00:25:35,744
马上来
I'm coming.

247
00:25:38,705 --> 00:25:40,668
这是小梅的
Here, this is yours, Mei.

248
00:25:41,499 --> 00:25:42,876
我的啊
It's for me?

249

小梅，坐下来好好吃饭
Mei, sit down and eat!

糟了，来啰
I'm coming!

255
00:26:01,102 --> 00:26:02,979
这么快就交到朋友啦？
You made a friend already?

256
00:26:03,032 --> 00:26:05,148
叫得可真亲密呢
She's calling you!

257
00:26:05,512 --> 00:26:07,275

爸爸！
Daddy!

264
00:26:36,112 --> 00:26:37,847
你看我像不像姊姊？
Do I look all grown up?

265
00:26:37,832 --> 00:26:40,183
妳揹著便当要上哪儿去？
Yes dear. And where might you be going?

266
00:26:40,272 --> 00:26:42,143
就在附近走走
I'm just going out.

267
00:27:04,432 --> 00:27:06,876
爸爸，可以吃便当了吗？
Daddy, is it lunch yet?

268
00:27:06,752 --> 00:27:08,962
一早就想吃呀？
Already?

269
00:27:20,872 --> 00:27:23,643
爸爸你是花店
You be the flower shop, Daddy.

283
00:35:55,272 --> 00:35:57,183
小梅呢？待会我要去小满家
Where's Mei? I'm off to Michiko's.

284
00:35:57,352 --> 00:35:59,047
爸爸还没吃便当呢
We haven't eaten yet. Is Mei in the garden?

285
00:35:59,047 --> 00:36:00,742
小梅没有在院子里玩吗？
We haven't eaten yet. Is Mei in the garden?

286
00:36:00,827 --> 00:36:01,536
小梅

妳干什么睡在这里！
You shouldn't sleep here!

294
00:36:54,047 --> 00:36:55,340
大龙猫咧？
Where's Totoro?

大龙猫刚才还在的
Totoro was here.

妳是说画册上那个大妖怪吗？

小梅说　她看到一只大龙猫

00:37:54,024 --> 00:37:55,027
是这里吗？
Here?

317
00:37:55,232 --> 00:37:56,267
No.

318
00:37:56,818 --> 00:37:59,227
牠刚才　睡在一个好大的树里面
It went to a big tree.

319
00:37:59,279 --> 00:38:01,428
可是这里只有一条路啊
But there wasn't any other path.

320
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:04,506
小梅，妳快回来啊
Mei! Come back!

321
00:38:05,035 --> 00:38:07,037
小梅，回来啊

322
00:38:19,432 --> 00:38:21,411
真的有啦
But it's true! Totoro was here.

323
00:38:21,411 --> 00:38:23,391
刚才真的有大龙猫
But it's true! Totoro was here.

324
00:38:23,872 --> 00:38:25,100
我没有骗你们
I'm not lying.

325
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:35,565
小梅啊
I know, Mei.

326
00:38:36,149 --> 00:38:37,734
人家没有骗你们
I didn't lie.

327
00:38:37,872 --> 00:38:40,493
其实爸爸跟姊姊
Neither of us think you're lying.

328
00:38:40,493 --> 00:38:43,114
也没有认为妳在骗人啊
Neither of us think you're lying.

329
00:38:43,552 --> 00:38:46,328
小梅刚才一定是　遇到了森林的主人
You probably met the king of this forest. You were very lucky.

330
00:38:46,328 --> 00:38:49,104
这就表示小梅运气很好
You probably met the king of this forest. You were very lucky.

331
00:38:49,829 --> 00:38:52,749
不过这种机会并不常有
He doesn't come out very often.

332
00:38:54,250 --> 00:38:56,544
对了，我们还没有跟它打招呼
We should pay our respects at the shrine.

333
00:38:56,632 --> 00:38:57,545
打招呼？
Pay our respects?

334
00:38:57,671 --> 00:38:59,390
现在向大树出发啰
To this forest.

335
00:39:15,912 --> 00:39:18,817
小梅好像变重了
Mei, you're getting heavy.

336
00:39:18,983 --> 00:39:20,652
爸爸，你看那樟树
Daddy, look! That camphor tree!

337
00:39:21,861 --> 00:39:23,029
好大哦
What a big tree.

338
00:39:31,329 --> 00:39:32,148
就是它！
It's here!

339
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:34,791
是这棵吗？
Is that the tree?

340
00:39:35,709 --> 00:39:38,180
爸爸，快来啊
Dad, hurry up.

341
00:39:49,014 --> 00:39:51,016
那个洞不见了
The hole has gone.

342
00:39:51,141 --> 00:39:52,517
真的是这里吗？
Are you sure it was here?

343
00:39:54,185 --> 00:39:56,103
小梅她说洞不见了
The hole disappeared.

344
00:39:56,187 --> 00:39:57,417
所以我说啦
I told you he doesn't come to see us often.

345
00:39:57,417 --> 00:39:58,648
那不是想看　随时就能看到的
I told you he doesn't come to see us often.

346
00:39:58,898 --> 00:40:00,182
还会再看得到吗？
But will he come again? I want to meet him, too.

347
00:40:00,182 --> 00:40:01,466
我也好想看哦
But will he come again? I want to meet him, too.

348
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:05,145
那得碰运气啰
If you're lucky, sure.

349
00:40:06,364 --> 00:40:08,064
这棵树真大啊
What a beautiful tree.

350
00:40:09,712 --> 00:40:11,907
一定是从很久很久以前
This tree must have stood here for years and years.

351
00:40:11,907 --> 00:40:14,103
就已经长在这里的
This tree must have stood here for years and years.

352
00:40:15,415 --> 00:40:17,443
很久很久以前
Trees and people used to be good friends.

353
00:40:17,443 --> 00:40:19,471
树木跟我们人的感情很好
Trees and people used to be good friends.

354
00:40:20,462 --> 00:40:22,771
爸爸就是因为看到这棵树
I saw that tree and fell in love with the house. Hope Mom likes it, too.

355
00:40:22,771 --> 00:40:25,080
才会这么喜欢现在这个家的
I saw that tree and fell in love with the house. Hope Mom likes it, too.

356
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:27,390
而且知道　妈妈一定也会喜欢这里
I saw that tree and fell in love with the house. Hope Mom likes it, too.

357
00:40:27,552 --> 00:40:29,158
来，我们谢谢它再回家
Okay, let's pay our respects then get home for lunch.

358
00:40:29,158 --> 00:40:30,764
该吃饭啰
Okay, let's pay our respects then get home for lunch.

359
00:40:30,889 --> 00:40:33,391
对了　我跟小满约好要到她家去
Yes, I promised to go see Michiko.

360
00:40:33,552 --> 00:40:35,018
人家也要去
I want to go, too!

361
00:40:35,310 --> 00:40:36,467
立正站好！
Attention!

362
00:40:36,936 --> 00:40:39,167
多谢您照顾我们家小梅
Thank you for looking after Mei.

363
00:40:39,167 --> 00:40:41,399
从今以后还盼您多多关照
Thank you for looking after Mei.

364
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:43,735
请您多多关照
Please take care of us.

365
00:40:44,472 --> 00:40:45,570
我们比赛看谁先到家
Let's race home!

366
00:40:45,695 --> 00:40:47,155
爸爸偷跑

367
00:40:48,472 --> 00:40:50,269
等人家嘛
Wait!

368
00:40:51,552 --> 00:40:53,429
小梅，快点
Hurry up!

369
00:40:53,578 --> 00:40:55,668
等人家嘛
Wait for me!

370
00:40:57,912 --> 00:41:00,665
今天出了一件大新闻
Dear Mother, something amazing happened today.

371
00:41:01,252 --> 00:41:04,589
因为小梅说她看到了　一只很大的龙猫精灵
Mei met a giant Totoro.

372
00:41:09,512 --> 00:41:14,028
我好希望我也能够见牠一面
And I'm hoping to see him myself soon, too.

373
00:41:44,254 --> 00:41:46,360
勘太
Kanta, hurry up! You'll be late!

374
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:48,466
－再不快点就要迟到了　－嗯
Kanta, hurry up! You'll be late!

375
00:42:31,176 --> 00:42:32,347
小梅
Mei?

376
00:42:32,952 --> 00:42:34,012
老师
Excuse me!

377
00:42:34,179 --> 00:42:35,665
什么事？小月
Yes, Satsuki?

378
00:42:36,222 --> 00:42:37,974
我妹妹⋯
It's my sister…

379
00:42:45,065 --> 00:42:46,858
婆婆，小梅？
What happened, Nanny?

380
00:42:46,983 --> 00:42:49,339
对不起
I'm sorry. She insisted that she be with you.

381
00:42:49,339 --> 00:42:51,696
她一直吵著　要到姊姊那边去所以⋯
I'm sorry. She insisted that she be with you.

382
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:53,507
可是
It's Dad's day at the university.

383
00:42:53,507 --> 00:42:54,985
小梅
It's Dad's day at the university.

384
00:42:54,985 --> 00:42:56,463
今天是爸爸　要到大学去教课的日子
It's Dad's day at the university.

385
00:42:56,576 --> 00:42:58,244
我们不是说好了
You promised to be a good girl at Nanny's.

386
00:42:58,244 --> 00:42:59,913
妳要在婆婆家　乖乖等姊姊放学的吗？
You promised to be a good girl at Nanny's.

387
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:04,709
姊姊还要再上两个小时的课
I still have two more classes and Nanny's too busy for this…

388
00:43:04,709 --> 00:43:06,878
婆婆的田里又那么忙
I still have two more classes and Nanny's too busy for this…

389
00:43:07,212 --> 00:43:12,181
小梅在婆婆的家里一直都很乖的
She was good up 'til now, weren't you?

390
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:21,768
婆婆，那我去跟老师说说看
I'll go talk to my teacher.

391
00:43:27,792 --> 00:43:30,204
现在小月因为妈妈住院
Since Satsuki's mother is in the hospital, I want you all to be nice to her.

392
00:43:30,204 --> 00:43:32,616
所以妹妹暂时没人照顾
Since Satsuki's mother is in the hospital, I want you all to be nice to her.

393
00:43:32,616 --> 00:43:35,028
同学们要好好跟她相处啊
Since Satsuki's mother is in the hospital, I want you all to be nice to her.

394
00:43:34,864 --> 00:43:36,282
好，好

395
00:43:42,122 --> 00:43:43,551
这是什么啊？
What's that?

396
00:43:43,712 --> 00:43:45,041
大龙猫呀
It's Totoro.

397
00:43:45,672 --> 00:43:48,753
不要吵
Mei, you should keep quiet.

398
00:43:48,712 --> 00:43:49,667
Okay.

399
00:43:56,970 --> 00:43:59,764
再见再见，明天见了

400
00:44:00,032 --> 00:44:02,626
再见
Bye bye, Mei!

401
00:44:03,032 --> 00:44:04,686
我今天不能去社团了
I can't stay after class today.

402
00:44:04,752 --> 00:44:06,583
我去跟老师说
We'll let teacher know.

403
00:44:06,688 --> 00:44:08,191
再见了
See you!

404
00:44:07,939 --> 00:44:08,940
拜拜，再见

405
00:44:09,912 --> 00:44:11,901
小梅，快点，要下雨了
Hurry up, it's going to rain!

406
00:44:11,712 --> 00:44:12,622
Okay.

407
00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:22,185
下雨了
Here it comes!

408
00:44:39,304 --> 00:44:42,557
－人家都没有哭，棒不棒？　－嗯
I won't cry. Aren't I good?

409
00:44:44,184 --> 00:44:46,666
可是真伤脑筋耶
It's getting worse…

410
00:44:48,912 --> 00:44:52,382
土地公爷爷　请您让我们躲一下雨
Dear Guardian Spirit, let us stay until the rain stops.

411
00:45:35,992 --> 00:45:37,237
可是⋯
But…

412
00:45:57,549 --> 00:45:59,742
姊姊，有伞好棒哦
That was lucky.

413
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:02,929
伞顶破了好多个洞耶
It's got holes in it.

414
00:46:14,607 --> 00:46:17,027
爸爸今天好像没带伞
Daddy forgot his umbrella.

415
00:46:17,192 --> 00:46:18,830
人家也要去接爸爸
I'm going, too.

416
00:46:22,152 --> 00:46:23,870
不就是忘了嘛
I said I forgot it!

417
00:46:23,992 --> 00:46:25,727
明明都已经下雨了
What idiot forgets his umbrella on a rainy day?

418
00:46:25,727 --> 00:46:27,462
竟然还会傻得忘了带伞　你骗鬼啊！
What idiot forgets his umbrella on a rainy day?

419
00:46:27,829 --> 00:46:29,372
好痛哦
Ouch!

420
00:46:29,622 --> 00:46:31,791
我看啊　你八成是把伞给玩坏了
You broke it playing, I bet.

421
00:46:31,912 --> 00:46:33,209
才不是呢
I did not!

422
00:46:46,556 --> 00:46:47,974
有人在家吗？
Excuse me.

423
00:46:50,112 --> 00:46:52,006
小月？还有小梅
Hello Satsuki. Hi, Mei. Grandma!

424
00:46:52,006 --> 00:46:53,900
妈
Hello Satsuki. Hi, Mei. Grandma!

425
00:46:55,312 --> 00:46:56,775
今天真的是麻烦你们了
I'm sorry about Mei today.

426
00:46:56,912 --> 00:46:59,152
哪儿的话
Not at all. Sorry we couldn't do more.

427
00:46:59,272 --> 00:47:02,322
对了　这是勘太今天借我们的伞
Kanta lent us this umbrella.

428
00:47:02,447 --> 00:47:04,470
这孩子⋯
He did? A broken old thing like that!

429
00:47:04,470 --> 00:47:06,493
这么破的伞真不好意思
He did? A broken old thing like that!

430
00:47:06,618 --> 00:47:08,782
这把伞帮了我们好大的忙
Mei was with me, so I was glad.

431
00:47:08,870 --> 00:47:10,708
不过却害勘太都淋湿了
But I'm so sorry that Kanta got wet.

432
00:47:10,708 --> 00:47:12,547
麻烦伯母谢谢勘太
But I'm so sorry that Kanta got wet.

433
00:47:12,791 --> 00:47:14,376
不必客气
Not at all. It probably cleaned him up a little.

434
00:47:14,376 --> 00:47:15,962
反正他老是搞得全身都是泥
Not at all. It probably cleaned him up a little.

435
00:47:15,962 --> 00:47:17,548
淋淋雨反而干净些
Not at all. It probably cleaned him up a little.

436
00:47:18,032 --> 00:47:19,673
你们要去接爸爸啊
Are you off to meet your father?

437
00:47:19,552 --> 00:47:20,109
Yes.

438
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:21,865
真是孝顺啊
What good girls you are.

439
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:23,634
小梅，拜拜
Bye bye, Mei.

440
00:47:23,634 --> 00:47:24,969
拜拜
Bye bye, Mei.

441
00:47:35,232 --> 00:47:36,981
刚才是谁来了呀？
Who was that?

442
00:47:37,190 --> 00:47:37,982
才懒得理呢

443
00:47:42,654 --> 00:47:44,623
刚好赶上
Just in time!

444
00:47:57,669 --> 00:47:58,901
妳们要坐车吗？
Getting on?

445
00:48:00,232 --> 00:48:01,950
开车
All right, drive on.

446
00:48:10,348 --> 00:48:12,547
爸爸没有搭这班车
Daddy wasn't on it.

447
00:48:12,684 --> 00:48:14,853
一定是搭下一班啦
He'll be on the next one. Why don't you wait at Nanny's?

448
00:48:14,853 --> 00:48:17,022
小梅，妳到婆婆家等好不好？
He'll be on the next one. Why don't you wait at Nanny's?

449
00:48:52,974 --> 00:48:54,309
怎么啦？
Are you okay?

450
00:49:26,132 --> 00:49:27,258
小梅

451
00:49:27,884 --> 00:49:29,135
妳困啦
Sleepy?

452
00:49:29,952 --> 00:49:31,988
早跟妳说过的嘛
I told you. Wanna go to Nanny's?

453
00:49:31,988 --> 00:49:34,025
要不要先到婆婆家去睡一下？
I told you. Wanna go to Nanny's?

454
00:49:35,992 --> 00:49:37,948
爸爸就快到了　撑著点啊
It won't be much longer. Hang in there.

455
00:49:44,272 --> 00:49:46,945
公车怎么这么慢？
It's late…

456
00:49:54,536 --> 00:49:55,537
来
Come on.

457
00:51:19,192 --> 00:51:20,246
大龙猫？
Are you Totoro?

458
00:51:30,432 --> 00:51:32,229
等我一下
Wait a minute.

459
00:51:37,889 --> 00:51:39,186
这个借你
You can use this.

460
00:51:40,552 --> 00:51:42,686
快点啊　小梅快要掉下来了啦
Take it, Mei's slipping off.

461
00:51:49,025 --> 00:51:50,694
要这样子用
Hold it like this.

462
00:53:07,645 --> 00:53:08,855
公车来了！
Here's the bus!

463
00:54:16,392 --> 00:54:20,067
大龙猫　把爸爸的伞给带走了
He took Daddy's umbrella…

464
00:54:33,231 --> 00:54:34,774
对不起，对不起
I'm sorry.

465
00:54:34,752 --> 00:54:35,859
开车
All right, drive on.

466
00:54:36,592 --> 00:54:38,290
爸爸没搭上电车
The train was late and I missed the bus.

467
00:54:38,290 --> 00:54:39,988
所以就没赶上平常那班公车
The train was late and I missed the bus.

468
00:54:40,432 --> 00:54:42,150
害妳们担心啦
Were you worried?

469
00:54:42,741 --> 00:54:45,076
出现了，爸爸　真的出现了耶
We met him, Dad! He was here!

470
00:54:45,072 --> 00:54:46,745
对呀，还有猫的公车
And the Cat Bus!

471
00:54:47,232 --> 00:54:48,301
What?

472
00:54:48,552 --> 00:54:50,248
那辆公车好大哦
It was huge!

473
00:54:50,392 --> 00:54:52,348
眼睛像这样子哦
With big eyes like these!

474
00:54:52,348 --> 00:54:54,305
吓死人了
With big eyes like these!

475
00:54:55,272 --> 00:54:59,424
看到了！　我看到大龙猫了！
We met him! We met Totoro!

476
00:54:59,924 --> 00:55:00,946
好棒哦
How wonderful!

477
00:55:00,946 --> 00:55:01,968
好吓人哦
How wonderful!

478
00:55:22,552 --> 00:55:24,446
妈妈
Dear Mother, I can't tell you how excited I was today.

479
00:55:24,446 --> 00:55:26,340
我现在　心里还在蹦蹦乱跳呢
Dear Mother, I can't tell you how excited I was today.

480
00:55:26,493 --> 00:55:31,188
今天真是既吓人又惊奇　又开心的一天
It was the scariest, funniest day I've ever had.

481
00:55:30,580 --> 00:55:33,708
而且大龙猫送给我们的礼物　实在是太棒了
Totoro gave us a lovely present…

482
00:55:33,992 --> 00:55:36,148
是一个用竹叶包著
…wrapped in bamboo leaves and tied with dragon whiskers.

483
00:55:36,148 --> 00:55:38,304
然后外面再用　龙的胡须绑著的小包包
…wrapped in bamboo leaves and tied with dragon whiskers.

484
00:55:38,463 --> 00:55:40,965
我跟小梅回家以后打开一看
When we opened it, it was full of magic nuts and seeds!

485
00:55:40,965 --> 00:55:43,468
发现里面都是橡果子耶
When we opened it, it was full of magic nuts and seeds!

486
00:55:48,181 --> 00:55:50,208
我们想家里院子　变成森林的话一定很棒
We decided to plant them in the garden to make a lovely forest.

487
00:55:50,208 --> 00:55:52,235
所以就把它们洒在院子里
We decided to plant them in the garden to make a lovely forest.

488
00:55:52,235 --> 00:55:54,262
不过
We decided to plant them in the garden to make a lovely forest.

489
00:55:54,354 --> 00:55:56,606
它们现在都还没有发芽
But they haven't sprouted yet. Mei sits there all day, waiting for them.

490
00:55:56,606 --> 00:55:58,858
所以小梅每天都一直在说
But they haven't sprouted yet. Mei sits there all day, waiting for them.

491
00:55:58,858 --> 00:56:01,111
还没发芽，还没发芽
But they haven't sprouted yet. Mei sits there all day, waiting for them.

492
00:56:02,195 --> 00:56:05,824
就好像猴子螃蟹大战　里面那个螃蟹一样哦
She looks like a little crab.

493
00:56:10,870 --> 00:56:12,622
学校很快就要放暑假了
It's nearly summer vacation.

494
00:56:12,747 --> 00:56:14,928
希望妈妈的病　能够快点好起来好吗？
Dearest, dear Mom, get well soon. Love, Satsuki.

495
00:56:14,928 --> 00:56:17,109
小月
Dearest, dear Mom, get well soon. Love, Satsuki.

496
00:56:26,428 --> 00:56:27,345
要关灯了
Lights off!

497
00:56:27,432 --> 00:56:28,972
等等
Wait, Dad.

498
00:56:29,347 --> 00:56:32,185
爸爸，明天会不会发芽？
Daddy, do you think they will sprout tomorrow?

499
00:56:32,392 --> 00:56:34,129
这个问题呀
Well, I'm sure Totoro would know. Night night.

500
00:56:34,129 --> 00:56:35,867
我看要问大龙猫才会知道啰
Well, I'm sure Totoro would know. Night night.

501
00:56:35,867 --> 00:56:37,605
晚安
Well, I'm sure Totoro would know. Night night.

502
00:57:26,446 --> 00:57:27,822
小梅
Mei!

503
00:57:45,752 --> 00:57:47,634
那是我们种橡果子的地方
That's where we planted the seeds.

504
00:59:19,992 --> 00:59:22,270
太棒了！
Wow, we did it!

505
01:00:37,752 --> 01:00:40,550
小梅，我们都变成风了耶
We're the wind!

506
01:01:41,368 --> 01:01:43,036
大树不见了
There are no trees!

507
01:01:47,912 --> 01:01:49,743
成功了！
Yessss!

508
01:01:52,872 --> 01:01:53,880
好像在作梦
It was a dream.

509
01:01:53,992 --> 01:01:55,145
却又不是梦
But it wasn't a dream.

510
01:01:55,145 --> 01:01:56,299
好像在作梦
But it wasn't a dream.

511
01:01:56,424 --> 01:01:57,801
却又不是梦

512
01:01:57,832 --> 01:01:59,401
万岁！
We did it!

513
01:01:59,401 --> 01:02:00,970
好耶！
We did it!

514
01:02:17,529 --> 01:02:20,281
草壁先生在吗？电报
Mr. Kusakabe! Telegram!

515
01:02:20,281 --> 01:02:23,034
草壁先生在家吗？
Mr. Kusakabe! Telegram!

516
01:02:24,035 --> 01:02:25,537
有您的电报

517
01:02:27,497 --> 01:02:29,207
没人在家啊
Anyone home?

518
01:02:35,872 --> 01:02:38,258
婆婆
Nanny

519
01:02:42,387 --> 01:02:43,888
我在这儿
I'm here.

520
01:02:45,765 --> 01:02:47,892
长成这个样就能吃了
This one is ripe.

521
01:02:57,027 --> 01:02:58,511
婆婆，那这个呢？
What about this one?

522
01:02:58,611 --> 01:03:00,065
可以
That's good, too.

523
01:03:06,312 --> 01:03:09,539
婆婆妳的这块田　好像是一座宝山哦
Your garden's a treasure house.

524
01:03:10,152 --> 01:03:12,586
来，休息一下喘口气
Let's take a little break.

525
01:03:18,631 --> 01:03:21,384
已经冰透了
These should be cold now.

526
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:23,391
那我要吃了
Looks delicious.

527
01:03:32,752 --> 01:03:34,105
好好吃哦
So good.

528
01:03:34,232 --> 01:03:36,191
真的呀
The sun blessed these so they're really good for you.

529
01:03:36,191 --> 01:03:38,151
这是因为太阳晒得够多
The sun blessed these so they're really good for you.

530
01:03:38,151 --> 01:03:40,111
对身体非常健康的啊
The sun blessed these so they're really good for you.

531
01:03:40,528 --> 01:03:42,405
对妈妈的身体也有益吗？
Would they help my Mom, too?

532
01:03:42,530 --> 01:03:44,175
当然啦
Of course. If she eats my vegetables, she'll get better right away.

533
01:03:44,175 --> 01:03:45,821
只要是　吃了婆婆田里种的东西
Of course. If she eats my vegetables, she'll get better right away.

534
01:03:45,821 --> 01:03:47,467
身体就会好啦
Of course. If she eats my vegetables, she'll get better right away.

535
01:03:47,869 --> 01:03:50,506
这个星期六　我妈妈就会回来了
She's supposed to be back next Saturday.

536
01:03:50,622 --> 01:03:52,708
妈妈要跟我一起睡觉哦
She'll sleep in my bed!

537
01:03:53,416 --> 01:03:56,127
是吗？　马上就要出院了
At last. That's wonderful.

538
01:03:56,232 --> 01:03:58,505
不算是真正的出院
But it's only for a couple of days. To get used to the new house.

539
01:03:58,505 --> 01:04:00,778
星期一还得回去复诊
But it's only for a couple of days. To get used to the new house.

540
01:04:00,778 --> 01:04:03,051
还没有那么快好
But it's only for a couple of days. To get used to the new house.

541
01:04:03,232 --> 01:04:05,247
这样吗？
I see. We'll feed her lots of vegetables, then.

542
01:04:05,247 --> 01:04:07,263
那可要多吃点东西补一补了
I see. We'll feed her lots of vegetables, then.

543
01:04:07,389 --> 01:04:10,868
我要把我自己摘的　玉蜀黍给妈妈吃
I'll give her this corn I picked.

544
01:04:11,032 --> 01:04:13,186
那她一定会很高兴的
I'm sure she'll be very pleased.

545
01:04:13,392 --> 01:04:14,871
Yes!

546
01:04:22,487 --> 01:04:23,529

There was a telegram for you.

547
01:04:23,529 --> 01:04:24,572
你们不在　所以邮差送去我家
There was a telegram for you.

548
01:04:24,698 --> 01:04:25,622

For us?

549
01:04:29,869 --> 01:04:32,163
婆婆　我爸爸不到傍晚不回来耶
Dad won't be back till late, what shall I do?

550
01:04:32,664 --> 01:04:35,166
快打开看吧　要是急事耽搁就不好了
Open it, it might be important.

551
01:04:39,112 --> 01:04:43,133

555
01:04:50,598 --> 01:04:52,684
婆婆，怎么办？　医院要我们跟他们联络
Nanny! What shall I do?

556
01:04:52,809 --> 01:04:54,832
妳别紧张，冷静一点
Calm down. Do you know where your Dad is?

557
01:04:54,832 --> 01:04:56,855
知不知道爸爸上班的地方？
Calm down. Do you know where your Dad is?

558
01:04:57,022 --> 01:04:58,606
爸爸研究室的电话号码　我是知道
I know his office number, but we don't have a telephone.

559
01:04:58,606 --> 01:05:00,191
可是没有电话可打呀
I know his office number, but we don't have a telephone.

560
01:05:00,316 --> 01:05:04,571
勘太　你带小月去打电话
Kanta, take her to use the phone in the main house!

561
01:05:09,743 --> 01:05:12,824
小梅，妳留下来陪婆婆

562
01:05:21,838 --> 01:05:23,783
小梅，妳回去婆婆那里
Stay with Nanny, Mei!

563
01:06:01,192 --> 01:06:03,945

572
01:06:34,072 --> 01:06:37,494
怎么了？
Hello, what's up? From the hospital?

573
01:06:37,494 --> 01:06:40,917
医院来电报？我知道了
Hello, what's up? From the hospital?

574
01:06:40,072 --> 01:06:42,711
爸爸现在就打电话到医院去问
Okay, I'll call them right away.

575
01:06:42,794 --> 01:06:44,249
是不是妈妈出事了？
Is there anything wrong with Mom?

576
01:06:44,249 --> 01:06:45,705
怎么办呀？爸爸
Is there anything wrong with Mom?

577
01:06:45,797 --> 01:06:47,952
不会有事的
Don't worry. I'll check and call you right back.

578
01:06:47,952 --> 01:06:50,107
爸爸给医院打过电话　就马上就回妳电话

我爸爸还会打电话来
May I stay here until he calls back?

583
01:07:01,855 --> 01:07:04,149
没关系，慢慢来
Stay as long as you like.

584
01:07:11,552 --> 01:07:13,658
姊姊
Satsuki!

585
01:07:22,272 --> 01:07:24,096
不可以啦
No, this corn is for my Mommy!

586
01:07:24,096 --> 01:07:25,920
这个是要给妈妈的玉蜀黍
No, this corn is for my Mommy!

587
01:07:27,032 --> 01:07:28,687
不可以！
No, it's my Mom's!

588
01:07:28,687 --> 01:07:30,342
这个是要给妈妈的啦
No, it's my Mom's!

589
01:07:46,392 --> 01:07:48,452
小梅
Listen Mei. Mom's not well so she's not coming home this time.

590
01:07:48,452 --> 01:07:50,512
爸爸说妈妈的病又有点恶化了
Listen Mei. Mom's not well so she's not coming home this time.

591
01:07:50,512 --> 01:07:52,572
所以这个礼拜妈妈不能回家了
Listen Mei. Mom's not well so she's not coming home this time.

592
01:07:53,072 --> 01:07:54,266
我不要！
No!

593
01:07:55,432 --> 01:07:57,269
妳不要也不行啊
There's nothing we can do. You don't want her to get worse, do you?

594
01:07:57,269 --> 01:07:59,107
妈妈要是勉强出院　反而更严重了那怎么办？
There's nothing we can do. You don't want her to get worse, do you?

595
01:07:59,392 --> 01:08:00,871
我不要！
No!

596
01:08:02,112 --> 01:08:04,250
不过是晚几天而已
It's just for a few more days.

597
01:08:04,542 --> 01:08:05,960
我不要！

598
01:08:07,462 --> 01:08:09,547
那妈妈死掉　也没有关系是不是？
So you don't care if she dies, do you?

599
01:08:09,881 --> 01:08:11,549
不要！

600
01:08:12,072 --> 01:08:13,291
妳这个大笨蛋！
Stop being silly! I'm going.

601
01:08:13,291 --> 01:08:14,511
我不管妳了！
Stop being silly! I'm going.

602
01:08:25,552 --> 01:08:26,564
走吧
Let's go, Mei.

603
01:08:30,152 --> 01:08:33,738
姊姊大坏蛋！
I hate you, Satsuki!

604
01:09:00,512 --> 01:09:04,300
衣服该收收了
We should bring the washing in…

605
01:09:04,811 --> 01:09:07,091
别这么沮丧嘛
Don't worry too much, Satsuki. Nanny's here to help, so cheer up.

606
01:09:07,091 --> 01:09:09,371
婆婆不是过来帮忙了吗？
Don't worry too much, Satsuki. Nanny's here to help, so cheer up.

607
01:09:09,371 --> 01:09:11,651
打起精神
Don't worry too much, Satsuki. Nanny's here to help, so cheer up.

608
01:09:15,512 --> 01:09:19,868
妳爸爸说他今天　要留在医院过夜
Your Dad said he'll stop by the hospital to check on her.

609
01:09:20,312 --> 01:09:23,731
妳妈妈不过是感冒而已
Besides, it's just a cold; she'll be back next week.

610
01:09:23,731 --> 01:09:27,150
下个星期六一定会回来的
Besides, it's just a cold; she'll be back next week.

611
01:09:31,512 --> 01:09:33,406
之前也是这样
They said it was just a cold…

612
01:09:33,406 --> 01:09:35,300
医生说只要住数天就会好了
They said it was just a cold…

613
01:09:36,192 --> 01:09:37,927
而且那次也是说得了感冒
when she went into hospital.

614
01:09:39,512 --> 01:09:41,431
我妈妈要是死了该怎么办？
But what if she dies!

615
01:09:41,592 --> 01:09:43,892
小月
Don't be silly, Satsuki.

616
01:09:44,017 --> 01:09:46,347
我妈妈要是死了那我们⋯
Maybe Mom will…

617
01:09:49,792 --> 01:09:53,494
妳放心，不要乱想
Stop it. Nobody would leave two pretty little girls like you.

618
01:09:53,494 --> 01:09:57,197
妳妈妈哪舍得下　妳们这些可爱的孩子
Stop it. Nobody would leave two pretty little girls like you.

619
01:09:57,697 --> 01:10:01,307
别哭了，别哭了
There, there. Don't cry.

620
01:10:01,368 --> 01:10:03,857
在妳爸爸回来之前
I'll be here until Daddy comes back, okay?

621
01:10:03,857 --> 01:10:06,347
婆婆都会陪著妳的　好不好呀？
I'll be here until Daddy comes back, okay?

622
01:10:48,164 --> 01:10:51,383
小梅呀
Mei!

623
01:10:55,630 --> 01:10:57,549
小梅
Mei!

624
01:11:00,472 --> 01:11:02,702
小梅
Mei!

625
01:11:05,592 --> 01:11:06,725
小梅回来了没？
Did she come back?

626
01:11:06,872 --> 01:11:09,466
没在公车站牌那边吗？
Wasn't she at the bus stop?

627
01:11:10,672 --> 01:11:12,389
这就奇怪了
That's strange. Where has she gone?

628
01:11:12,389 --> 01:11:14,107
她会跑到哪里去了？
That's strange. Where has she gone?

629
01:11:14,232 --> 01:11:15,963
我刚刚跟小梅吵了一架
I was nasty to her, 'cause she was being silly…

630
01:11:15,963 --> 01:11:17,694
因为她⋯
I was nasty to her, 'cause she was being silly…

631
01:11:18,028 --> 01:11:20,739
她会不会　跑去妈妈住的医院了？
Maybe she's heading for the hospital!

632
01:11:20,905 --> 01:11:23,866
七国山医院去了呀
The hospital? It would take a grown-up three hours!

633
01:11:23,866 --> 01:11:26,828
可是就连大人也得　走上三个钟头才会到
The hospital? It would take a grown-up three hours!

634
01:11:26,953 --> 01:11:27,748
我去看看
I'll go look!

635
01:11:29,312 --> 01:11:32,845
勘太　快点去叫你爸爸回来
Kanta, hurry! Tell your dad that Mei is missing!

636
01:11:32,845 --> 01:11:36,379
小梅不见了
Kanta, hurry! Tell your dad that Mei is missing!

637
01:11:45,432 --> 01:11:48,185
小梅真是笨蛋　不知道路又爱乱跑
Stupid Mei. Always getting lost.

638
01:11:55,940 --> 01:11:58,318
小梅
Mei!

639
01:12:05,200 --> 01:12:07,308
打搅了，伯伯，请问⋯
Excuse me.

640
01:12:09,162 --> 01:12:11,393
您有没有看见束辫子的小女孩　从这条路经过？
Have you seen a little girl pass by? She's my sister.

641
01:12:11,393 --> 01:12:13,625
她是我妹妹
Have you seen a little girl pass by? She's my sister.

642
01:12:13,792 --> 01:12:16,471
这个嘛⋯小女孩啊
No, I don't think so. I'm sure I would've noticed…

643
01:12:16,471 --> 01:12:19,150
没什么印象耶
No, I don't think so. I'm sure I would've noticed…

644
01:12:20,131 --> 01:12:21,925
她会不会没往这边来？
Maybe she wasn't here.

645
01:12:41,277 --> 01:12:43,363
妳确定她是往这边来的？
Are you sure she came this way?

646
01:12:43,472 --> 01:12:45,190
我也不知道
I don't know.

647
01:12:53,312 --> 01:12:55,917
小梅
Mei!

648
01:13:16,872 --> 01:13:18,732
停车！
Please, stop!

649
01:13:21,276 --> 01:13:22,527
搞什么啊！危险啊
Jerk! What are you doing?!

650
01:13:22,592 --> 01:13:24,165
我在找我妹妹
I'm looking for my sister. Have you seen a little girl?

651
01:13:24,165 --> 01:13:25,739
你们有没有看到一个小女孩？
I'm looking for my sister. Have you seen a little girl?

652
01:13:26,364 --> 01:13:27,507
妳妹妹？
Your little sister?

653
01:13:27,866 --> 01:13:29,742
她好像是往七国山医院去了
She's four. I think she's heading to the hospital.

654
01:13:29,742 --> 01:13:31,619
她是一个四岁的小女孩
She's four. I think she's heading to the hospital.

655
01:13:32,032 --> 01:13:33,371
良子啊，妳刚才有没有看到？
Did you see anyone?

656
01:13:33,432 --> 01:13:36,238
我们两个　就是从那个方向来的
No. We just came from there… but we didn't see anyone.

657
01:13:36,238 --> 01:13:39,044
不过　好像没有看到那样的小孩耶
No. We just came from there… but we didn't see anyone.

658
01:13:40,045 --> 01:13:41,838
谢谢你们
Thanks anyway.

659
01:13:42,912 --> 01:13:44,674
妳从哪里来的？
Where have you come from?

660
01:13:44,712 --> 01:13:46,111
松乡
From Matsugo.

661
01:13:45,967 --> 01:13:47,302
松乡！？

662
01:13:47,752 --> 01:13:49,471
会不会搞错了呀？
Really?

663
01:13:50,792 --> 01:13:52,191
再见啰
Good luck.

664
01:14:03,472 --> 01:14:05,153
小月
Satsuki!

665
01:14:06,472 --> 01:14:08,907
勘太
Kanta!

666
01:14:09,512 --> 01:14:10,533
怎么样？
Find her?

667
01:14:10,552 --> 01:14:12,369
没看到，那妳呢？
No. And you?

668
01:14:13,112 --> 01:14:15,305
现在我爸爸他们也去找了
Dad and the others are looking for her. I'll go to the hospital,

669
01:14:15,305 --> 01:14:17,499
我去往七国山的路上看看
Dad and the others are looking for her. I'll go to the hospital,

670
01:14:17,624 --> 01:14:19,230
妳先回家去
you go back home.

671
01:14:19,472 --> 01:14:20,788
我想小梅一定是想去医院
I guess she got lost on the way to the hospital.

672
01:14:20,788 --> 01:14:22,104
可是却走错路了
I guess she got lost on the way to the hospital.

673
01:14:22,104 --> 01:14:23,421
一定是
I guess she got lost on the way to the hospital.

674
01:14:23,672 --> 01:14:26,716
刚才有人在神池　发现一只小孩的凉鞋
They found a sandal by the pond.

675
01:14:33,752 --> 01:14:36,585
不过还不确定　那就是小梅的鞋子
We're not sure if it's hers or not!

676
01:14:53,752 --> 01:14:55,504
找到了没？
Did you find her?

677
01:15:26,792 --> 01:15:31,489
喃呒阿弥陀佛
Dear Lord, please protect her and…

678
01:15:31,592 --> 01:15:34,034
池那边泥比较深一点　从那边开始啊
It's too deep here, better search further away!

679
01:15:34,072 --> 01:15:36,286
递根竹竿给我！
Hey, are there any poles left?

680
01:15:44,952 --> 01:15:47,172
婆婆，小月来了
Grandma, Satsuki's here!

681
01:15:51,752 --> 01:15:53,595
婆婆
Nanny!

682
01:15:54,592 --> 01:15:56,639
妳看看这个
Look, is it hers?

683
01:16:05,752 --> 01:16:06,858
不是小梅的
No, it isn't.

684
01:16:17,552 --> 01:16:20,359
太好了
Thank heavens, I was sure it was hers.

685
01:16:20,359 --> 01:16:23,166
我还以为　这是小梅的了
Thank heavens, I was sure it was hers.

686
01:16:23,272 --> 01:16:25,991
婆婆就爱穷紧张
Hey, Nanny was jumping to conclusions.

687
01:16:25,293 --> 01:16:27,671
虚惊一场啊
It's not hers!

688
01:16:27,832 --> 01:16:29,798
那孩子到底跑哪去了？
Where's she gone then?

689
01:16:29,832 --> 01:16:31,383
再去四处找找
Let's start from scratch.

690
01:16:31,508 --> 01:16:33,134
快点啊，天要黑了
We better hurry, it'll be dark soon.

691
01:16:33,152 --> 01:16:35,166
不好意思啊
I really appreciate your help, everyone.

692
01:16:35,166 --> 01:16:37,180
大家辛苦你们　再回头去找找好了
I really appreciate your help, everyone.

693
01:16:36,992 --> 01:16:39,062
Don't worry. Could have been any of us.

694
01:17:06,992 --> 01:17:08,602
求求你们
Please, help me Totoro!

695
01:17:08,602 --> 01:17:10,213
把我带去龙猫那里
Please, help me Totoro!

696
01:17:10,232 --> 01:17:12,227
我的妹妹走丢了
Mei is lost. It'll be dark soon. I'm sure she's scared somewhere…

697
01:17:12,227 --> 01:17:14,223
不久天就要黑了
Mei is lost. It'll be dark soon. I'm sure she's scared somewhere…

698
01:17:14,223 --> 01:17:16,219
她一定在哪里迷了路
Mei is lost. It'll be dark soon. I'm sure she's scared somewhere…

699
01:17:46,872 --> 01:17:48,168
大龙猫？
Totoro!

700
01:17:49,992 --> 01:17:51,344
大龙猫
Mei is lost and we can't find her!

701
01:17:51,344 --> 01:17:52,696
我妹妹小梅走丢了
Mei is lost and we can't find her!

702
01:17:52,696 --> 01:17:54,049
我找了好久都找不到
Mei is lost and we can't find her!

703
01:17:54,632 --> 01:17:57,364
求求你，帮我找小梅好不好？
She must be scared, please help me find her.

704
01:17:57,364 --> 01:18:00,096
她一定已经吓哭了
She must be scared, please help me find her.

705
01:18:01,312 --> 01:18:03,826
我现在不知道该怎么办好
I don't know what to do…

706
01:19:02,472 --> 01:19:04,160
大家都看不到牠
They can't see the bus.

707
01:19:51,752 --> 01:19:54,141
FOREST—SWAMP

708
01:19:54,352 --> 01:19:56,661

（小梅）
MEI

710
01:20:15,752 --> 01:20:18,360
小梅
Mei!

711
01:20:27,827 --> 01:20:29,245
树林开出了一条路了
The trees are moving out of the way!

712
01:21:00,944 --> 01:21:03,113
小梅

713
01:21:06,352 --> 01:21:08,785
姊姊
Satsuki!

714
01:21:10,495 --> 01:21:12,122
姊姊

715
01:21:12,247 --> 01:21:13,915
小梅

716
01:21:23,392 --> 01:21:24,384
小梅
Mei!

717
01:21:24,509 --> 01:21:26,219
姊姊

718
01:21:29,032 --> 01:21:30,265
妳这个傻瓜
You silly girl.

719
01:21:30,272 --> 01:21:32,183
对不起
I'm sorry.

720
01:21:34,672 --> 01:21:38,148
妳是不是想要把玉蜀黍　送去医院给妈妈？
You wanted to take the corn to Mom?

721
01:21:45,832 --> 01:21:48,450
（七国山医院）
HOSPITAL

722
01:21:49,952 --> 01:21:52,162
你要送我们去医院吗？
Will you take us to the hospital?

723
01:21:54,392 --> 01:21:56,166
谢谢你
Thank you so much.

724
01:22:05,050 --> 01:22:07,385
对不起，只不过是感冒
I'm sorry. They didn't need to send a telegram just for a cold.

725
01:22:07,385 --> 01:22:09,721
医院就擅自决定　发电报给家里了
I'm sorry. They didn't need to send a telegram just for a cold.

726
01:22:09,992 --> 01:22:12,254
那两个孩子一定都很担心我吧
The girls must be worried. I'm sorry to upset them.

727
01:22:12,254 --> 01:22:14,517
真是苦了她们了
The girls must be worried. I'm sorry to upset them.

728
01:22:14,752 --> 01:22:17,437
她们知道妳平安就会安心的
They'll be fine. As long as you're okay.

729
01:22:17,472 --> 01:22:19,212
这些年来我们一家四口
We've all learned to cope. This'll just postpone the enjoyment.

730
01:22:19,212 --> 01:22:20,952
不都这样努力过来的吗？
We've all learned to cope. This'll just postpone the enjoyment.

731
01:22:20,952 --> 01:22:22,692
享福之前总得吃点苦啊
We've all learned to cope. This'll just postpone the enjoyment.

732
01:22:24,110 --> 01:22:27,697
她们表面好像没事　可是心里一定很难过
They've put up with it so well.

733
01:22:27,832 --> 01:22:30,867
小月越是懂事　就越教人于心不忍
I'm especially sorry for Satsuki, she's been so patient.

734
01:22:31,992 --> 01:22:33,161
是啊
You're right.

735
01:22:33,872 --> 01:22:37,916
出院以后我要好好疼疼她们　让她们尽情耍耍小脾气
I'm going to spoil them for a while when I come home.

736
01:22:38,041 --> 01:22:39,000
妳呀
Oh no!

737
01:22:46,392 --> 01:22:48,343
妈妈在笑耶
She's laughing!

738
01:22:48,352 --> 01:22:50,220
看样子是没事了
Looks like she's fine.

739
01:22:58,352 --> 01:23:01,264
我得赶快把身体养好才行
I can't wait to get back on my feet.

740
01:23:01,022 --> 01:23:02,107
是啊

741
01:23:03,152 --> 01:23:04,028
Look.

742
01:23:10,432 --> 01:23:12,075
是谁摆的啊？
Where did that come from?

743
01:23:13,952 --> 01:23:14,911
怎么啦？
What?

744
01:23:15,552 --> 01:23:19,249
我好像看到小月和小梅　坐在那棵松树上笑
I could swear I just saw Satsuki and Mei laughing up in that tree.

745
01:23:22,152 --> 01:23:24,029
搞不好是真的也说不定哦
Maybe they were too. Look.

746
01:23:23,962 --> 01:23:24,671
妳看
