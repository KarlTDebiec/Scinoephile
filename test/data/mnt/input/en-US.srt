1
00:00:30,872 --> 00:00:32,828
<i>Hey, let's go</i>

2
00:00:32,989 --> 00:00:34,945
<i>Hey, let's go</i>

3
00:00:35,112 --> 00:00:38,866
<i>I'm happy as can be</i>

4
00:00:39,032 --> 00:00:42,741
<i>Let's go walking you and me</i>

5
00:00:42,912 --> 00:00:45,267
<i>Ready, set, come on, let's go</i>

6
00:00:47,032 --> 00:00:50,786
<i>Over the hill, across the field</i>

7
00:00:50,952 --> 00:00:54,581
<i>Through the tunnel we'll go</i>

8
00:00:54,752 --> 00:00:58,062
<i>We'll run across the bridge</i>

9
00:00:58,232 --> 00:01:02,589
<i>And down the bumpy gravel road</i>

10
00:01:02,752 --> 00:01:06,347
<i>Right beneath the spider's web</i>

11
00:01:06,512 --> 00:01:09,470
<i>Ready, set, let's go</i>

12
00:01:18,952 --> 00:01:20,891
<i>Hey, let's go</i>

13
00:01:21,052 --> 00:01:22,991
<i>Hey, let's go</i>

14
00:01:23,152 --> 00:01:26,906
<i>I'm happy as can be</i>

15
00:01:27,072 --> 00:01:30,747
<i>Let‘s go walking you and me</i>

16
00:01:30,912 --> 00:01:33,472
<i>Ready, set, come on, let's go</i>

17
00:01:34,872 --> 00:01:38,706
<i>The foxes and the badgers, too</i>

18
00:01:38,872 --> 00:01:42,626
<i>All come out to play</i>

19
00:01:42,792 --> 00:01:46,102
<i>They all want to explore</i>

20
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:50,709
<i>The deep and wonderful woods all day</i>

21
00:01:50,912 --> 00:01:54,348
<i>Look at all my many friends</i>

22
00:01:54,472 --> 00:01:57,464
<i>Ready, set, let's go</i>

23
00:01:59,112 --> 00:02:02,422
<i>Look at all my many friends</i><i></i>

24
00:02:02,632 --> 00:02:05,669
<i>Ready, set, let's go</i><i></i>

25
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:33,904
Dad, do you want a caramel?

26
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:36,865
Thanks. Aren't you tired?

27
00:02:37,072 --> 00:02:37,584
All right.

28
00:02:37,912 --> 00:02:38,981
We're almost there.

29
00:02:50,472 --> 00:02:51,382
Mei, hide!

30
00:02:57,632 --> 00:02:59,190
It wasn't a policeman.

31
00:03:32,152 --> 00:03:34,871
Hello. Are your parents around?

32
00:03:36,992 --> 00:03:38,311
Thanks.

33
00:03:40,312 --> 00:03:44,351
I'm Kusakabe! We've just arrived!

34
00:03:45,152 --> 00:03:47,302
A pleasure to meet you!

35
00:03:47,472 --> 00:03:49,110
Welcome!

36
00:03:54,232 --> 00:03:55,904
Thank you.

37
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:18,462
Here we are!

38
00:04:19,872 --> 00:04:21,703
Wait!

39
00:04:24,712 --> 00:04:26,065
Mei, there's a bridge!

40
00:04:26,312 --> 00:04:27,267
A bridge?

41
00:04:32,392 --> 00:04:34,781
See that flash? Fish too!

42
00:04:35,632 --> 00:04:37,384
So, you like it here?

43
00:04:40,032 --> 00:04:42,182
Dad, it's terrific!

44
00:04:42,352 --> 00:04:43,990
Look, a tunnel of trees!

45
00:04:46,232 --> 00:04:48,587
Is that our house?

46
00:04:52,712 --> 00:04:54,430
Come on!

47
00:05:07,352 --> 00:05:09,183
It's a wreck!

48
00:05:09,352 --> 00:05:10,751
Wreck!

49
00:05:10,992 --> 00:05:12,345
Looks like a haunted house!

50
00:05:12,512 --> 00:05:13,342
Haunted?

51
00:05:21,272 --> 00:05:22,341
And it's all rotten!

52
00:05:34,192 --> 00:05:35,671
It's gonna fall down!

53
00:05:35,832 --> 00:05:37,504
Fall down!

54
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:49,303
Look, Mei!

55
00:05:51,672 --> 00:05:52,900
See?

56
00:06:02,192 --> 00:06:03,784
It's huge.

57
00:06:09,312 --> 00:06:11,906
Dad, there's a huge tree!

58
00:06:12,632 --> 00:06:14,350
It's a camphor tree.

59
00:06:16,472 --> 00:06:18,428
Camphor tree...

60
00:06:27,712 --> 00:06:28,622
Oops!

61
00:06:31,512 --> 00:06:32,308
An acorn!

62
00:06:34,072 --> 00:06:35,744
Show me.

63
00:06:37,472 --> 00:06:38,791
Another one!

64
00:06:43,952 --> 00:06:46,420
One for me!

65
00:06:52,432 --> 00:06:54,900
Out of the way. I can't open the screens.

66
00:06:55,552 --> 00:06:56,507
Acorns!

67
00:06:56,712 --> 00:06:59,067
There's acorns in the house.

68
00:06:59,232 --> 00:07:00,631
They dropped from up there!

69
00:07:05,352 --> 00:07:08,264
Maybe there are squirrels in here.

70
00:07:08,512 --> 00:07:10,184
Squirrels, really?

71
00:07:10,832 --> 00:07:13,062
Or rats that like acorns.

72
00:07:14,152 --> 00:07:15,631
I'd rather have squirrels!

73
00:07:16,312 --> 00:07:18,268
Where shall I put this?

74
00:07:18,872 --> 00:07:23,468
Here, I'll get the door for you. Satsuki, open up the kitchen.

75
00:07:24,112 --> 00:07:25,511
It's just round the back.

76
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:29,266
Mei, come on!

77
00:07:30,672 --> 00:07:32,264
Wait for me!

78
00:07:33,632 --> 00:07:35,384
Hurry!

79
00:08:13,512 --> 00:08:14,581
Ready?

80
00:08:26,992 --> 00:08:28,266
Bathtubs.

81
00:08:34,312 --> 00:08:35,711
There's nothing here.

82
00:08:37,712 --> 00:08:38,906
That's the bathroom.

83
00:08:39,152 --> 00:08:40,824
Dad, there's something in here.

84
00:08:41,032 --> 00:08:41,748
A squirrel?

85
00:08:41,992 --> 00:08:46,622
Dunno. A bunch of black things but not roaches or mice.

86
00:08:46,872 --> 00:08:48,624
Really?

87
00:09:00,192 --> 00:09:01,261
Can you see 'em?

88
00:09:02,712 --> 00:09:04,430
I think they were... soot gremlins.

89
00:09:04,712 --> 00:09:07,465
'Gremlins'? Like in my picture book?

90
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:10,903
That's right. Ghosts don't come out on days like this.

91
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:18,622
When you walk into a dark room from outside,

92
00:09:19,312 --> 00:09:21,746
your eyes dim and so the dustbunnies come out.

93
00:09:22,272 --> 00:09:23,466
Oh, I see.

94
00:09:23,952 --> 00:09:30,630
Come here, soot gremlins. Come out, come out, wherever you are!

95
00:09:36,072 --> 00:09:40,463
Let's get to work! See if you can find how to get upstairs.

96
00:09:42,352 --> 00:09:44,946
Get up there and open all the windows.

97
00:09:45,552 --> 00:09:46,428
Sure!

98
00:09:46,672 --> 00:09:47,946
I'm coming, too!

99
00:09:56,672 --> 00:09:58,151
Toilet!

100
00:10:00,632 --> 00:10:01,747
Not here!

101
00:10:19,312 --> 00:10:20,301
Nothing here!

102
00:10:20,952 --> 00:10:22,431
Nothing!

103
00:10:32,352 --> 00:10:34,422
Mei, it's here!

104
00:10:40,992 --> 00:10:42,584
It's pitch black!

105
00:10:42,752 --> 00:10:44,424
Soot gremlins...

106
00:10:52,832 --> 00:10:53,981
Another acorn.

107
00:11:00,392 --> 00:11:04,067
Come out, soot gremlins!

108
00:11:43,712 --> 00:11:47,227
Are you there, Mr. Soot Gremlin?

109
00:12:12,792 --> 00:12:16,785
Dad, there's definitely something here!

110
00:12:16,952 --> 00:12:22,948
That's exciting! I've always wanted to live in a haunted house.

111
00:12:25,992 --> 00:12:27,311
I'm coming!

112
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,942
I got it. Satsuki!

113
00:13:28,752 --> 00:13:29,707
Mei.

114
00:13:40,352 --> 00:13:42,183
You're full of energy!

115
00:13:42,592 --> 00:13:46,904
This is 'Nanny'. She looks after the house and came to help.

116
00:13:47,832 --> 00:13:50,824
I'm Satsuki and this is my sister, Mei.

117
00:13:51,112 --> 00:13:53,865
Nice to meet you both.

118
00:13:54,032 --> 00:14:00,426
I'd have cleaned up if I'd known you'd be this quick.

119
00:14:01,032 --> 00:14:02,863
No, you've done plenty.

120
00:14:03,032 --> 00:14:08,311
Lately I've been so busy in the rice paddies, I only did a bit of dusting...

121
00:14:09,752 --> 00:14:12,425
What have you done to your hands?

122
00:14:12,632 --> 00:14:14,702
The soot gremlin got away...

123
00:14:14,872 --> 00:14:16,988
Your feet, too!

124
00:14:20,992 --> 00:14:22,869
Mine are black, too!

125
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:34,142
That must be the ‘soot sprites'.

126
00:14:34,512 --> 00:14:40,621
Those little, black, fuzzy things that fly?

127
00:14:40,832 --> 00:14:45,303
That's right. They breed in empty old houses,

128
00:14:45,512 --> 00:14:49,027
and cover them with soot and dust.

129
00:14:50,312 --> 00:14:57,627
I could see them when I was little. Now you can too, huh?

130
00:14:57,832 --> 00:14:59,311
Are they like goblins or something?

131
00:14:59,912 --> 00:15:03,905
Naah, nothing so scary.

132
00:15:04,112 --> 00:15:09,266
If you keep smiling, they'll soon leave the house.

133
00:15:11,032 --> 00:15:15,071
They're probably deciding where to go next, right now.

134
00:15:21,112 --> 00:15:22,864
Mei, they're going away.

135
00:15:23,032 --> 00:15:23,862
That's no fun.

136
00:15:24,072 --> 00:15:26,461
What happens if a huge one comes out, like this?

137
00:15:27,072 --> 00:15:28,061
I wouldn't be scared.

138
00:15:28,552 --> 00:15:32,147
Okay then, I won't walk you to the bathroom at night.

139
00:15:34,592 --> 00:15:39,541
Okay, cleaning time. Could you get some water from the stream?

140
00:15:39,712 --> 00:15:40,747
From the stream?

141
00:15:40,992 --> 00:15:42,027
I'm coming, too!

142
00:15:45,792 --> 00:15:47,350
Mei, wait there.

143
00:15:56,872 --> 00:15:58,783
Did you get a fish?

144
00:16:10,432 --> 00:16:12,263
Nanny, it's coming out!

145
00:16:12,872 --> 00:16:17,263
Good, keep pumping 'til the water gets cold.

146
00:16:17,752 --> 00:16:18,980
Okay!

147
00:17:01,192 --> 00:17:04,070
May I help you?

148
00:17:05,432 --> 00:17:08,071
Huh... my Mom... for Granny.

149
00:17:10,192 --> 00:17:11,102
Yes?

150
00:17:17,352 --> 00:17:19,070
Wait, what is it?

151
00:17:20,112 --> 00:17:21,784
Is that you, Kanta?

152
00:17:23,512 --> 00:17:28,825
You live in a haunted house!

153
00:17:29,112 --> 00:17:30,147
Kanta, stop it!

154
00:17:40,672 --> 00:17:43,232
I did the same when I was his age.

155
00:17:43,832 --> 00:17:48,826
I hate boys. But I really love Nanny's rice cakes!

156
00:17:49,272 --> 00:17:51,228
Eat as much as you want.

157
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:53,386
Thank you!

158
00:17:56,432 --> 00:17:58,184
Thank you very much for your help.

159
00:17:59,672 --> 00:18:01,822
Good bye!

160
00:19:16,392 --> 00:19:19,384
Dad, the house is going to fall down.

161
00:19:21,752 --> 00:19:24,585
I hope not; we've only just moved in.

162
00:19:59,752 --> 00:20:03,062
Come on, let's laugh to keep the bogeymen away!

163
00:20:05,352 --> 00:20:06,990
I'm not scared.

164
00:20:08,232 --> 00:20:09,904
I mean it. I'm not scared!

165
00:20:54,112 --> 00:20:56,068
One-two, one-two...

166
00:20:57,192 --> 00:21:00,707
Come on, keep up the good work...

167
00:21:06,192 --> 00:21:08,945
Okay! Washing... finished!

168
00:21:18,312 --> 00:21:20,382
Here we go!

169
00:21:37,392 --> 00:21:39,906
Nanny!

170
00:21:40,432 --> 00:21:42,343
Hello!

171
00:21:42,552 --> 00:21:44,190
Hard at work?

172
00:21:44,552 --> 00:21:46,747
Where're you all heading?

173
00:21:47,512 --> 00:21:50,106
To visit Mommy in the hospital!

174
00:21:50,352 --> 00:21:54,982
That's nice. Give her my regards!

175
00:22:13,352 --> 00:22:15,183
This way.

176
00:22:42,232 --> 00:22:43,028
Hello.

177
00:22:43,392 --> 00:22:44,745
Hello there.

178
00:22:46,512 --> 00:22:47,308
Mommy!

179
00:22:47,472 --> 00:22:49,906
So glad you came, my dear.

180
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:52,307
Daddy took the wrong road.

181
00:22:52,472 --> 00:22:55,225
Really? Hello, Satsuki.

182
00:22:55,472 --> 00:22:57,064
It's a school holiday today.

183
00:22:57,272 --> 00:22:58,421
How nice.

184
00:22:58,632 --> 00:23:01,351
Daddy is talking to the doctor.

185
00:23:01,592 --> 00:23:03,423
It's so good to see you all.

186
00:23:03,832 --> 00:23:06,392
Have you settled into the new house?

187
00:23:12,592 --> 00:23:14,310
A haunted house?

188
00:23:14,752 --> 00:23:16,947
Mom, do you like ghosts?

189
00:23:17,312 --> 00:23:20,349
Of course I do! I can't wait to see them.

190
00:23:20,592 --> 00:23:22,150
See, I told you Mei.

191
00:23:23,272 --> 00:23:26,628
Mei was worried that you wouldn't like ghosts.

192
00:23:26,832 --> 00:23:27,981
What about you two?

193
00:23:28,192 --> 00:23:28,988
I love them!

194
00:23:29,232 --> 00:23:30,984
I'm not scared of them!

195
00:23:33,432 --> 00:23:36,071
Are you fixing Mei's hair, Satsuki?

196
00:23:37,232 --> 00:23:39,587
It's really good. Lucky girl, Mei.

197
00:23:41,072 --> 00:23:43,267
But she always gets mad at me.

198
00:23:43,472 --> 00:23:45,030
That's 'cuz you won't stay still.

199
00:23:45,192 --> 00:23:47,148
Come here, Satsuki.

200
00:23:47,792 --> 00:23:49,464
Isn't yours too short?

201
00:23:49,672 --> 00:23:50,787
No, I like it like this.

202
00:23:50,992 --> 00:23:52,823
Do mine, Mommy! Mine, too!

203
00:23:53,032 --> 00:23:53,828
Wait your turn!

204
00:23:54,552 --> 00:23:59,421
Wavy hair, just like mine when I was your age.

205
00:23:59,632 --> 00:24:03,466
Will it be like yours when I grow up?

206
00:24:03,832 --> 00:24:07,381
Probably. You take after your Mom.

207
00:24:25,352 --> 00:24:27,183
Mom looked really well.

208
00:24:27,432 --> 00:24:31,186
You're right.The doctor says she'll be home soon.

209
00:24:31,792 --> 00:24:33,510
Soon? Like tomorrow?

210
00:24:33,752 --> 00:24:35,708
You always say this.

211
00:24:35,952 --> 00:24:37,510
Tomorrow is a little too soon.

212
00:24:38,512 --> 00:24:41,424
Mom said she'll sleep with me in my bed.

213
00:24:41,592 --> 00:24:45,631
Weren't you saying you're big enough to sleep alone?

214
00:24:45,912 --> 00:24:48,028
Mom is special!

215
00:25:09,512 --> 00:25:12,982
Dad, time to get up!

216
00:25:16,832 --> 00:25:19,266
Wake up!

217
00:25:24,592 --> 00:25:26,310
Sorry, I overslept again...

218
00:25:26,512 --> 00:25:28,343
I've got to bring a box lunch today.

219
00:25:28,592 --> 00:25:30,503
I totally forgot about it.

220
00:25:31,272 --> 00:25:33,547
It's all right. I've made something for all of us.

221
00:25:33,792 --> 00:25:34,508
It's burning!

222
00:25:34,752 --> 00:25:35,707
I'm coming.

223
00:25:38,712 --> 00:25:40,668
Here, this is yours, Mei.

224
00:25:41,512 --> 00:25:42,661
It's for me?

225
00:25:43,672 --> 00:25:45,105
Mei, sit down and eat!

226
00:25:47,672 --> 00:25:49,424
Here, wrap yours.

227
00:25:52,752 --> 00:25:55,346
Satsuki!

228
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:56,667
Uh-oh.

229
00:25:56,872 --> 00:25:59,625
I'm coming!

230
00:26:01,272 --> 00:26:02,785
You made a friend already?

231
00:26:03,032 --> 00:26:05,023
She's calling you!

232
00:26:05,512 --> 00:26:07,104
Yup, that's Michiko.

233
00:26:09,552 --> 00:26:10,951
Gotta go!

234
00:26:12,592 --> 00:26:14,025
See ya!

235
00:26:14,472 --> 00:26:16,428
See you later!

236
00:26:17,672 --> 00:26:18,627
Morning!

237
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:21,022
Hi, let's go.

238
00:26:33,552 --> 00:26:34,951
Daddy!

239
00:26:36,112 --> 00:26:37,625
Do I look all grown up?

240
00:26:37,832 --> 00:26:40,027
Yes dear. And where might you be going?

241
00:26:40,272 --> 00:26:41,944
I'm just going out.

242
00:27:04,432 --> 00:27:06,548
Daddy, is it lunch yet?

243
00:27:06,752 --> 00:27:08,708
Already?

244
00:27:20,872 --> 00:27:23,591
You be the flower shop, Daddy.

245
00:27:39,712 --> 00:27:41,111
Pole-tads!

246
00:27:59,632 --> 00:28:02,271
Got no bottom.

247
00:28:15,712 --> 00:28:16,701
Gotcha!

248
00:33:53,552 --> 00:33:56,510
Who are you? A big soot gremlin?

249
00:34:24,632 --> 00:34:27,704
To-to-ro? You're Totoro!

250
00:34:32,992 --> 00:34:35,062
I bet you're Totoro.

251
00:35:47,232 --> 00:35:47,709
See you!

252
00:35:47,952 --> 00:35:49,101
Okay, catch you later!

253
00:35:51,432 --> 00:35:52,228
I'm home!

254
00:35:52,392 --> 00:35:55,111
Hey there. Is it that late already?

255
00:35:55,272 --> 00:35:57,183
Where's Mei? I'm off to Michiko's.

256
00:35:57,352 --> 00:36:00,742
We haven't eaten yet. Is Mei in the garden?

257
00:36:03,112 --> 00:36:04,545
Mei!

258
00:36:17,952 --> 00:36:21,786
Dad, I found her hat!

259
00:36:45,992 --> 00:36:48,301
Wake up, Mei!

260
00:36:50,032 --> 00:36:52,227
You shouldn't sleep here!

261
00:36:54,192 --> 00:36:55,181
Where's Totoro?

262
00:36:55,392 --> 00:36:56,461
Totoro?

263
00:36:56,712 --> 00:36:59,306
Where?

264
00:37:01,632 --> 00:37:03,350
Were you dreaming?

265
00:37:03,512 --> 00:37:04,991
Totoro was here.

266
00:37:05,272 --> 00:37:08,264
You mean that troll in your picture book?

267
00:37:08,512 --> 00:37:15,463
Yeah. He was all hairy with a big mouth like this.

268
00:37:15,672 --> 00:37:22,271
There's a tiny one and a little one and a huge one like this.

269
00:37:26,352 --> 00:37:29,583
There you are. Wow, this is amazing.

270
00:37:30,432 --> 00:37:31,785
A great hiding place!

271
00:37:32,072 --> 00:37:35,303
Dad, Mei said she met a Totoro here.

272
00:37:35,512 --> 00:37:36,501
A Totoro?

273
00:37:37,352 --> 00:37:38,182
It's this way.

274
00:37:46,712 --> 00:37:48,350
Hey, wait for me!

275
00:37:50,392 --> 00:37:51,711
Huh?!

276
00:37:54,072 --> 00:37:55,027
Here?

277
00:37:55,232 --> 00:37:56,267
No.

278
00:37:56,872 --> 00:37:59,227
It went to a big tree.

279
00:37:59,392 --> 00:38:01,428
But there wasn't any other path.

280
00:38:02,072 --> 00:38:04,506
Mei! Come back!

281
00:38:19,432 --> 00:38:23,391
But it's true! Totoro was here.

282
00:38:23,872 --> 00:38:25,100
I'm not lying.

283
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:35,461
I know, Mei.

284
00:38:36,232 --> 00:38:37,665
I didn't lie.

285
00:38:37,872 --> 00:38:43,105
Neither of us think you're lying.

286
00:38:43,552 --> 00:38:49,104
You probably met the king of this forest. You were very lucky.

287
00:38:49,832 --> 00:38:52,710
He doesn't come out very often.

288
00:38:54,352 --> 00:38:56,422
We should pay our respects at the shrine.

289
00:38:56,632 --> 00:38:57,462
Pay our respects?

290
00:38:57,672 --> 00:38:59,390
To this forest.

291
00:39:15,912 --> 00:39:18,790
Mei, you're getting heavy.

292
00:39:19,032 --> 00:39:20,590
Daddy, look! That camphor tree!

293
00:39:21,912 --> 00:39:23,027
What a big tree.

294
00:39:31,432 --> 00:39:32,148
It's here!

295
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:34,701
Is that the tree?

296
00:39:35,712 --> 00:39:38,180
Dad, hurry up.

297
00:39:49,032 --> 00:39:50,988
The hole has gone.

298
00:39:51,192 --> 00:39:52,386
Are you sure it was here?

299
00:39:54,272 --> 00:39:56,103
The hole disappeared.

300
00:39:56,272 --> 00:39:58,547
I told you he doesn't come to see us often.

301
00:39:58,952 --> 00:40:01,466
But will he come again? I want to meet him, too.

302
00:40:02,472 --> 00:40:05,145
If you're lucky, sure.

303
00:40:06,472 --> 00:40:08,064
What a beautiful tree.

304
00:40:09,712 --> 00:40:14,103
This tree must have stood here for years and years.

305
00:40:15,592 --> 00:40:19,471
Trees and people used to be good friends.

306
00:40:20,632 --> 00:40:27,390
I saw that tree and fell in love with the house. Hope Mom likes it, too.

307
00:40:27,552 --> 00:40:30,703
Okay, let's pay our respects then get home for lunch.

308
00:40:30,912 --> 00:40:33,380
Yes, I promised to go see Michiko.

309
00:40:33,552 --> 00:40:34,951
I want to go, too!

310
00:40:35,432 --> 00:40:36,467
Attention!

311
00:40:36,952 --> 00:40:41,309
Thank you for looking after Mei.

312
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:43,622
Please take care of us.

313
00:40:44,472 --> 00:40:45,427
Let's race home!

314
00:40:48,472 --> 00:40:50,269
Wait!

315
00:40:51,552 --> 00:40:53,429
Hurry up!

316
00:40:53,632 --> 00:40:55,668
Wait for me!

317
00:40:57,912 --> 00:41:00,665
Dear Mother, something amazing happened today.

318
00:41:01,272 --> 00:41:04,503
Mei met a giant Totoro.

319
00:41:09,512 --> 00:41:14,028
And I'm hoping to see him myself soon, too.

320
00:41:44,312 --> 00:41:47,429
Kanta, hurry up! You'll be late!

321
00:42:31,232 --> 00:42:32,347
Mei?

322
00:42:32,952 --> 00:42:33,987
Excuse me!

323
00:42:34,232 --> 00:42:35,665
Yes, Satsuki?

324
00:42:36,272 --> 00:42:37,910
It's my sister...

325
00:42:45,072 --> 00:42:46,710
What happened, Nanny?

326
00:42:46,992 --> 00:42:51,543
I'm sorry. She insisted that she be with you.

327
00:42:52,072 --> 00:42:56,463
It's Dad's day at the university.

328
00:42:56,712 --> 00:42:59,670
You promised to be a good girl at Nanny's.

329
00:43:02,672 --> 00:43:06,745
I still have two more classes and Nanny's too busy for this...

330
00:43:07,232 --> 00:43:12,181
She was good up 'til now, weren't you?

331
00:43:19,712 --> 00:43:21,623
I'll go talk to my teacher.

332
00:43:27,792 --> 00:43:35,028
Since Satsuki's mother is in the hospital, I want you all to be nice to her.

333
00:43:42,152 --> 00:43:43,551
What's that?

334
00:43:43,712 --> 00:43:44,986
It's Totoro.

335
00:43:45,672 --> 00:43:48,550
Mei, you should keep quiet.

336
00:43:48,712 --> 00:43:49,667
Okay.

337
00:44:00,032 --> 00:44:02,626
Bye bye, Mei!

338
00:44:03,032 --> 00:44:04,590
I can't stay after class today.

339
00:44:04,752 --> 00:44:06,583
We'll let teacher know.

340
00:44:06,792 --> 00:44:08,191
See you!

341
00:44:09,912 --> 00:44:11,550
Hurry up, it's going to rain!

342
00:44:11,712 --> 00:44:12,622
Okay.

343
00:44:20,832 --> 00:44:22,185
Here it comes!

344
00:44:34,552 --> 00:44:35,302
Here.

345
00:44:39,352 --> 00:44:41,707
I won't cry. Aren't I good?

346
00:44:44,232 --> 00:44:46,666
It's getting worse...

347
00:44:48,912 --> 00:44:52,382
Dear Guardian Spirit, let us stay until the rain stops.

348
00:45:35,992 --> 00:45:37,220
But...

349
00:45:57,672 --> 00:45:59,742
That was lucky.

350
00:46:00,912 --> 00:46:02,823
It's got holes in it.

351
00:46:14,712 --> 00:46:16,907
Daddy forgot his umbrella.

352
00:46:17,192 --> 00:46:18,830
I'm going, too.

353
00:46:22,152 --> 00:46:23,870
I said I forgot it!

354
00:46:24,072 --> 00:46:27,462
What idiot forgets his umbrella on a rainy day?

355
00:46:27,992 --> 00:46:29,345
Ouch!

356
00:46:29,752 --> 00:46:31,743
You broke it playing, I bet.

357
00:46:31,912 --> 00:46:33,140
I did not!

358
00:46:46,592 --> 00:46:47,866
Excuse me.

359
00:46:50,112 --> 00:46:53,900
Hello Satsuki. Hi, Mei. Grandma!

360
00:46:55,312 --> 00:46:56,711
I'm sorry about Mei today.

361
00:46:56,912 --> 00:46:58,903
Not at all. Sorry we couldn't do more.

362
00:46:59,272 --> 00:47:02,309
Kanta lent us this umbrella.

363
00:47:02,512 --> 00:47:06,061
He did? A broken old thing like that!

364
00:47:06,632 --> 00:47:08,782
Mei was with me, so I was glad.

365
00:47:09,032 --> 00:47:12,547
But I'm so sorry that Kanta got wet.

366
00:47:12,952 --> 00:47:17,548
Not at all. It probably cleaned him up a little.

367
00:47:18,032 --> 00:47:19,306
Are you off to meet your father?

368
00:47:19,552 --> 00:47:20,109
Yes.

369
00:47:20,352 --> 00:47:21,865
What good girls you are.

370
00:47:22,312 --> 00:47:24,303
Bye bye, Mei.

371
00:47:35,232 --> 00:47:36,824
Who was that?

372
00:47:42,712 --> 00:47:44,623
Just in time!

373
00:47:57,752 --> 00:47:58,901
Getting on?

374
00:48:00,232 --> 00:48:01,950
All right, drive on.

375
00:48:10,352 --> 00:48:12,547
Daddy wasn't on it.

376
00:48:12,792 --> 00:48:16,865
He'll be on the next one. Why don't you wait at Nanny's?

377
00:48:53,152 --> 00:48:54,267
Are you okay?

378
00:49:27,992 --> 00:49:29,027
Sleepy?

379
00:49:29,952 --> 00:49:34,025
I told you. Wanna go to Nanny's?

380
00:49:35,992 --> 00:49:37,948
It won't be much longer. Hang in there.

381
00:49:44,272 --> 00:49:46,945
It's late...

382
00:49:54,552 --> 00:49:55,462
Come on.

383
00:51:19,192 --> 00:51:20,102
Are you Totoro?

384
00:51:30,432 --> 00:51:32,229
Wait a minute.

385
00:51:37,992 --> 00:51:39,186
You can use this.

386
00:51:40,552 --> 00:51:42,668
Take it, Mei's slipping off.

387
00:51:49,232 --> 00:51:50,631
Hold it like this.

388
00:53:07,672 --> 00:53:08,821
Here's the bus!

389
00:54:16,392 --> 00:54:20,067
He took Daddy's umbrella...

390
00:54:33,392 --> 00:54:34,541
I'm sorry.

391
00:54:34,752 --> 00:54:35,787
All right, drive on.

392
00:54:36,592 --> 00:54:39,664
The train was late and I missed the bus.

393
00:54:40,432 --> 00:54:42,150
Were you worried?

394
00:54:42,752 --> 00:54:44,868
We met him, Dad! He was here!

395
00:54:45,072 --> 00:54:46,710
And the Cat Bus!

396
00:54:47,232 --> 00:54:48,301
What?

397
00:54:48,552 --> 00:54:50,224
It was huge!

398
00:54:50,392 --> 00:54:54,305
With big eyes like these!

399
00:54:55,272 --> 00:54:59,424
We met him! We met Totoro!

400
00:54:59,992 --> 00:55:01,584
How wonderful!

401
00:55:13,312 --> 00:55:14,461
Come on, Daddy.

402
00:55:22,552 --> 00:55:26,340
Dear Mother, I can't tell you how excited I was today.

403
00:55:26,512 --> 00:55:31,188
It was the scariest, funniest day I've ever had.

404
00:55:31,392 --> 00:55:33,667
Totoro gave us a lovely present...

405
00:55:33,992 --> 00:55:38,304
...wrapped in bamboo leaves and tied with dragon whiskers.

406
00:55:38,512 --> 00:55:43,381
When we opened it, it was full of magic nuts and seeds!

407
00:55:48,312 --> 00:55:54,262
We decided to plant them in the garden to make a lovely forest.

408
00:55:54,512 --> 00:56:01,111
But they haven't sprouted yet. Mei sits there all day, waiting for them.

409
00:56:02,272 --> 00:56:05,787
She looks like a little crab.

410
00:56:10,872 --> 00:56:12,464
It's nearly summer vacation.

411
00:56:12,752 --> 00:56:17,109
Dearest, dear Mom, get well soon. Love, Satsuki.

412
00:56:20,512 --> 00:56:22,548
Come on. Bed time.

413
00:56:26,592 --> 00:56:27,263
Lights off!

414
00:56:27,432 --> 00:56:28,911
Wait, Dad.

415
00:56:29,512 --> 00:56:32,185
Daddy, do you think they will sprout tomorrow?

416
00:56:32,392 --> 00:56:37,466
Well, I'm sure Totoro would know. Night night.

417
00:57:26,592 --> 00:57:27,707
Mei!

418
00:57:45,752 --> 00:57:47,504
That's where we planted the seeds.

419
00:59:19,992 --> 00:59:22,267
Wow, we did it!

420
01:00:37,752 --> 01:00:40,550
We're the wind!

421
01:01:41,432 --> 01:01:42,990
There are no trees!

422
01:01:47,912 --> 01:01:49,743
Yessss!

423
01:01:52,872 --> 01:01:53,782
It was a dream.

424
01:01:53,992 --> 01:01:56,222
But it wasn't a dream.

425
01:01:57,832 --> 01:02:00,824
We did it!

426
01:02:17,592 --> 01:02:22,905
Mr. Kusakabe! Telegram!

427
01:02:27,512 --> 01:02:29,104
Anyone home?

428
01:02:35,872 --> 01:02:38,227
Nanny

429
01:02:42,432 --> 01:02:43,751
I'm here.

430
01:02:45,872 --> 01:02:47,703
This one is ripe.

431
01:02:57,032 --> 01:02:58,511
What about this one?

432
01:02:58,712 --> 01:03:00,065
That's good, too.

433
01:03:06,312 --> 01:03:09,509
Your garden's a treasure house.

434
01:03:10,152 --> 01:03:12,586
Let's take a little break.

435
01:03:18,752 --> 01:03:21,346
These should be cold now.

436
01:03:21,912 --> 01:03:23,391
Looks delicious.

437
01:03:32,752 --> 01:03:34,071
So good.

438
01:03:34,232 --> 01:03:40,068
The sun blessed these so they're really good for you.

439
01:03:40,592 --> 01:03:42,389
Would they help my Mom, too?

440
01:03:42,552 --> 01:03:47,467
Of course. If she eats my vegetables, she'll get better right away.

441
01:03:47,992 --> 01:03:50,506
She's supposed to be back next Saturday.

442
01:03:50,752 --> 01:03:52,708
She'll sleep in my bed!

443
01:03:53,432 --> 01:03:56,026
At last. That's wonderful.

444
01:03:56,232 --> 01:04:02,671
But it's only for a couple of days. To get used to the new house.

445
01:04:03,232 --> 01:04:07,225
I see. We'll feed her lots of vegetables, then.

446
01:04:07,432 --> 01:04:10,868
I'll give her this corn I picked.

447
01:04:11,032 --> 01:04:12,784
I'm sure she'll be very pleased.

448
01:04:13,392 --> 01:04:14,871
Yes!

449
01:04:22,512 --> 01:04:24,548
There was a telegram for you.

450
01:04:24,792 --> 01:04:25,622
For us?

451
01:04:30,032 --> 01:04:32,102
Dad won't be back till late, what shall I do?

452
01:04:32,752 --> 01:04:35,061
Open it, it might be important.

453
01:04:39,112 --> 01:04:42,946
PLEASE CONTACT, HOSPITAL...

454
01:04:43,232 --> 01:04:48,386
It's from Mom's hospital! Something's happened to her!

455
01:04:50,672 --> 01:04:52,663
Nanny! What shall I do?

456
01:04:52,872 --> 01:04:56,831
Calm down. Do you know where your Dad is?

457
01:04:57,032 --> 01:05:00,183
I know his office number, but we don't have a telephone.

458
01:05:00,392 --> 01:05:04,544
Kanta, take her to use the phone in the main house!

459
01:05:09,832 --> 01:05:12,824
Mei, stay here with me!

460
01:05:21,952 --> 01:05:23,783
Stay with Nanny, Mei!

461
01:06:01,192 --> 01:06:03,945
Hello, I'd like to make a long-distance call, please.

462
01:06:04,992 --> 01:06:09,429
It's Tokyo 31-1382.

463
01:06:10,952 --> 01:06:14,069
A cute girl, Kanta.

464
01:06:16,592 --> 01:06:18,947
Hello? Yes?

465
01:06:20,152 --> 01:06:25,101
Hello, may I speak to Dad... er... Mr. Kusakabe?

466
01:06:26,032 --> 01:06:27,784
It's his daughter, Satsuki.

467
01:06:31,992 --> 01:06:33,869
Daddy? It‘s me, Satsuki!

468
01:06:34,072 --> 01:06:39,829
Hello, what's up? From the hospital?

469
01:06:40,072 --> 01:06:42,711
Okay, I'll call them right away.

470
01:06:42,872 --> 01:06:45,705
Is there anything wrong with Mom?

471
01:06:45,912 --> 01:06:52,147
Don't worry. I'll check and call you right back.

472
01:06:53,872 --> 01:06:55,385
I'm hanging up now, stay there.

473
01:06:57,872 --> 01:07:01,342
May I stay here until he calls back?

474
01:07:01,952 --> 01:07:04,068
Stay as long as you like.

475
01:07:11,552 --> 01:07:13,622
Satsuki!

476
01:07:22,272 --> 01:07:25,230
No, this corn is for my Mommy!

477
01:07:27,032 --> 01:07:30,263
No, it's my Mom's!

478
01:07:46,392 --> 01:07:52,547
Listen Mei. Mom's not well so she's not coming home this time.

479
01:07:53,072 --> 01:07:54,266
No!

480
01:07:55,432 --> 01:07:59,107
There's nothing we can do. You don't want her to get worse, do you?

481
01:07:59,392 --> 01:08:00,871
No!

482
01:08:02,112 --> 01:08:04,148
It's just for a few more days.

483
01:08:07,472 --> 01:08:09,463
So you don't care if she dies, do you?

484
01:08:12,072 --> 01:08:14,461
Stop being silly! I'm going.

485
01:08:25,552 --> 01:08:26,507
Let's go, Mei.

486
01:08:30,152 --> 01:08:33,701
I hate you, Satsuki!

487
01:09:00,512 --> 01:09:04,300
We should bring the washing in...

488
01:09:04,832 --> 01:09:11,590
Don't worry too much, Satsuki. Nanny's here to help, so cheer up.

489
01:09:15,512 --> 01:09:19,585
Your Dad said he'll stop by the hospital to check on her.

490
01:09:20,312 --> 01:09:27,150
Besides, it's just a cold; she'll be back next week.

491
01:09:31,512 --> 01:09:35,187
They said it was just a cold...

492
01:09:36,192 --> 01:09:37,910
when she went into hospital.

493
01:09:39,512 --> 01:09:41,309
But what if she dies!

494
01:09:41,592 --> 01:09:43,310
Don't be silly, Satsuki.

495
01:09:44,152 --> 01:09:46,347
Maybe Mom will...

496
01:09:49,792 --> 01:09:56,709
Stop it. Nobody would leave two pretty little girls like you.

497
01:09:57,712 --> 01:10:01,307
There, there. Don't cry.

498
01:10:01,512 --> 01:10:06,347
I'll be here until Daddy comes back, okay?

499
01:10:48,232 --> 01:10:51,383
Mei!

500
01:10:55,752 --> 01:10:57,549
Mei!

501
01:11:00,472 --> 01:11:02,702
Mei!

502
01:11:05,592 --> 01:11:06,661
Did she come back?

503
01:11:06,872 --> 01:11:09,466
Wasn't she at the bus stop?

504
01:11:10,672 --> 01:11:13,709
That's strange. Where has she gone?

505
01:11:14,392 --> 01:11:17,623
I was nasty to her, 'cause she was being silly...

506
01:11:18,152 --> 01:11:20,712
Maybe she's heading for the hospital!

507
01:11:20,952 --> 01:11:26,788
The hospital? It would take a grown-up three hours!

508
01:11:27,032 --> 01:11:27,748
I'll go look!

509
01:11:29,312 --> 01:11:36,309
Kanta, hurry! Tell your dad that Mei is missing!

510
01:11:45,432 --> 01:11:48,185
Stupid Mei. Always getting lost.

511
01:11:56,032 --> 01:11:58,227
Mei!

512
01:12:05,272 --> 01:12:07,308
Excuse me.

513
01:12:09,272 --> 01:12:13,470
Have you seen a little girl pass by? She's my sister.

514
01:12:13,792 --> 01:12:19,150
No, I don't think so. I'm sure I would've noticed...

515
01:12:20,192 --> 01:12:21,864
Maybe she wasn't here.

516
01:12:41,392 --> 01:12:43,303
Are you sure she came this way?

517
01:12:43,472 --> 01:12:45,190
I don't know.

518
01:12:53,312 --> 01:12:55,428
Mei!

519
01:13:16,872 --> 01:13:18,624
Please, stop!

520
01:13:21,392 --> 01:13:22,381
Jerk! What are you doing?!

521
01:13:22,592 --> 01:13:25,425
I'm looking for my sister. Have you seen a little girl?

522
01:13:26,472 --> 01:13:27,507
Your little sister?

523
01:13:27,872 --> 01:13:31,467
She's four. I think she's heading to the hospital.

524
01:13:32,032 --> 01:13:33,260
Did you see anyone?

525
01:13:33,432 --> 01:13:38,904
No. We just came from there... but we didn't see anyone.

526
01:13:40,072 --> 01:13:41,744
Thanks anyway.

527
01:13:42,912 --> 01:13:44,470
Where have you come from?

528
01:13:44,712 --> 01:13:46,111
From Matsugo.

529
01:13:47,752 --> 01:13:49,424
Really?

530
01:13:50,792 --> 01:13:52,191
Good luck.

531
01:14:03,472 --> 01:14:04,985
Satsuki!

532
01:14:06,472 --> 01:14:08,667
Kanta!

533
01:14:09,512 --> 01:14:10,388
Find her?

534
01:14:10,552 --> 01:14:12,270
No. And you?

535
01:14:13,112 --> 01:14:17,424
Dad and the others are looking for her. I'll go to the hospital,

536
01:14:17,672 --> 01:14:19,230
you go back home.

537
01:14:19,472 --> 01:14:23,306
I guess she got lost on the way to the hospital.

538
01:14:23,672 --> 01:14:26,470
They found a sandal by the pond.

539
01:14:33,752 --> 01:14:36,585
We're not sure if it's hers or not!

540
01:14:53,752 --> 01:14:55,504
Did you find her?

541
01:15:26,792 --> 01:15:31,149
Dear Lord, please protect her and...

542
01:15:31,592 --> 01:15:33,822
It's too deep here, better search further away!

543
01:15:34,072 --> 01:15:36,142
Hey, are there any poles left?

544
01:15:44,952 --> 01:15:46,988
Grandma, Satsuki's here!

545
01:15:51,752 --> 01:15:53,504
Nanny!

546
01:15:54,592 --> 01:15:56,583
Look, is it hers?

547
01:16:05,752 --> 01:16:06,582
No, it isn't.

548
01:16:17,552 --> 01:16:23,070
Thank heavens, I was sure it was hers.

549
01:16:23,272 --> 01:16:25,991
Hey, Nanny was jumping to conclusions.

550
01:16:26,192 --> 01:16:27,625
It's not hers!

551
01:16:27,832 --> 01:16:29,663
Where's she gone then?

552
01:16:29,832 --> 01:16:31,265
Let's start from scratch.

553
01:16:31,512 --> 01:16:32,945
We better hurry, it'll be dark soon.

554
01:16:33,152 --> 01:16:36,781
I really appreciate your help, everyone.

555
01:16:36,992 --> 01:16:39,062
Don't worry. Could have been any of us.

556
01:17:06,992 --> 01:17:10,029
Please, help me Totoro!

557
01:17:10,232 --> 01:17:16,023
Mei is lost. It'll be dark soon. I'm sure she's scared somewhere...

558
01:17:46,872 --> 01:17:47,987
Totoro!

559
01:17:49,992 --> 01:17:53,871
Mei is lost and we can't find her!

560
01:17:54,632 --> 01:17:59,911
She must be scared, please help me find her.

561
01:18:01,312 --> 01:18:03,826
I don't know what to do...

562
01:19:02,472 --> 01:19:03,985
They can't see the bus.

563
01:19:51,752 --> 01:19:54,141
FOREST—SWAMP

564
01:19:54,352 --> 01:19:56,661
CEMETERY—SHRINE

565
01:19:56,832 --> 01:19:58,743
MEI

566
01:20:15,752 --> 01:20:18,186
Mei!

567
01:20:27,832 --> 01:20:29,026
The trees are moving out of the way!

568
01:21:06,352 --> 01:21:08,661
Satsuki!

569
01:21:23,392 --> 01:21:24,347
Mei!

570
01:21:29,032 --> 01:21:30,021
You silly girl.

571
01:21:30,272 --> 01:21:32,183
I'm sorry.

572
01:21:34,672 --> 01:21:37,869
You wanted to take the corn to Mom?

573
01:21:45,832 --> 01:21:48,266
HOSPITAL

574
01:21:49,952 --> 01:21:51,943
Will you take us to the hospital?

575
01:21:54,392 --> 01:21:55,950
Thank you so much.

576
01:22:05,072 --> 01:22:09,623
I'm sorry. They didn't need to send a telegram just for a cold.

577
01:22:09,992 --> 01:22:14,349
The girls must be worried. I'm sorry to upset them.

578
01:22:14,752 --> 01:22:17,220
They'll be fine. As long as you're okay.

579
01:22:17,472 --> 01:22:22,466
We've all learned to cope. This'll just postpone the enjoyment.

580
01:22:24,112 --> 01:22:27,548
They've put up with it so well.

581
01:22:27,832 --> 01:22:30,790
I'm especially sorry for Satsuki, she's been so patient.

582
01:22:31,992 --> 01:22:33,141
You're right.

583
01:22:33,872 --> 01:22:37,865
I'm going to spoil them for a while when I come home.

584
01:22:38,072 --> 01:22:38,902
Oh no!

585
01:22:46,392 --> 01:22:48,110
She's laughing!

586
01:22:48,352 --> 01:22:49,944
Looks like she's fine.

587
01:22:58,352 --> 01:23:01,264
I can't wait to get back on my feet.

588
01:23:03,152 --> 01:23:04,028
Look.

589
01:23:10,432 --> 01:23:12,024
Where did that come from?

590
01:23:13,952 --> 01:23:14,862
What?

591
01:23:15,552 --> 01:23:18,942
I could swear I just saw Satsuki and Mei laughing up in that tree.

592
01:23:22,152 --> 01:23:24,029
Maybe they were too. Look.

593
01:23:24,992 --> 01:23:27,426
'For Mother'

594
01:23:30,272 --> 01:23:37,189
<i>Totoro, Totoro</i>

595
01:23:45,592 --> 01:23:49,221
<i>Who leaves the seeds</i>

596
01:23:49,392 --> 01:23:52,509

<i>Follow them and you will see</i>

598
01:23:56,112 --> 01:24:00,469
<i>A treasure there</i>

599
01:24:00,672 --> 01:24:04,142
<i>Then plant the seeds</i>

600
01:24:04,312 --> 01:24:07,509
<i>And help them grow</i>

601
01:24:07,672 --> 01:24:10,903
<i>It may seem like a dream</i>

602
01:24:11,072 --> 01:24:14,860
<i>Things are not what they seem</i>

603
01:24:15,032 --> 01:24:18,024

<i>Totoro</i>

607
01:24:26,272 --> 01:24:29,742
<i>Totoro, Totoro</i>

608
01:24:29,952 --> 01:24:33,262
<i>Living in the forest trees</i>

609
01:24:33,432 --> 01:24:36,265
<i>For such a very, very long time</i>

610
01:24:36,432 --> 01:24:40,903
<i>There you'll be with Totoro, Totoro</i>

611
01:24:41,072 --> 01:24:44,542
<i>Totoro, Totoro</i>

612
01:24:44,712 --> 01:24:48,227
<i>You only see him when you're very young</i>

613
01:24:48,392 --> 01:24:52,783
<i>A magical adventure for you</i>

614
01:24:52,952 --> 01:24:56,661
<i>It's magic for you</i>

615
01:24:58,352 --> 01:25:01,947
<i>Rain tumbles down</i>

616
01:25:02,152 --> 01:25:05,144
<i>The bus is late</i>

617
01:25:05,312 --> 01:25:08,429
<i>Suddenly, a furry white giant</i>

618
01:25:08,592 --> 01:25:13,063
<i>Is by your side</i>

619
01:25:13,232 --> 01:25:16,827
<i>Don't be afraid</i>

620
01:25:16,992 --> 01:25:19,984
<i>Just open wide</i>

621
01:25:20,152 --> 01:25:23,827
<i>Your umbrella for him</i>

622
01:25:23,992 --> 01:25:27,348
<i>Watch him play in the rain</i>

623
01:25:27,592 --> 01:25:30,823
<i>Now begins a new adventure</i>

624
01:25:30,992 --> 01:25:33,950

<i>And on a moonlit night</i>

629
01:25:46,112 --> 01:25:48,865
<i>He plays a magic flute in the sky</i>

630
01:25:49,072 --> 01:25:50,983
<i>There you'll be with Totoro</i>

631
01:25:53,752 --> 01:25:57,108
<i>Totoro, Totoro</i>

632
01:25:57,232 --> 01:26:00,861
<i>You only see him when you're very young</i>

633
01:26:01,032 --> 01:26:05,389
<i>A magical adventure for you</i>

<i>It's magic for you</i>
