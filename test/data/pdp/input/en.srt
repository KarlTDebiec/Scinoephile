435
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:32,769
The debts pile up.      
The walls close in.      

436
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:35,539
Right becomes wrong.      
Wrong becomes wrong.      

437
00:24:35,574 --> 00:24:37,241
-Wait, who you calling?    
-No one.           

438
00:24:37,276 --> 00:24:40,143
Yeah, that sounds great.    
This menu looks really nice.  

439
00:24:40,178 --> 00:24:41,545
[Detective Pikachu]      
Wait, I'm confused.      

440
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:43,213
Are you hearing        
other voices besides mine?   

441
00:24:43,248 --> 00:24:44,481
All I wanna know is why    
I can understand you.     

442
00:24:44,516 --> 00:24:46,116
Ho! Can't help you there, kid. 

443
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:49,720
Like I said, I have amnesia.  
Can't remember a darn thing.  

444
00:24:49,755 --> 00:24:51,321
Okay, so you're        
a talking Pikachu       

445
00:24:51,356 --> 00:24:53,090
with no memories,       
who's addicted to caffeine.  

446
00:24:53,125 --> 00:24:56,426
I could stop whenever I want. 
These are just choices.    

447
00:24:56,461 --> 00:24:57,895
Another round. Extra shot.   

448
00:24:57,930 --> 00:24:59,463
[whispers] Black as night.   
Thank you, sweetie.      

449
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:00,697
Ludicolo!           

450
00:25:00,732 --> 00:25:02,399
[Detective Pikachu] Look,   
I'm a great detective.    

451
00:25:02,434 --> 00:25:03,901
But I can't solve my own    
mystery if I have no memory.  

452
00:25:03,936 --> 00:25:05,402
Then how do you even know   
you're a detective?      

453
00:25:05,437 --> 00:25:08,005
Well, I can feel that     
in my jellies.        

454
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,373
What is that? What is that?  

455
00:25:09,408 --> 00:25:11,041
It's the jellies.       
It's that thing, you know?   

456
00:25:11,076 --> 00:25:13,911
You feel it when you     
really believe in something  

457
00:25:13,946 --> 00:25:16,113
despite everyone telling you  
you're wrong.         

458
00:25:16,148 --> 00:25:18,081
Which is why I need      
to find Harry.        

459
00:25:18,116 --> 00:25:19,449
He's the key to my past.    

460
00:25:19,484 --> 00:25:21,418
-[Ludicolo] Ludicolo.     
-Thanks, doll.        

461
00:25:21,453 --> 00:25:25,055
I got some bad news for you  
'cause, uh, Harry's dead.   

462
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:26,957
[sputters]           

463
00:25:26,992 --> 00:25:31,395
What? No. No, no, no.     
No, Harry ain't dead.     

464
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:34,197
No, Harry is dead.       
You're wrong. I'm sorry.    

465
00:25:34,232 --> 00:25:35,699
I saw in the police report   
that he's dead.        

466
00:25:35,734 --> 00:25:37,334
Just 'cause the cops say    
he's dead--           

467
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:38,535
It means that         
he's legally dead.       

468
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:40,838
Really? Did they find a body? 

469
00:25:42,107 --> 00:25:43,640
Oh, I didn't think so.     

470
00:25:43,675 --> 00:25:46,610
And, by the way, did that   
report also say that I'm dead? 

471
00:25:46,645 --> 00:25:48,078
'Cause if I'm still alive   
and kicking,         

472
00:25:48,113 --> 00:25:49,346
that means Harry's       
out there, too.        

473
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:50,581
Case closed.          

474
00:25:50,616 --> 00:25:52,583
But still open        
until I solve it.       

475
00:25:52,618 --> 00:25:54,551
Okay, I'll bite. Solve what?  

476
00:25:54,586 --> 00:25:55,986
Oh, I'm glad          
you're gonna bite.       

477
00:25:56,021 --> 00:25:58,155
All right. Here it is.     

478
00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:00,457
Harry faked his own death.   

479
00:26:00,492 --> 00:26:03,460
Or somebody else faked     
Harry's death.         

480
00:26:03,495 --> 00:26:07,297
Or Harry faked         
somebody else's death.     

481
00:26:07,332 --> 00:26:09,600
That last one         
doesn't work at all.      

482
00:26:09,635 --> 00:26:11,602
-No, it doesn't.        
-The first two are contenders. 

483
00:26:11,637 --> 00:26:13,203
No, I'm gonna go.       
We're done here.       

484
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:14,671
-No, we are not done here.   
-This is...          

485
00:26:14,706 --> 00:26:16,840
Wait. Wait. Wait a minute.   
Where're you going?      

486
00:26:16,875 --> 00:26:18,942
Hold up a sec.         
We're gonna need each other.  

487
00:26:18,977 --> 00:26:22,179
No, we don't. I don't need   
a Pokemon. Period. Got it?   

488
00:26:22,214 --> 00:26:23,747
Then what about        
a world-class detective?    

489
00:26:23,782 --> 00:26:26,783
Because if you wanna find   
your pops, I'm your best bet. 

490
00:26:26,818 --> 00:26:28,118
I think            
a world-class detective    

491
00:26:28,153 --> 00:26:29,486
oughta have figured out by now 

492
00:26:29,521 --> 00:26:31,755
that I'm not here       
to find my father.       

493
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:33,457
I'm here to say goodbye.    

494
00:26:33,492 --> 00:26:36,093
Hey, hey. There's no one    
to say goodbye to.       

495
00:26:36,128 --> 00:26:38,862
Look, you can talk to humans. 
I can talk to Pokemon.    

496
00:26:38,897 --> 00:26:40,530
We can talk to each other.   

497
00:26:40,565 --> 00:26:43,700
This doesn't happen, kid.   
It has to mean something.   

498
00:26:43,735 --> 00:26:46,103
There's magic that       
brought us together,      

499
00:26:46,138 --> 00:26:49,273
and that magic is called hope. 

500
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:53,877
Hope that           
Harry is still alive.     

501
00:26:58,050 --> 00:27:02,152
Oh, you feel it. You feel it  
in your jellies, don't you?  

502
00:27:02,187 --> 00:27:03,687
There's nothing in my jellies. 

503
00:27:03,722 --> 00:27:06,824
We're gonna do this.      
You and me.          

504
00:27:09,394 --> 00:27:11,828
I can't belie... [sighs]    

505
00:27:11,863 --> 00:27:14,064
I will meet you here      
tomorrow morning.       

506
00:27:14,099 --> 00:27:15,766
Great.             

507
00:27:15,801 --> 00:27:17,701
-Where're you going?      
-To my apartment.       

508
00:27:17,736 --> 00:27:19,002
What do you mean,       
"Your apartment"?       

509
00:27:19,037 --> 00:27:20,270
What?             

510
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:21,605
All right,          
you can sleep on the couch.  

511
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,273
No, I'm not gonna sleep    
on the couch.         

512
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:24,875
[Detective Pikachu] Well, then 
you can sleep on the stove.  

513
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:26,810
Be a dear, would you,     
and get the door for me.    

514
00:27:26,845 --> 00:27:27,878
What am I doing?        

515
00:27:27,913 --> 00:27:28,979
[Detective Pikachu]      
I just invited        

516
00:27:29,014 --> 00:27:30,447
someone to my apartment.    

517
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:33,250
I never do this.       
I'm not that kind of Pokemon. 

518
00:27:36,221 --> 00:27:37,454
[door shuts]          

519
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:38,855
Dust everywhere.        

520
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:40,457
No fingerprints.        

521
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:43,326
Ugh. Doesn't add up.      

522
00:27:43,361 --> 00:27:44,761
[Tim] What is going on in here?

523
00:27:44,796 --> 00:27:46,663
I'm searching the joint,    
looking for clues.       

524
00:27:46,698 --> 00:27:48,298
-Is this your room?      
-No.             

525
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:50,000
Does Harry have        
other children?        

526
00:27:50,035 --> 00:27:51,668
No.              

527
00:27:51,703 --> 00:27:53,503
He wanted me to live here   
when I was a kid,       

528
00:27:53,538 --> 00:27:55,706
so he made it look like    
my childhood room.      

529
00:27:55,741 --> 00:27:57,274
Should we talk about the fact 

530
00:27:57,309 --> 00:27:59,276
that your childhood bed    
is a Pikachu bed?       

531
00:27:59,311 --> 00:28:00,343
It's a coincidence.      

532
00:28:00,378 --> 00:28:01,945
I'm sorry. Can you speak up?  

533
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:03,380
I can't hear you.       

534
00:28:03,415 --> 00:28:04,614
I've never been so flattered  

535
00:28:04,649 --> 00:28:06,249
and creeped out        
at the same time.       

536
00:28:06,284 --> 00:28:08,018
Are you gonna make me     
into a lampshade?       

537
00:28:08,053 --> 00:28:09,119
Oh, I might.          

538
00:28:09,154 --> 00:28:10,587
Hang on, hang on, hang on.   

539
00:28:10,622 --> 00:28:12,622
All these Pokemon cards    
and the battle posters...   

540
00:28:12,657 --> 00:28:15,058
There's a connection,     
isn't there?         

541
00:28:15,093 --> 00:28:17,627
-You love Pokemon.       
-No.              

542
00:28:17,662 --> 00:28:19,062
Yeah. Yeah, you do.      

543
00:28:19,097 --> 00:28:20,464
[Tim] That was a long time ago,

544
00:28:20,499 --> 00:28:21,932
before my father       
moved to the city       

545
00:28:21,967 --> 00:28:24,134
and spent more time with   
Pokemon than his own son.   

546
00:28:24,169 --> 00:28:26,036
Mmm, yeah,          
blame it on your dad.     

547
00:28:26,071 --> 00:28:27,537
Okay, look, what about this?  

548
00:28:27,572 --> 00:28:29,372
There's pictures of her    
all over the apartment.    

549
00:28:29,407 --> 00:28:30,607
She's obviously connected   
to Harry.           

550
00:28:30,642 --> 00:28:32,409
She might know me.       

551
00:28:32,444 --> 00:28:33,977
She could be a lead.      

552
00:28:34,012 --> 00:28:35,713
[sighs] No, she's not.     

553
00:28:36,815 --> 00:28:38,348
That's my mom.         

554
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:40,317
She passed away when I was 11. 

555
00:28:40,352 --> 00:28:43,386
Oh. I'm sorry. I...      

556
00:28:43,421 --> 00:28:45,022
I didn't realize.       

557
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,527
Tomorrow morning       
I'm gonna take you to Yoshida 

558
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:52,596
so we can get some answers.  

559
00:28:54,533 --> 00:28:56,033
[door shuts]          

560
00:28:59,971 --> 00:29:01,972
[Pokemon squeaking]      

561
00:29:19,624 --> 00:29:21,491
[door closes]         

562
00:29:21,526 --> 00:29:23,260
Ahh, my clues!         

563
00:29:23,295 --> 00:29:24,561
What is all this?       

564
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:26,029
Hard work.           
That's what this is.      

565
00:29:26,064 --> 00:29:27,898
And, by the way,        
we can't go to the cops.    

566
00:29:27,933 --> 00:29:29,766
Not till we know       
who we can trust.       

567
00:29:29,801 --> 00:29:31,735
So put my clues back in order, 
would you?           

568
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,503
These aren't clues. This is  
the work of a serial killer.  

569
00:29:33,538 --> 00:29:34,604
They're almost clues.     

570
00:29:34,639 --> 00:29:35,906
[Tim] What does that even mean?

571
00:29:35,941 --> 00:29:37,574
Trying to jog my memory,    
retrace my steps.       

572
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:39,476
It helps me          
to see it all laid out.    

573
00:29:39,511 --> 00:29:41,077
That's how I found this.    

574
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:44,181
This is what a Frenchman   
would call<i> caliente fiesta.</i>  

575
00:29:44,216 --> 00:29:45,282
Not French.          

576
00:29:45,317 --> 00:29:46,483
Smell my finger.        

577
00:29:46,518 --> 00:29:48,418
I will never          
smell your finger.       

578
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:49,719
Coward.            

579
00:29:49,754 --> 00:29:51,221
The point is,         
I smelled this R stuff     

580
00:29:51,256 --> 00:29:53,356
on those Aipom when      
they attacked us yesterday.  

581
00:29:53,391 --> 00:29:54,691
-R?              
-Bingo!            

582
00:29:54,726 --> 00:29:56,493
<i> La Cucaracha.</i>         

583
00:29:57,262 --> 00:30:00,530
See, I'm thinking Harry    

584
00:30:00,565 --> 00:30:02,199
caught a break in the case,  

585
00:30:02,234 --> 00:30:03,800
forcing our shadowy kingpin  

586
00:30:03,835 --> 00:30:06,903
to send out hired goons    
to deliver the big hush-hush. 

587
00:30:06,938 --> 00:30:08,538
We need to retrace       
Harry's steps.         

588
00:30:08,573 --> 00:30:09,940
Either solve          
the case ourselves       

589
00:30:09,975 --> 00:30:11,575
or get far enough       
along that this        

590
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:13,844
A-number-one bad guy      
has to reveal himself.     

591
00:30:13,879 --> 00:30:15,846
-Or herself!         
-Can you stop doing that?   

592
00:30:15,881 --> 00:30:18,381
So, what is the way in, huh?  

593
00:30:18,416 --> 00:30:19,883
The answer is in this room.  

594
00:30:19,918 --> 00:30:21,918
This isn't a room.       
This is a fire hazard.     

595
00:30:21,953 --> 00:30:25,189
It's just junk        
and papers and...       

596
00:30:27,425 --> 00:30:29,059
Newspapers.          

597
00:30:29,094 --> 00:30:30,527
What you got, kid?       

598
00:30:30,562 --> 00:30:32,195
I literally just met someone. 

599
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:34,798
She was a... She was     
a junior reporter at CNM.   

600
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:37,400
She was doing a story     
on Harry.           

601
00:30:37,435 --> 00:30:39,336
I think she knows       
more than she let on.     

602
00:30:39,371 --> 00:30:41,171
[laughs]           
The smart ones always do.   

603
00:30:41,206 --> 00:30:43,273
We gotta go down to her work  
and press her.         

604
00:30:43,308 --> 00:30:44,507
-Okay.            
-That's a metaphor.      

605
00:30:44,542 --> 00:30:46,109
Yeah, I know         
what a metaphor is.      

606
00:30:46,144 --> 00:30:47,677
-[cups clang]         
-Uh, I was drinking that.   

607
00:30:47,712 --> 00:30:49,112
I was also drink...      
Just step anywhere.      

608
00:30:49,147 --> 00:30:50,480
It's only my life's work.   

609
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:53,016
No. No, we're not doing that. 

610
00:30:53,051 --> 00:30:54,251
Fine, I'll walk.        

611
00:30:54,286 --> 00:30:57,154
I'm trying to get in      
100,000 steps this hour.    

612
00:30:59,257 --> 00:31:02,025
<i> Hello, I'm Roger Clifford,</i>   
<i> president of CNM</i>        

613
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:03,793
and chairman          
of Clifford Enterprises.    

614
00:31:03,828 --> 00:31:05,462
And I'm Howard Clifford,    

615
00:31:05,497 --> 00:31:07,664
the visionary icon       
behind Ryme City.       

616
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:09,766
Together,           
in the spirit of harmony,   

617
00:31:09,801 --> 00:31:11,534
we're throwing         
the largest parade       

618
00:31:11,569 --> 00:31:13,403
that Ryme City has ever seen. 

619
00:31:13,438 --> 00:31:14,971
You won't wanna miss it.    

620
00:31:15,006 --> 00:31:17,007
[Howard] So, at the weekend,  
we invite the people...    

621
00:31:17,042 --> 00:31:18,842
[Roger] And the Pokemon    
to be there.         

622
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:20,510
[Howard] A celebration     
of the harmony         

623
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:23,713
between humans and Pokemon.  

624
00:31:23,748 --> 00:31:25,949
-[man] And, cut!        
-[buzzer buzzes]        

625
00:31:25,984 --> 00:31:27,450
Well, I think         
that went rather well.     

626
00:31:27,485 --> 00:31:28,685
Oh, shut up, Dad!       

627
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,053
He seems nice.         

628
00:31:30,088 --> 00:31:31,855
Roger, please.         
This is supposed to be     

629
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:33,723
our gift to the citizens.   

630
00:31:33,758 --> 00:31:35,859
"Visionary icon"? Really?   

631
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:38,061
Was "savior of         
the world" taken?       

632
00:31:38,096 --> 00:31:40,597
It was your people who wrote  
the promo, son.        

633
00:31:40,632 --> 00:31:42,432
Oh, is there         
an unabridged version     

634
00:31:42,467 --> 00:31:44,534
where you cure cancer?     

635
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:45,902
Oh, that's right, yeah.    

636
00:31:45,937 --> 00:31:47,637
Turn your back on me      
like you always did.      

637
00:31:47,672 --> 00:31:48,905
[Ditto] Ditto!         

638
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:50,640
By the way, no one      
likes your Pokemon!      

639
00:31:50,675 --> 00:31:51,708
There she is.         

640
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:53,310
[Detective Pikachu whistles]  

641
00:31:53,345 --> 00:31:55,011
[Detective Pikachu] I can see 
why you were so excited.   

642
00:31:55,046 --> 00:31:57,681
I was... [scoffs] Okay,    
I was not that excited.    

643
00:31:57,716 --> 00:31:59,082
[Lucy] Mr. Clifford!      
Mr. Clifford!         

644
00:31:59,117 --> 00:32:01,885
Mr. Clifford,         
I may have a story for you.  

645
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,254
I've heard rumors       
of Pokemon attacking people.  

646
00:32:04,289 --> 00:32:05,922
But there's been       
no mainstream coverage.    

647
00:32:05,957 --> 00:32:07,824
[Roger] I'm sorry,       
we're not a tabloid.      

648
00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:09,693
Which means          
that we don't report      

649
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:12,829
on rumors, gossip or hearsay.  

650
00:32:12,864 --> 00:32:15,732
It's not news         
if it can't be verified.    

651
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:19,602
You want a story,       
find a source.        

652
00:32:19,637 --> 00:32:21,772
Oh, and pro tip:        

653
00:32:22,741 --> 00:32:25,242
A reasonable sense of fashion. 

654
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:32,883
[sighs]            

655
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:37,854
[tutting] Here she comes.   

656
00:32:37,889 --> 00:32:39,222
Here she comes.        
Try to look deep.       

657
00:32:39,257 --> 00:32:40,790
What are you doing here?    

658
00:32:40,825 --> 00:32:42,359
Hey, again. Uh...       

659
00:32:42,394 --> 00:32:43,793
Yeah, I know this seems weird 

660
00:32:43,828 --> 00:32:45,795
but I actually needed     
to ask you something.     

661
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:47,797
Now's not really a good time. 

662
00:32:47,832 --> 00:32:51,568
Yeah, I saw that. I'm sorry.  

663
00:32:51,603 --> 00:32:53,737
[Detective Pikachu       
slurping loudly]        

664
00:32:56,007 --> 00:32:58,575
Sorry. It's piping hot.    

665
00:32:58,610 --> 00:33:01,211
You found yourself       
a Pokemon partner.       

666
00:33:01,246 --> 00:33:03,013
-[chuckles] Not exactly, no.  
-Aw.              

667
00:33:03,048 --> 00:33:04,414
He's cute.           

668
00:33:04,449 --> 00:33:06,349
She's trying to work me, kid. 
But, trust me, I can...    

669
00:33:06,384 --> 00:33:09,452
Oh, sweet Mother of Arceus,  
that feels so good.      

670
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:11,621
-So, listen...         
-Oh, my God.          

671
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:12,922
What happened?         

672
00:33:12,957 --> 00:33:14,758
I found something       
in Harry's desk,       

673
00:33:14,793 --> 00:33:16,760
nearly choked me to death,   
and I was--           

674
00:33:16,795 --> 00:33:17,995
[whispers] No, not here.    

675
00:33:19,798 --> 00:33:22,365
In my office.         

676
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:25,235
[whispers] In her office?   
We're going to her office?   

677
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:26,903
[objects clattering]      

678
00:33:27,472 --> 00:33:29,005
This is great.         

679
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:32,275
This isn't an office.     
It's a coffin with pencils.  

680
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:33,676
Psyduck?            

681
00:33:33,711 --> 00:33:34,911
Yeah, that's right.      
I can talk to the kid,     

682
00:33:34,946 --> 00:33:36,246
he can talk to me.       
We're gifted.         

683
00:33:36,281 --> 00:33:38,214
You didn't tell me      
that she has a Psyduck.    

684
00:33:38,249 --> 00:33:40,750
These things explode      
when they're stressed.     

685
00:33:40,785 --> 00:33:42,452
Hey. Hey, keep calm, pal.   

686
00:33:42,487 --> 00:33:44,921
Serenity now. Serenity now.  

687
00:33:45,557 --> 00:33:47,257
-No.              
-Okay.             

688
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:49,025
[Lucy] Okay.          

689
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:51,028
-You got it?          
-Here it is.          

690
00:33:54,833 --> 00:33:55,999
Where did you find these?   

691
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:57,333
Word on the street was that  

692
00:33:57,368 --> 00:33:59,102
Harry had an informant     
near the docks.        

693
00:33:59,137 --> 00:34:00,770
I went there to snoop around, 

694
00:34:00,805 --> 00:34:02,939
and that's where       
I found the vial.       

695
00:34:02,974 --> 00:34:05,608
But the docks         
can be dangerous.       

696
00:34:05,643 --> 00:34:06,810
It's not the sort of place   

697
00:34:06,845 --> 00:34:09,245
you want to visit alone    
at night.           

698
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,882
I'm actually pretty good    
at being alone at night.    

699
00:34:13,184 --> 00:34:16,319
Nope, that did not land right 
at all.            

700
00:34:16,354 --> 00:34:20,223
That's not... That's not    
what I meant to say. Um...   

701
00:34:20,258 --> 00:34:22,358
-It's okay.          
-I'm just gonna...       

702
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:23,927
[stammers] We should go.    

703
00:34:23,962 --> 00:34:26,196
-Yeah, we should go.      
-I'm just gonna scoot by ya.  

704
00:34:26,231 --> 00:34:28,798
Good God, have you ever talked 
to a woman before?       

705
00:34:28,833 --> 00:34:30,767
-[Lucy] You've got some...   
-[Psyduck] Psyduck.      

706
00:34:30,802 --> 00:34:33,002
Yes, I've talked women before. 
No, I don't need your help.  

707
00:34:33,037 --> 00:34:35,305
Was it during         
the birth canal, or...     

708
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:36,940
[Tim sighs]          

709
00:34:40,145 --> 00:34:41,444
[Detective Pikachu]      
You know what you need?    

710
00:34:41,479 --> 00:34:43,346
A shoulder saddle.       
I bet someone makes one.    

711
00:34:43,381 --> 00:34:44,948
[Tim] Okay. There are other  
ways for you to get around.  

712
00:34:44,983 --> 00:34:46,549
This is humiliating.      

713
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:48,051
[Detective Pikachu] Every step 
for you is 1000 for me,    

714
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:49,219
and my lungs         
are the size of grapes.    

715
00:34:49,254 --> 00:34:50,687
We need to get        
some ground rules       

716
00:34:50,722 --> 00:34:51,721
if this partnership's     
gonna work.          

717
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:53,289
[Tim] You're not my partner.  

718
00:34:53,324 --> 00:34:54,524
[Detective Pikachu]      
Mentor,<i> sensei,</i> master,    

719
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:55,525
whatever you wanna call it.  

720
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,093
[Tim] Nope, none of those.   

721
00:34:57,128 --> 00:34:58,661
Hey, what if it wasn't the  
gas? What if it's hereditary? 

722
00:34:58,696 --> 00:35:01,231
What if Harry could understand 
your annoying voice, too?   

723
00:35:01,266 --> 00:35:03,600
You don't need to talk to us  
for us to understand.     

724
00:35:03,635 --> 00:35:05,368
We can feel          
what you're saying.      

725
00:35:05,403 --> 00:35:08,404
You have to be open to the   
experience. Try it sometime.  

726
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:09,739
Yeah, I'd rather not.     

727
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:11,040
I got my plate full      
talking to you.        

728
00:35:11,075 --> 00:35:12,342
[object clattering]      

729
00:35:12,377 --> 00:35:13,576
What is that?         

730
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:14,978
Silent but deadly.       

731
00:35:15,013 --> 00:35:16,646
Apologies, my tummy's bad   
from all the coffee.     

732
00:35:16,681 --> 00:35:18,215
No. Ew. Get off.        

733
00:35:18,983 --> 00:35:20,750
I meant that.         

734
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:22,619
[Detective Pikachu]      
Oh. Ooh. Ugh.         

735
00:35:22,654 --> 00:35:23,887
That.             

736
00:35:23,922 --> 00:35:26,689
It's a Mr. Mime.        
They're the worst.       

737
00:35:26,724 --> 00:35:29,559
Silent but annoying.      

738
00:35:29,594 --> 00:35:32,295
Does he recognize you?     
I think he recognizes you.   

739
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:35,165
Well, I was Harry's partner,  
so I would've been with him.  

740
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,232
[gasps]            

741
00:35:36,267 --> 00:35:38,535
[both] Harry's informant    
is a Pokemon!         

742
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:39,769
[Detective Pikachu] Get him!  

743
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:47,911
-He's barely moving.     
-Don't tell him that.     

744
00:35:47,946 --> 00:35:49,212
-Oh! He's on a bike.      
-[engine starting sound]    

745
00:35:49,247 --> 00:35:50,647
Come on! He thinks       
he's getting away.       

746
00:35:50,682 --> 00:35:51,981
Look, quick!          
Get in front of him.      

747
00:35:52,016 --> 00:35:53,950
-Cut him off. You can make it. 
-Stop.             

748
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:56,686
-[tires squeal, crash]     
-[Detective Pikachu] Oh, no.  

749
00:35:56,721 --> 00:35:58,855
He's going down hard, Tim.   

750
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:00,890
Should've worn a helmet.    

751
00:36:00,925 --> 00:36:02,091
I hope he makes it.      

752
00:36:02,126 --> 00:36:04,527
Come on. This is ridiculous.  

753
00:36:04,562 --> 00:36:05,895
[Detective Pikachu]      
I'm good cop, you're bad cop. 

754
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:07,163
[Tim] We're not cops.     

755
00:36:07,198 --> 00:36:08,464
[Detective Pikachu]      
Grow some berries.      

756
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:09,766
You're bigger and tougher   
looking than I am.      

757
00:36:09,801 --> 00:36:11,334
Stand up straight!       

758
00:36:11,369 --> 00:36:12,468
Listen up.           

759
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:14,270
We got ways to make you talk. 
Or mime.           

760
00:36:14,305 --> 00:36:15,605
Yeah.             

761
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:16,806
[Detective Pikachu] So tell us 
what we wanna know.      

762
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:18,141
Why was Harry Goodman here   

763
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:20,010
and what did it have to do   
with the R?          

764
00:36:21,446 --> 00:36:23,446
Pipe. Yes, okay. A can!    

765
00:36:23,481 --> 00:36:24,981
Shoving. Pushing.       

766
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:26,182
My problem is that       
I push people away       

767
00:36:26,217 --> 00:36:27,750
and then hate them       
for leaving.          

768
00:36:27,785 --> 00:36:29,986
-He's saying you can shove it. 
-What? I can shove it?     

769
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:31,588
Okay, that's it.        
We're switching roles.     

770
00:36:31,623 --> 00:36:32,889
I'm bad cop, you're good cop. 

771
00:36:32,924 --> 00:36:34,324
-No, no, no, we're not cops!  
-Oh!              

772
00:36:34,359 --> 00:36:36,059
Oh, God,            
that's a very hard wall.    

773
00:36:36,094 --> 00:36:37,727
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah,     
Mr. Mime has the ability    

774
00:36:37,762 --> 00:36:39,696
to make invisible walls.    

775
00:36:39,731 --> 00:36:42,365
Uh, yes, I know. I happen to  
be a Pokemon, too, remember?  

776
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:46,202
Look, Harry figured this guy  
out somehow.          

777
00:36:46,237 --> 00:36:49,072
I think the trick is      
getting inside his head.    

778
00:36:50,341 --> 00:36:51,441
I have an idea.        

779
00:36:53,177 --> 00:36:54,644
What are you doing?      

780
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:55,845
[door unlocking sound]     

781
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,113
[Tim] Oh, what's this?     

782
00:36:57,148 --> 00:36:58,648
Oh, there's a door there.   
I didn't...          

783
00:36:58,683 --> 00:37:00,016
Probably because        
it's invisible.        

784
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:02,785
Huh? Yeah! I'm in your space  
now, am I right?        

785
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:04,887
You don't like this so much,  
do you?            

786
00:37:04,922 --> 00:37:07,023
What are you doing?      

787
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:09,225
That's a jug.         
No, you're pouring.      

788
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:10,360
No.              

789
00:37:10,395 --> 00:37:11,928
Salt. It's a salt shaker.   
You're cooking.        

790
00:37:11,963 --> 00:37:13,229
-No.              
-Real cooking is about     

791
00:37:13,264 --> 00:37:14,264
following your heart,     
not a recipe!         

792
00:37:14,299 --> 00:37:15,665
What are you talking about?  

793
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:18,067
Gas. You're pouring      
gasoline on... [gasps]     

794
00:37:18,102 --> 00:37:20,903
-Mmm-hmm.           
-Oh, that went dark fast.   

795
00:37:20,938 --> 00:37:23,106
I like this.          
I like this very much.

Okay. You wanna        
play that game?        

800
00:37:29,947 --> 00:37:31,648
I can play that game.

-[grunts]

You think that's funny?    

803
00:37:35,887 --> 00:37:37,487
You think that's funny, huh?  

804
00:37:37,522 --> 00:37:40,723
You're not gonna be      
laughing soon, huh?      

805
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:43,159
Who's laughing now, huh?    

806
00:37:43,194 --> 00:37:46,095
Oh. Oh, I smell what      
you're stepping in.      

807
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:47,430
That's right, Mr. Mime.    

808
00:37:47,465 --> 00:37:49,766
[laughs]           
You're about to be Mr. Melt  

809
00:37:49,801 --> 00:37:51,334
unless you start talking.   

810
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:54,904
Cards, cards. Playing cards.  
Poker.             

811
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:56,472
No, I think he's talking    
about the R.          

812
00:37:56,507 --> 00:37:58,241
[Detective Pikachu]      
Someone was handing out R.   

813
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:00,176
Use your body words. Where?  

814
00:38:00,211 --> 00:38:02,278
Circle house. Moon house.   
Moon. House.         

815
00:38:02,313 --> 00:38:04,380
Enough with the games.     
Say it.            

816
00:38:04,415 --> 00:38:05,515
Just say it!          

817
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:07,050
Talk, you stupid mime!     

818
00:38:07,085 --> 00:38:09,119
Okay, just relax.       

819
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:11,020
Uh, round.           

820
00:38:11,055 --> 00:38:12,422
Round house. Uh...       

821
00:38:12,457 --> 00:38:14,390
The source of the R      
came from the Roundhouse.   

822
00:38:14,425 --> 00:38:15,858
Yeah, nice work, kid.     
Maybe there's         

823
00:38:15,893 --> 00:38:17,794
a little detective       
in you after all.

[cheering]           

828
00:38:50,862 --> 00:38:53,629
I didn't know they had    
Pokemon battles in Ryme City. 

829
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:54,698
We're not supposed to.

[cheering]           

835
00:39:10,615 --> 00:39:12,449
Come on.           
Let's take a look around.   

836
00:39:17,989 --> 00:39:20,056
Okay, kid.          
So here's what we know.    

837
00:39:20,091 --> 00:39:22,125
Harry traces the R to here.  

838
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,359
Then frequents this joint   
because someone        

839
00:39:23,394 --> 00:39:24,894
here knows something      
about something.        

840
00:39:24,929 --> 00:39:27,897
We just need to find      
the someone and the something. 

841
00:39:27,932 --> 00:39:32,468
Hey, hey! Where's that     
Pikachu's partner? Don't go.  

842
00:39:32,503 --> 00:39:34,537
I think the "someone"     
just found us.        

843
00:39:34,572 --> 00:39:36,105
[Detective Pikachu]      
Wow. I'd like to see      

844
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:37,507
this guy's Internet      
search history.        

845
00:39:37,542 --> 00:39:38,741
Who are you?          

846
00:39:38,776 --> 00:39:39,876
Let's see where this goes.   

847
00:39:39,911 --> 00:39:41,110
Tell him            
you're my new partner.     

848
00:39:41,145 --> 00:39:43,112
[hesitantly]          
I'm his new partner.      

849
00:39:43,147 --> 00:39:45,114
Well, that Pikachu's      
Thunderbolt

-Oh.             

852
00:39:50,588 --> 00:39:51,921
Scar is still fresh.      

853
00:39:51,956 --> 00:39:55,792
All I hear are consonants,   
and all I see are nipples.   

854
00:39:55,827 --> 00:39:57,660
-And you know what?      
-[growls]           

855
00:39:57,695 --> 00:40:00,129
He ruined my coat, man.    
Look at this.         

856
00:40:00,164 --> 00:40:01,330
[Tim] I'm so sorry.      

857
00:40:01,365 --> 00:40:03,099
Forget the coat.        
Where's his shirt?       

858
00:40:03,134 --> 00:40:06,002
This! This is my place!    

859
00:40:06,037 --> 00:40:08,471
And nobody comes into my place 

860
00:40:08,506 --> 00:40:10,773
and does that to my Pokemon.  

861
00:40:10,808 --> 00:40:11,974
What are you looking at?    

862
00:40:12,009 --> 00:40:13,810
Or to my coat.         

863
00:40:13,845 --> 00:40:15,711
Right, the coat. The coat.   

864
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:17,180
What are you doing?      

865
00:40:17,215 --> 00:40:19,015
Classic staredown, kid.    
First one to blink loses.   

866

Er, look, I just wanna know  

868
00:40:22,353 --> 00:40:24,153
why his old partner was here. 
That's all.

Okay.             

878
00:40:43,241 --> 00:40:45,341
A new battle's unfolding.   

879
00:40:45,376 --> 00:40:48,644
Pikachu versus Charizard.   

880
00:40:48,679 --> 00:40:49,912

You never wanna        
go into these things tight.  

887
00:41:02,527 --> 00:41:04,627
You're gonna win        
this time, okay?        

888
00:41:04,662 --> 00:41:07,163
What are you doing?      
What is your plan of attack?  

889
00:41:07,198 --> 00:41:08,998
I don't operate        
according to plans, kid.    

890
00:41:09,033 --> 00:41:11,200
I deal with things

[snarling]

Now, obviously, I've dealt   
with this putz before,     

895
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:24,780
so I'll just do it again.

That thing just chugged    

899
00:41:28,619 --> 00:41:30,453
a year's worth         
of that R stuff!        

900
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:32,889
Hey, hey, hey.        
It's like you said, okay?   

901
00:41:32,924 --> 00:41:34,023
You did it before.       

902
00:41:34,058 --> 00:41:35,558
You just gotta         
use your powers.        

903
00:41:35,593 --> 00:41:38,327
You can use Quick Attack,   
Discharge, or Electro Ball,  

904
00:41:38,362 --> 00:41:39,795
but I think Volt Tackle    

905
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:41,297
is your best move,      
so start with that.      

906
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:42,765
First of all,         

907
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,367
when did you learn       
how to be a Pokemon Trainer?  

908
00:41:44,402 --> 00:41:46,435
And secondly, get me     
the hell out of here!

I forgot everything you said!

00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:54,844
I forget things, it's what   
I do! I have amnesia!     

914
00:41:54,879 --> 00:41:57,046
You need to go for a      
critical hit. Use Volt Tackle! 

915
00:41:57,081 --> 00:42:00,116
Volt Tackle will knock me out. 
I'm going for Thunderbolt.

00:46:10,401 --> 00:46:12,701
It's very difficult      
coping with loss.       

1014
00:46:12,736 --> 00:46:14,136
Denial can be         
a powerful thing.       

1015
00:46:14,171 --> 00:46:16,772
No, I'm not in denial!     
I'm right, I know it!     

1016
00:46:16,807 --> 00:46:19,041
He's... He's out there.    

1017
00:46:22,546 --> 00:46:23,913
[sighs]            

1018
00:46:24,949 --> 00:46:27,383
I never wanted        
to show you this,       

1019
00:46:27,418 --> 00:46:29,986
but I think          
it's important you see it.   

1020
00:46:31,055 --> 00:46:32,121
[beeps]            

1021
00:46:37,728 --> 00:46:41,096
No one could survive      
a crash like that.       

1022
00:46:41,131 --> 00:46:42,865
Not even your dad.       

1023
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:48,104
He's gone, Tim.        

1024
00:46:51,942 --> 00:46:53,476
[train passing]        

1025
00:46:59,116 --> 00:47:01,551
I should've          
gotten on that train.     

1026
00:47:04,388 --> 00:47:05,922
What's that, kid?       

1027
00:47:08,692 --> 00:47:10,726
After my mom died,       

1028
00:47:11,729 --> 00:47:13,863
my dad and I drifted apart.  

1029
00:47:13,898 --> 00:47:15,064
Er...             

1030
00:47:15,099 --> 00:47:18,968
He moved here and poured    
himself into his work.     

1031
00:47:20,938 --> 00:47:22,571
And, eventually,        
he tried to get me       

1032
00:47:22,606 --> 00:47:24,473
to come live with him,     

1033
00:47:25,276 --> 00:47:26,709
but I wouldn't go.       

1034
00:47:28,245 --> 00:47:29,679
How come?           

1035
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:34,216
[sighs]            

1036
00:47:34,251 --> 00:47:36,018
I didn't think he cared.    

1037
00:47:38,622 --> 00:47:44,627
I guess I just got used to him 
not being around        

1038
00:47:44,662 --> 00:47:47,797
and I couldn't forgive him   
for it.            

1039
00:47:49,366 --> 00:47:51,100
Until I got here.       

1040
00:47:54,838 --> 00:47:57,039
And I realized        
that he did care.       

1041
00:47:59,376 --> 00:48:02,378
But I didn't know...      

1042
00:48:02,413 --> 00:48:03,679
[breathing shakily]      

1043
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:06,616
because I never        
gave him the chance.      

1044
00:48:07,618 --> 00:48:10,820
And now it's too late.     

1045
00:48:14,858 --> 00:48:16,859
[sobbing] I really...     

1046
00:48:19,096 --> 00:48:21,931
I really wish         
I'd gotten on that train.   

1047
00:48:24,335 --> 00:48:25,768
[Detective Pikachu] Mmm-hmm.  

1048
00:48:29,039 --> 00:48:30,506
Listen, kid.          

1049
00:48:31,308 --> 00:48:32,708
Um...             

1050
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:35,577
Look, I may not have memories, 

1051
00:48:35,612 --> 00:48:38,114
um, but I know this much:   

1052
00:48:39,850 --> 00:48:41,550
It wasn't your fault.     

1053
00:48:44,321 --> 00:48:46,289
It wasn't anybody's fault.   

1054
00:48:48,792 --> 00:48:51,594
And I'm sure that       
if your dad was here,     

1055
00:48:53,330 --> 00:48:55,497
he would hug you so hard,   

1056
00:48:55,532 --> 00:48:57,266
your bones would pop.     

1057
00:48:58,268 --> 00:48:59,301
And he'd tell you       

1058
00:48:59,336 --> 00:49:01,137
he's sorry for everything.   

1059
00:49:03,741 --> 00:49:06,208
He'd be            
damn proud of you, kid.    

1060
00:49:10,214 --> 00:49:12,514
I haven't been        
really nice to you.      

1061
00:49:12,549 --> 00:49:14,650
No, you really haven't.    

1062
00:49:14,685 --> 00:49:16,619
[chuckles and sniffles]    

1063
00:49:18,555 --> 00:49:19,822
Well...            

1064
00:49:20,991 --> 00:49:23,025
We still got         
one mystery to solve.     

1065
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:24,326
What?             

1066
00:49:24,361 --> 00:49:25,661
Yours.             

1067
00:49:26,997 --> 00:49:29,798
Let's find out         
who did this to you.      

1068
00:49:29,833 --> 00:49:31,333
Get your memory back.     

1069
00:49:31,368 --> 00:49:32,868
I'd like that.         

1070
00:49:33,837 --> 00:49:35,571
I'd like that very much.    

1071
00:49:35,606 --> 00:49:36,973
[vehicle approaching]     

1072
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:41,243
Well, that's a bad-guy car.  

1073
00:50:00,097 --> 00:50:01,697
[Howard]           
Thank you, Miss Norman.    

1074
00:50:01,732 --> 00:50:04,700
Yes. Thank you, Miss Norman.  
That'll be all.        

1075
00:50:04,735 --> 00:50:06,235
What a blabbermouth.      

1076
00:50:06,937 --> 00:50:09,271
[Howard] Please, come in.   

1077
00:50:12,643 --> 00:50:13,876
[Pokemon chitters]       

1078
00:50:13,911 --> 00:50:16,211
Magnificent creatures,     
aren't they?          

1079
00:50:16,246 --> 00:50:17,613
[chittering]          

1080

Whoa. A Flareon.        

1081
00:50:27,558 --> 00:50:30,292
[Howard] Imagine        
being able to evolve      

1082
00:50:30,327 --> 00:50:33,128

version of yourself.      

1083
00:50:33,163 --> 00:50:35,364
-[chitters]          
-Hmm. 'Sup?          

1084
00:50:35,399 --> 00:50:40,069
That greatness inside you,   
just waiting to be awoken.   

1085
00:50:43,574 --> 00:50:44,673
Hello, Tim.          

1086
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:46,141
He knows you?         

1087
00:50:46,176 --> 00:50:48,877
I see you've partnered     
with Harry's Pikachu.     

1088
00:50:48,912 --> 00:50:50,412
And he knows me, too.     

1089
00:50:50,447 --> 00:50:52,114
You knew Harry?        

1090
00:50:52,149 --> 00:50:54,717
The case Harry was working on, 

1091
00:50:55,285 --> 00:50:56,351
it was for me.         

1092
00:50:56,386 --> 00:50:58,921
That's a twist.        
That's very twisty.      

1093
00:50:58,956 --> 00:51:03,058
This compound threatens    
everything I've built.    

1094
00:51:03,093 --> 00:51:05,327
He knows about the R.     
How does he know about the R? 

1095
00:51:05,362 --> 00:51:08,130
I hired Harry         
to trace it to its source.   

1096
00:51:08,165 --> 00:51:11,133
Imagine my shock        
when the answer        

1097
00:51:11,168 --> 00:51:13,769
turned out to be my own son.  

1098
00:51:15,405 --> 00:51:18,540
I've devoted my life     
to perfecting the partnership 

1099
00:51:18,575 --> 00:51:20,209
between Pokemon and humans.  

1100
00:51:20,244 --> 00:51:23,745
A partnership where Pokemon  
bring out the best in us.   

1101
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:26,014
In doing so,          
I'm afraid I neglected     

1102
00:51:26,049 --> 00:51:28,417
my responsibilities      
as a parent.         

1103
00:51:31,155 --> 00:51:33,455
Roger resents the Pokemon.   

1104
00:51:33,490 --> 00:51:36,825
I think he's lived in     
my shadow for so long,     

1105
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:39,928
he actually wants       
to destroy my legacy.     

1106
00:51:39,963 --> 00:51:41,130
Well, there's no such thing  

1107
00:51:41,165 --> 00:51:42,631
as "daddy issues"       
without "daddy".       

1108
00:51:42,666 --> 00:51:45,200
But, Mr. Clifford,       
how could you let him do that? 

1109
00:51:45,235 --> 00:51:48,103
Ever since my illness     
put me in this chair,     

1110
00:51:48,138 --> 00:51:51,306
Roger has taken over more   
and more of the company.   

1111
00:51:51,341 --> 00:51:52,608
He controls the board.     

1112
00:51:52,643 --> 00:51:55,511
He also controls the police  
and the politicians.     

1113
00:51:55,546 --> 00:51:57,412
And he owns the press.     

1114
00:51:57,447 --> 00:52:00,749
Harry is the only one     
I can trust.         

1115
00:52:00,784 --> 00:52:03,486
That's why          
you need to find him.     

1116
00:52:04,121 --> 00:52:05,821
You haven't heard.       

1117
00:52:05,856 --> 00:52:07,556
Harry's dead.         

1118
00:52:07,591 --> 00:52:09,091
Oh, no, Tim.          

1119
00:52:10,294 --> 00:52:12,060
Your father          

1120
00:52:12,095 --> 00:52:13,362
is alive.

Advanced holographic imaging. 

1124
00:52:24,875 --> 00:52:27,142
Since being confined      
to this chair,         

1125
00:52:27,177 --> 00:52:32,281
I've invested in ways     
of bringing the world to me.  

1126
00:52:32,316 --> 00:52:34,783
This was recreated       
from police footage.      

1127
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:37,619
It allows us to see things   
that they cannot        

1128
00:52:37,654 --> 00:52:40,055
or don't want us to see.

[breathing heavily]      

1130

Pika.             

1132
00:52:45,162 --> 00:52:46,995
It's me. I was with Harry   
in the crash.         

1133
00:52:47,030 --> 00:52:48,230
He needs my help.       

1134
00:52:51,268 --> 00:52:53,335
If Harry's alive,       
why didn't they find him?   

1135
00:53:01,278 --> 00:53:02,377
What is that?         

1136
00:53:02,412 --> 00:53:03,645
Mewtwo.            

1137
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:06,014
A man-made abomination     

1138
00:53:06,049 --> 00:53:08,350
created in a laboratory    
using DNA           

1139
00:53:08,385 --> 00:53:11,553
from the fossil remains    
of the Ancient Mew.      

1140
00:53:11,588 --> 00:53:12,988
I can't believe it.      

1141
00:53:13,023 --> 00:53:15,090
If that thing came from Mew,  

1142
00:53:15,125 --> 00:53:16,391
then we're looking at     

1143
00:53:16,426 --> 00:53:18,427
the most powerful Pokemon   
in the world.

[gasping]           

1146
00:53:24,334 --> 00:53:27,436
That's it.          
That's what happened to me.  

1147
00:53:27,471 --> 00:53:30,339
Mewtwo wiped my memory.    

1148
00:53:30,374 --> 00:53:31,373
But why?            

1149
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:38,013
Wait, wait, wait!       

1150
00:53:44,054 --> 00:53:47,556
Wait. Wait, wait.       
Where did it take him?     

1151
00:53:47,591 --> 00:53:49,925
That's for you to solve now.  

1152
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:54,163
Find Mewtwo          
and you will find your father. 

1153
00:53:56,933 --> 00:53:58,166
[exhales sharply]       

1154

[Detective Pikachu]      
Second chances        

1155
00:53:59,102 --> 00:54:00,636
are special things, kid.    

1156
00:54:00,671 --> 00:54:02,571
There's a lot we can make   
better if we crack this case. 

1157
00:54:02,606 --> 00:54:04,640
One question, though.     
Where are we going?      

1158
00:54:04,675 --> 00:54:06,041
I don't know, I'm just going. 

1159
00:54:06,076 --> 00:54:07,776
You gotta tell me where.    
You're the detective.     

1160
00:54:07,811 --> 00:54:11,046
Okay. If Roger Clifford is   
the key to all of this...   

1161
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:13,915
Then we need someone      
who has access to him.     

1162
00:54:13,950 --> 00:54:16,551
And we both know who that is, 
lover boy.          

1163
00:54:16,586 --> 00:54:17,953
Okay, come on, that's...    

1164
00:54:17,988 --> 00:54:19,922
Come on.           
Let's not start that again.  

1165
00:54:26,730 --> 00:54:28,130
-There she is.         
-[door closes]         

1166
00:54:28,165 --> 00:54:30,866
What's with the sunglasses?  
Can she see us?        

1167
00:54:30,901 --> 00:54:32,467
I don't think she can see us. 

1168
00:54:32,502 --> 00:54:35,371
-Hey. Thanks for coming.   
-[whispers] Don't talk to me. 

1169
00:54:36,506 --> 00:54:38,240
Okay.             

1170
00:54:38,275 --> 00:54:41,076
-What happens now?       
-Just act casual.       

1171
00:54:41,111 --> 00:54:43,545
But don't look at me.     

1172
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:46,148
There's nothing really casual 
about this.          

1173
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:48,017
Look at this.         

1174
00:54:49,386 --> 00:54:51,053
-Oh, shit.           
-Sorry. That was my fault.   

1175
00:54:51,088 --> 00:54:52,721
-[both] Ow!          
-Sorry. I'm sorry.       

1176
00:54:52,756 --> 00:54:54,056
Oh, this is working out great. 

1177
00:54:54,091 --> 00:54:55,223
Why don't you just      
have her sit over here.    

1178
00:54:55,258 --> 00:54:56,525
You wanna just        
come sit with us?       

1179
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:57,626
I should never have      
encouraged you.        

1180
00:54:57,661 --> 00:54:58,860
You have no chance.      

1181
00:54:58,895 --> 00:55:00,028
I got access          
to Roger's computer.      

1182
00:55:00,063 --> 00:55:01,296
Oh, wow, how'd you do that?  

1183
00:55:01,331 --> 00:55:02,931
Spilled a cappuccino      
on his lap.          

1184
00:55:02,966 --> 00:55:04,132
Eh, that sounds like      
a waste of coffee.       

1185
00:55:04,167 --> 00:55:05,567
I searched through       
all his records.        

1186
00:55:05,602 --> 00:55:07,202
I targeted the property rights 
in the region         

1187
00:55:07,237 --> 00:55:08,737
and I cross-checked that    
with city records       

1188
00:55:08,772 --> 00:55:11,606
for any Clifford-financed   
businesses until I found it.  

1189
00:55:11,641 --> 00:55:14,142
May I present PCL:       

1190
00:55:14,177 --> 00:55:16,545
A Pokemon genetic       
research facility.       

1191
00:55:16,580 --> 00:55:17,679
But that's not all.      

1192
00:55:17,714 --> 00:55:18,847
[whispers] She's good.     

1193
00:55:18,882 --> 00:55:21,016
Last week,          
PCL had an "accident"     

1194
00:55:21,051 --> 00:55:22,551
and had to shut down      
their entire facility.     

1195
00:55:22,586 --> 00:55:25,620
That's the same night     
Harry Goodman went missing.  

1196
00:55:25,655 --> 00:55:27,189
No one knows what happened.  

1197
00:55:27,224 --> 00:55:29,658
Total media blackout.     

1198
00:55:29,693 --> 00:55:31,126
What does it all mean?     

1199
00:55:31,161 --> 00:55:32,894
I don't know.         
This is very exciting.     

1200
00:55:32,929 --> 00:55:34,229
-Are you excited?       
-[chuckles] Yeah.       

1201
00:55:34,264 --> 00:55:36,198
I think he just peed a little. 

1202
00:55:36,233 --> 00:55:38,367
Oh, nope. That's me.      
That was me.          

1203
00:55:38,402 --> 00:55:41,703
So, um, there's a cover-up?  

1204
00:55:41,738 --> 00:55:43,005
Mmm-hmm.            

1205
00:55:43,974 --> 00:55:46,141
But, er,            
what are they covering up?   

1206
00:55:47,411 --> 00:55:49,545
What do you say        
we go find out?        

1207
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:05,561
[new age music plays      
on car stereo]         

1208
00:56:06,263 --> 00:56:07,596
So let me get this right.   

1209
00:56:07,631 --> 00:56:09,731
We're forced to listen     
to this spa music       

1210
00:56:09,766 --> 00:56:12,601
so your head doesn't explode  
and kill us all.        

1211
00:56:12,636 --> 00:56:14,035
Psyduck.            

1212
00:56:14,070 --> 00:56:16,505
[Lucy] Your Pikachu      
is so unusual.        

1213
00:56:17,007 --> 00:56:18,573
Psyduck.            

1214
00:56:18,608 --> 00:56:20,942
Hey, you put that down.    
I am not giving you a massage. 

1215
00:56:20,977 --> 00:56:22,344
Psyduck.            

1216
00:56:22,379 --> 00:56:24,813
I have never known a Pokemon  
to wear a hat.         

1217
00:56:24,848 --> 00:56:26,248
Yeah, he's weird.       
He's so weird.        

1218
00:56:26,283 --> 00:56:27,482
[Psyduck] Psyduck.       

1219
00:56:27,517 --> 00:56:29,084
Of course I care        
about my partner's life.    

1220
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:30,685
Fine, fine. Hand it over.   

1221
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:31,753
[Psyduck moaning]       

1222
00:56:31,788 --> 00:56:33,121
[Tim] What are you doing?   

1223
00:56:33,156 --> 00:56:34,790
[Lucy] What?          

1224
00:56:34,825 --> 00:56:36,057
[stammering] Nothing.     

1225
00:56:36,092 --> 00:56:38,660
I was actually wondering    
who this was.         

1226
00:56:40,197 --> 00:56:43,532
It's PCL's chief scientist,  
Dr. Anne Laurent.       

1227
00:56:43,567 --> 00:56:45,467
I bet this is the doctor    
Shirtless was talking about.  

1228
00:56:45,502 --> 00:56:46,902
[Lucy] She lost        
her university grant      

1229
00:56:46,937 --> 00:56:48,303
over experimentation      
of Pokemon           

1230
00:56:48,338 --> 00:56:50,338
because she was trying to   
control their minds.     

1231
00:56:50,373 --> 00:56:51,506
Oh, wow.            

1232
00:56:51,541 --> 00:56:53,842
She's essentially       
a neurologist for Pokemon.   

1233
00:56:53,877 --> 00:56:55,177
Maybe she could weigh in    

1234
00:56:55,212 --> 00:56:56,378
on the long-term       
psychological effects     

1235
00:56:56,413 --> 00:56:58,447
of being strapped       
into a baby seat       

1236
00:56:58,482 --> 00:57:00,549
-next to a bomb.        
-[Psyduck] Hmm?        

1237
00:57:04,688 --> 00:57:06,188
[Lucy] This is it.       

1238
00:57:09,025 --> 00:57:10,392
Look at the signs.       

1239
00:57:11,795 --> 00:57:14,062
Must have been         
a really bad accident.     

1240
00:57:14,097 --> 00:57:15,864
[Detective Pikachu]      
That's what they        
want you to believe.      

1241
00:57:15,899 --> 00:57:17,866
Whoever staged this      
did an excellent job.     

1242
00:57:17,901 --> 00:57:20,068
Those signs are the perfect  
scarecrow for suckers.    

1243
00:57:20,103 --> 00:57:21,770
Yeah, well,          
they're working on me.     

1244
00:57:21,805 --> 00:57:24,206
Kid, this dame's       
looking for danger.      

1245
00:57:24,241 --> 00:57:25,474
You want to win her over,   

1246
00:57:25,509 --> 00:57:27,008
you gotta lead her       
straight to it.        

1247
00:57:27,043 --> 00:57:29,611
First of all, women don't like 
to be called "dame".      

1248
00:57:29,646 --> 00:57:33,882
Second, women appreciate calm, 
er, level-headed        

1249
00:57:33,917 --> 00:57:36,384
and responsible        
decision-making.        

1250
00:57:36,419 --> 00:57:39,054
What is she doing? Hey, hey!  

1251
00:57:39,689 --> 00:57:40,956
Hey!              

1252
00:57:40,991 --> 00:57:42,958
Lucy, what are you doing?   

1253
00:57:42,993 --> 00:57:46,528
I'm, er, I'm cutting the fence 
so that we can slip through.  

1254
00:57:46,563 --> 00:57:47,996
[Tim stammers]         
Where did you get those?    

1255
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:49,297
[Lucy] Oh,          
don't worry about it.     

1256
00:57:49,332 --> 00:57:50,832
[Detective Pikachu]      
After you, sir.        

1257
00:57:50,867 --> 00:57:52,300
-[Psyduck] Psyduck.      
-[Detective Pikachu] No? Okay. 

1258
00:57:52,335 --> 00:57:53,268
I'll go first.         
Whatever's most calming.    

1259
00:57:53,303 --> 00:57:54,603
[Psyduck] Hmm, Psyduck.    

1260
00:58:11,788 --> 00:58:12,954
Okay.             

1261
00:58:12,989 --> 00:58:14,256
[grunts]            

1262
00:58:14,291 --> 00:58:17,092
[whimpers] Psyduck. Psyduck.  

1263
00:58:19,429 --> 00:58:20,429
[grunts]            

1264
00:58:21,698 --> 00:58:22,698
Oh.              

1265
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:26,468
It's okay.           
You can stay up there.     

1266
00:58:33,877 --> 00:58:36,578
[Detective Pikachu] I may have 
amnesia, but I'm pretty sure  

1267
00:58:36,613 --> 00:58:39,214
this is the worst idea     
anyone's ever had.       

1268
00:58:42,018 --> 00:58:43,552
What is that?         

1269
00:58:44,921 --> 00:58:46,355
I'm not sure.         

1270
00:58:49,059 --> 00:58:51,693
-[all gasp]

1272

[Lucy] It's Greninja.     

1273
00:58:55,231 --> 00:58:57,098

"Power enhancement"?      

1276
00:59:02,672 --> 00:59:04,673
They were experimenting    
on them.           

1277
00:59:04,708 --> 00:59:05,707
But why?            

1278
00:59:05,742 --> 00:59:07,375
If Roger Clifford's      
behind this,         

1279
00:59:07,410 --> 00:59:10,145
what's he doing        
experimenting on Pokemon?   

1280

Maybe it hasn't started yet.  

1287
00:59:34,871 --> 00:59:39,507
It's like they're trying to  
manipulate Pokemon evolution. 

1288
00:59:39,542 --> 00:59:41,977
Is that even possible?     

1289

I don't know.         

1290

I need to document       
all of this, though.

Really bad stuff.

this was staged?

01:01:23,413 --> 01:01:25,280
After much trial and error   

1312
01:01:25,315 --> 01:01:27,248
we perfected a stable method  

1313
01:01:27,283 --> 01:01:30,652
to extract Mewtwo's DNA.    

1314
01:01:30,687 --> 01:01:32,854
It's Mewtwo. No, wait.

from this place?

proven successful.

01:01:41,631 --> 01:01:44,532
The inhalant          
results in confusion

Mewtwo.            

1342

It escaped nearly 20 years ago 
from the Kanto region.     

1343

Fortunately, our benefactor's

hired a specialist       
to track it down.

Good luck, Detective Goodman. 

1346
01:03:15,658 --> 01:03:17,826
That's why Mewtwo took Harry. 

1347
01:03:17,861 --> 01:03:20,128
It was revenge        
for being captured.

This doesn't make any sense.
