1
00:01:45,906 --> 00:01:47,305
They're outside.

2
00:01:48,642 --> 00:01:51,176
<i>Alert. Condition: Red.</i>

3
00:01:51,211 --> 00:01:52,444
We're losing power

4
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:53,812
in the containment chamber.

5
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:10,589
You hear that?

6
00:03:10,624 --> 00:03:12,090
Something's close.

7
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,393
See? This is what I'm talking about.

8
00:03:15,428 --> 00:03:16,561
My heart is pounding.

9
00:03:16,596 --> 00:03:18,263
Get down, get down.

10
00:03:23,103 --> 00:03:25,837
Cubone.

11
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:30,842
A Cubone?

12
00:03:34,614 --> 00:03:36,915
We're not catching you a Pokemon, are we?

13
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:38,216
What?

14
00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:39,918
Tell me you didn't plan this, Jack.

15
00:03:39,953 --> 00:03:41,219
Jack, tell me

16
00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:42,654
- you didn't plan this.    - Are you serious?

17
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:45,557
How dare you. Okay? Of course not. Come on.

18
00:03:46,493 --> 00:03:48,060
Okay, maybe.

19
00:03:49,029 --> 00:03:50,362
There was a full moon last night

20
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:51,896
and my mom heard it crying its eyes out.

21
00:03:51,931 --> 00:03:53,298
She thought I was having a nightmare,

22
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:55,300
so she brought me a glass of warm milk.

23
00:03:55,335 --> 00:03:57,636
Dude, I thought you wanted to, you know, hang out

24
00:03:57,671 --> 00:03:58,770
and relive the good old days.

25
00:03:58,805 --> 00:03:59,838
Like when we were kids.

26
00:03:59,873 --> 00:04:02,807
I do. But just look at it.

27
00:04:02,842 --> 00:04:05,810
That is the perfect Pokemon for you.

28
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:10,649
Jack, I'm not looking for a Pokemon. I've told you this.

29
00:04:10,684 --> 00:04:12,884
I've thought long and hard about this, okay?

30
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,252
Water-type is not right for you.

31
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:15,787
Neither is Fire-type. But Cubone is--

32
00:04:15,822 --> 00:04:16,855
Lonely.

33
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:18,957
Exactly.

34
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:21,192
Okay, thank you, Jack. Thank you for that.

35
00:04:21,227 --> 00:04:22,827
Are there any other emotional truth-bombs

36
00:04:22,862 --> 00:04:24,329
you wanna drop on me?

37
00:04:24,364 --> 00:04:26,831
Maybe later. But right now the truth is in my hands.

38
00:04:30,303 --> 00:04:33,171
- Just give me the Ball.    - Yes. Yes!

39
00:04:33,206 --> 00:04:36,441
Okay, remember, catching a Pokemon is not about skill.

40
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:37,509
So you can do this.

41
00:04:37,544 --> 00:04:38,543
Good pep talk.

42
00:04:38,578 --> 00:04:40,445
Okay. It has to choose you, too.

43
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:43,381
So make it wanna be your partner.

44
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:45,784
Hey, Cubone. What's up, buddy?

45
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:46,851
You know,

46
00:04:46,886 --> 00:04:48,920
not everyone can pull off

47
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:51,723
wearing the skull of their dead relative,

48
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:54,459
but, you know, you sure can.

49
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:58,763
Okay, he didn't like that.

50
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:00,399
He did not like that.

51
00:05:02,602 --> 00:05:03,668
Jack.

52
00:05:04,738 --> 00:05:06,071
Throw it!

53
00:05:06,106 --> 00:05:07,439
Throw the Ball.

54
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:09,040
Like a man.

55
00:05:13,513 --> 00:05:15,480
Uh-oh. Cubone.

56
00:05:16,015 --> 00:05:17,215
Cubone!

57
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,187
I did it!

58
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:25,324
Still got it.

59
00:05:29,195 --> 00:05:31,196
The light's not green.

60
00:05:31,231 --> 00:05:32,630
It still hasn't turned green yet, Jack.

61
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:33,998
That's bad, right?

62
00:05:34,033 --> 00:05:35,867
Run!

63
00:05:39,606 --> 00:05:42,040
- It didn't choose me!    - Run!

64
00:05:42,075 --> 00:05:44,809
- It didn't choose me, Jack!    - I can see that!

65
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:46,044
I'm not its choice!

66
00:05:51,718 --> 00:05:54,519
Cubone!

67
00:05:54,554 --> 00:05:56,121
<i>That was one angry Cubone.</i>

68
00:05:56,156 --> 00:05:58,289
<i>He reminded me a lot of my mom.</i>

69
00:05:58,324 --> 00:06:00,291
So, um, I don't know if this is gonna sound

70
00:06:00,326 --> 00:06:01,726
corny or whatever--

71
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:04,028
Just say it, Jack. I'm too tired to be angry.

72
00:06:04,063 --> 00:06:05,663
I'm worried about you.

73
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:07,098
This again?

74
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:08,733
Hey, listen, everyone we know has left town

75
00:06:08,768 --> 00:06:10,068
and now I'm leaving, too.

76
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:11,302
Yeah, but that's okay.

77
00:06:11,337 --> 00:06:12,404
You gotta do what's best for you

78
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:13,671
with the time that you got.

79
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:14,839
That's what I'm doing.

80
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:16,674
You know, I'm crushing it at work.

81
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:18,910
I'm gonna get a promotion real soon.

82
00:06:18,945 --> 00:06:22,080
What's the promotion for an insurance appraiser?

83
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:24,382
"Senior insurance appraiser"?

84
00:06:24,417 --> 00:06:26,217
No, actually, that's two steps up

85
00:06:26,252 --> 00:06:27,619
above where I'm at right now.

86
00:06:27,654 --> 00:06:29,220
You're gonna make me throw up.

87
00:06:29,255 --> 00:06:31,122
That's not a real thing.

88
00:06:31,157 --> 00:06:33,691
Oh, I finally have service.

89
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:34,926
Wait, five voicemails?

90
00:06:34,961 --> 00:06:36,661
Why would I have five voicemails?

91
00:06:36,696 --> 00:06:39,097
Maybe it's an insurance emergency.

92
00:06:42,669 --> 00:06:44,035
Who is it?

93
00:06:46,506 --> 00:06:50,542
Um, it's the Ryme City Police Department.

94
00:06:51,377 --> 00:06:53,278
There was an accident.

95
00:07:25,078 --> 00:07:26,478
Please don't.

96
00:07:26,513 --> 00:07:28,146
Mmm.

97
00:07:28,181 --> 00:07:31,282
I actually meant, "Please do". Thank you.

98
00:07:31,317 --> 00:07:34,319
Thank you. You have a very generous tongue.

99
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,624
Does this Lickitung belong to anyone?

100
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,460
Anybody? No?

101
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:44,128
<i>Thank you for travelling with us.</i>

102
00:07:44,163 --> 00:07:47,232
<i>Please sit back and watch this short informational video</i>

103
00:07:47,267 --> 00:07:49,801
<i>welcoming you to Ryme City.</i>

104
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:51,436
<i>Throughout history,</i>

105
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,471
<i>Pokemon have been part of our world.</i>

106
00:07:53,506 --> 00:07:54,939
<i>Squirtle.</i>

107
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:56,674
<i>Early humans used to catch them</i>

108
00:07:56,709 --> 00:07:59,911
<i>and train them to use their unique powers</i>

109
00:07:59,946 --> 00:08:02,313
<i>for the common good.</i>

110
00:08:02,348 --> 00:08:03,915
<i>This relationship evolved</i>

111
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:07,686
<i>into what we now refer to as Pokemon battles.</i>

112
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:13,958
<i>One man changed all of this.</i>

113
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:15,460
<i>Howard Clifford,</i>

114
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:19,330
<i>founder and chairman of Clifford Industries.</i>

115
00:08:19,365 --> 00:08:22,300
<i>Diagnosed with a rare degenerative disease,</i>

116
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:24,168
<i>he resigned from his corporation</i>

117
00:08:24,203 --> 00:08:26,704
<i>and searched the world for a cure.</i>

118
00:08:26,739 --> 00:08:30,141
<i>And it turned out that the cure I was looking for</i>

119
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:33,778
<i>was for me to evolve into a better version of myself.</i>

120
00:08:33,813 --> 00:08:35,413
<i>And I discovered how to do that</i>

121
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:36,948
<i>through a partnership with Pokemon.</i>

122
00:08:36,983 --> 00:08:41,319
<i>And he wanted to share that discovery with the world.</i>

123
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:42,687
<i>This is what inspired</i>

124
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:44,822
<i>Howard Clifford to build Ryme City,</i>

125
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:49,460
<i>a place where humans and Pokemon can live side by side.</i>

126
00:08:49,495 --> 00:08:53,565
<i>Unlike other regions, where Pokemon live in the wild,</i>

127
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,668
<i>here, we live and work together.</i>

128
00:08:56,703 --> 00:09:01,139
<i>No battles. No Trainers. No Poke Balls.</i>

129
00:09:01,174 --> 00:09:04,909
<i>A stronger, more harmonious world.</i>

130
00:09:04,944 --> 00:09:11,049
<i>From all our citizens: Welcome to Ryme City.</i>

131
00:09:11,084 --> 00:09:13,318
Char! Charmander!

132
00:10:01,567 --> 00:10:03,635
<i>Fighting fires wouldn't be the same</i>

133
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:05,303
<i>without their Squirtle partners.</i>

134
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:08,940
<i>Squirtle, Squirtle. Squirtle, Squirtle.</i>

135
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:34,999
Snubbull.

136
00:10:41,107 --> 00:10:42,173
Hi, Tim.

137
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:43,575
Lieutenant Yoshida.

138
00:10:45,912 --> 00:10:48,646
Your dad was the best of the best.

139
00:10:48,681 --> 00:10:51,816
He was a legend in this precinct.

140
00:10:51,851 --> 00:10:55,653
Thank you. Thank you for saying that.

141
00:10:55,688 --> 00:10:59,924
It was a terrible tragedy, losing him and his partner.

142
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:01,125
His partner?

143
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,493
His Pokemon.

144
00:11:02,528 --> 00:11:03,828
Oh, I didn't…

145
00:11:03,863 --> 00:11:06,197
Snubbull.

146
00:11:06,232 --> 00:11:08,032
I'm sorry, is yours mad at me?

147
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:09,934
- Snubbull?    - Yeah.

148
00:11:09,969 --> 00:11:11,836
He may look grumpy on the outside,

149
00:11:11,871 --> 00:11:15,273
but I assure you, he is adorable on the inside.

150
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,277
If you don't mind me asking,

151
00:11:19,312 --> 00:11:21,846
how come you don't have a Pokemon?

152
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:24,282
I thought I remember Harry saying

153
00:11:24,317 --> 00:11:27,251
you wanted to be a Pokemon Trainer when you were young.

154
00:11:27,286 --> 00:11:29,587
Yeah, that didn't really work out.

155
00:11:29,622 --> 00:11:32,924
Uh, I work in insurance now, so…

156
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:34,492
I understand.

157
00:11:35,328 --> 00:11:36,894
But, Tim,

158
00:11:36,929 --> 00:11:39,097
please don't put this all on yourself.

159
00:11:39,132 --> 00:11:42,300
No one should go through this type of thing alone.

160
00:11:42,335 --> 00:11:44,769
If you are anything like your dad--

161
00:11:44,804 --> 00:11:45,870
I'm not.

162
00:11:47,473 --> 00:11:49,440
I was just really raised by my grandmother.

163
00:11:49,475 --> 00:11:50,875
Do you have the spare keys for his apartment?

164
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:53,044
I should go wrap things up there.

165
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:54,579
Of course.

166
00:11:55,081 --> 00:11:56,081
Of course.

167
00:11:58,251 --> 00:12:00,218
- Here's his address.    - Awesome.

168
00:12:00,253 --> 00:12:01,753
I can take you over if you want.

169
00:12:01,788 --> 00:12:05,824
No. Nope. I'm all good. Thank you so much.

170
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:10,528
Tim.

171
00:12:13,966 --> 00:12:15,366
This job,

172
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:17,702
it demands a lot.

173
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:20,204
But you were on his mind every day.

174
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:24,042
He loved you more than anything else in the world.

175
00:12:29,816 --> 00:12:33,384
Uh, it was nice to meet you, Lieutenant.

176
00:13:34,413 --> 00:13:36,247
Excuse me.

177
00:13:36,282 --> 00:13:38,516
Okay.

178
00:13:52,098 --> 00:13:53,764
Psyduck!

179
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:54,799
Psyduck.

180
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:59,503
Are you trying to rob me, or just annoy me?

181
00:13:59,538 --> 00:14:01,206
- Psyduck.    - He's with me.

182
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:06,410
- We need to talk.    - We do?

183
00:14:06,445 --> 00:14:07,578
I've been waiting to see

184
00:14:07,613 --> 00:14:09,113
who would open up that mailbox.

185
00:14:09,148 --> 00:14:12,550
You just walked into quite a story.

186
00:14:12,585 --> 00:14:16,520
Stories like this spread fear. And they're afraid of fear.

187
00:14:16,555 --> 00:14:17,855
But I don't fear fear.

188
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:19,156
I walk the walk and I talk the talk.

189
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:20,825
And I'm willing to do whatever it takes

190
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,528
to get the honest scoop, and that's the hard truth.

191
00:14:25,298 --> 00:14:28,933
I'm sorry. Who are you?

192
00:14:28,968 --> 00:14:31,969
Lucy Stevens. Reporter for CNM.

193
00:14:32,004 --> 00:14:35,073
Oh. You seem kinda young for that.

194
00:14:35,841 --> 00:14:37,475
I work for the CNM blog,

195
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:39,076
making Pokemon listicles all day, okay?

196
00:14:39,111 --> 00:14:41,345
- Top 10 Cutest Pokemon.    - Yeah, my grandma loves those.

197
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,080
Yeah, news flash: they're all cute.

198
00:14:43,115 --> 00:14:44,115
Such a waste of time

199
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:45,583
for someone with my nose for a story.

200
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,119
Oh, no, no, not now, Psyduck.

201
00:14:48,154 --> 00:14:49,520
I'm working a source. Just one more minute.

202
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:51,923
Okay, I'm gonna…

203
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:53,758
I'm gonna need you to go on record and tell me

204
00:14:53,793 --> 00:14:56,127
everything you know about Harry Goodman.

205
00:14:58,130 --> 00:14:59,196
Wait, what?

206
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:02,266
Harry was onto something big. Real big.

207
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:03,668
And then all of a sudden,

208
00:15:03,703 --> 00:15:05,569
his car crashes over a bridge. I think not.

209
00:15:05,604 --> 00:15:07,705
Something's rotten, and I'm gonna get to the bottom of it.

210
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,407
Hey, look, I barely know the guy.

211
00:15:09,442 --> 00:15:11,342
- I haven't seen him in years.    - Where's your Pokemon partner?

212
00:15:11,377 --> 00:15:13,911
I don't have one. Why does everyone keep asking me that?

213
00:15:13,946 --> 00:15:15,346
Loner. Probably hiding something.

214
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:16,647
Okay. I'm gonna go.

215
00:15:16,682 --> 00:15:18,416
Hey.

216
00:15:18,451 --> 00:15:20,184
I may only be an unpaid intern,

217
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:21,852
but I can smell a story.

218
00:15:21,887 --> 00:15:23,721
And I'm going to find it.

219
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:25,223
Okay. You do that.

220
00:15:28,461 --> 00:15:30,628
Come on, Psyduck. Let's go.

221
00:15:30,663 --> 00:15:31,930
Psyduck.

222
00:15:47,913 --> 00:15:49,246
<i>Who is it?</i>

223
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:50,614
Hello?

224
00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:53,184
<i>It's me. Snakes. I got the stuff.</i>

225
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:55,753
<i>Leave it on the doorstep</i>

226
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:57,288
<i>and get the hell out of here.</i>

227
00:15:57,323 --> 00:16:00,124
<i>All right, Johnny, but what about my money?</i>

228
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:03,795
Still with the old detective movies.

229
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:54,679
What?

230
00:16:56,615 --> 00:16:59,150
What? What is that stuff?

231
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:29,880
"Dear Tim. I could do better if you give me a chance.

232
00:17:29,915 --> 00:17:32,984
I'll always have a place for you to stay."

233
00:17:34,587 --> 00:17:36,320
<i>The train on platform…</i>

234
00:17:36,355 --> 00:17:38,556
Your father will pick you up from the station.

235
00:17:38,591 --> 00:17:40,324
I'm not going.

236
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:42,159
- What?    - I don't wanna go.

237
00:17:42,194 --> 00:17:44,896
<i>This is home. I wanna stay here with you, Grandma.</i>

238
00:18:07,386 --> 00:18:08,820
Oh, man.

239
00:18:10,723 --> 00:18:13,324
<i>This is the most important day of my life.</i>

240
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:14,692
I know, Tim.

241
00:18:14,727 --> 00:18:18,329
But your mother had to see the doctor. It couldn't wait.

242
00:18:27,239 --> 00:18:28,439
Harry.

243
00:18:45,558 --> 00:18:46,958
Someone there?

244
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:51,896
Hello?

245
00:19:01,073 --> 00:19:02,373
Oh.

246
00:19:02,408 --> 00:19:03,908
Ahh! That's a sprain.

247
00:19:10,382 --> 00:19:11,983
Okay, okay, okay.

248
00:19:13,886 --> 00:19:15,386
Whoever you are,

249
00:19:16,522 --> 00:19:18,890
I know how to use this.

250
00:19:26,432 --> 00:19:28,265
It's a Pikachu?

251
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,300
Aw, jeez.

252
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:32,937
Hey, little guy, how did you get in here?

253
00:19:32,972 --> 00:19:36,840
I know you can't understand me,

254
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:38,742
but put down the stapler,

255
00:19:38,777 --> 00:19:43,481
or I will electrocute you.

256
00:19:46,118 --> 00:19:47,718
Did you just talk?

257
00:19:47,753 --> 00:19:49,954
Whoa. Did you just understand me?

258
00:19:49,989 --> 00:19:51,455
Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

259
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:53,691
That is heavy eye contact right there. You heard me.

260
00:19:53,726 --> 00:19:54,992
- No, no, no.    - Yes, you did.

261
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:56,527
- Oh, my God. This is amazing!    - Stop!

262
00:19:56,562 --> 00:19:58,128
- You can understand me.    - Stop talking. Stop!

263
00:19:58,163 --> 00:19:59,630
I have been so lonely.

264
00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:02,166
- I'm gonna throw up.    - No, kid. I need your help.

265
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:04,134
- I'm gonna throw up.    - I'm in serious trouble.

266
00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:05,903
I need you to listen.

267
00:20:05,938 --> 00:20:07,972
-No, no, no, no. Excuse me, Aipom,

268
00:20:08,007 --> 00:20:09,573
we're having a private conversation here, please.

269
00:20:09,608 --> 00:20:10,941
Stop talking.

270
00:20:10,976 --> 00:20:12,243
- You're a hallucination!    - You're a hallucination!

271
00:20:12,278 --> 00:20:14,712
And, you! Out! Shoo! Go!

272
00:20:14,747 --> 00:20:16,247
I'd tread lightly there, chief.

273
00:20:16,282 --> 00:20:18,182
That Aipom don't look right.

274
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:19,250
Ahh!

275
00:20:19,285 --> 00:20:20,751
No! Hey! Hey!

276
00:20:20,786 --> 00:20:22,419
Get off him, whack-job.

277
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:26,423
Get up, kid. He's coming back around.

278
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:27,925
Okay, here's what you wanna do.

279
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,827
Okay, you wanna bite him. You wanna scream.

280
00:20:29,862 --> 00:20:32,363
We're playing charades. We're not playing charades.

281
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:34,164
- Okay, I'm gonna get a knife.    - Not the knife!

282
00:20:34,199 --> 00:20:37,001
Okay, bad idea with the knife. I'll find something else.

283
00:20:37,036 --> 00:20:38,535
Eat this!

284
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:41,739
You are so welcome. He was just a hungry little guy…

285
00:20:41,774 --> 00:20:44,541
Oh, my God!

286
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:46,944
Come on, kid. Let's move.

287
00:20:50,683 --> 00:20:51,815
To the roof!

288
00:21:02,361 --> 00:21:05,095
Brilliant idea! You hold the door.

289
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:06,664
- I'll go get help.    - What?

290
00:21:06,699 --> 00:21:09,634
Help! Help! Oh, my God! Help!

291
00:21:14,006 --> 00:21:15,339
Oh, sh…

292
00:21:16,742 --> 00:21:19,376
Help! Help! Oh, my God, help!

293
00:21:19,411 --> 00:21:23,981
Oh, he's being eaten alive! He's being eaten alive!

294
00:21:24,016 --> 00:21:25,949
A man is dying!

295
00:21:35,594 --> 00:21:37,695
No one's coming. People are so insensitive.

296
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:39,763
Uh-oh. Put your pants back on

297
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:41,232
and run like the wind.

298
00:21:42,835 --> 00:21:45,503
Blazing speed! Blazing speed!

299
00:21:47,673 --> 00:21:51,408
No, they seem to be attracted to your increasing nudeness.

300
00:21:51,443 --> 00:21:53,177
Okay.

301
00:21:53,212 --> 00:21:54,978
All right, we're jumping down here.

302
00:21:55,013 --> 00:21:56,847
No! No! I'm not going in the trash chute.

303
00:21:56,882 --> 00:21:58,782
Good call. Let me know how it goes

304
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:00,551
with the super crazy Pokemon.

305
00:22:00,586 --> 00:22:01,885
You died a hero.

306
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:11,195
Way to stick the landing, kid.

307
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:12,463
Leave me alone!

308
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,735
Oh. Looks like someone's back in a good mood.

309
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:20,871
Run! Rabid Aipom!

310
00:22:20,906 --> 00:22:22,606
Look out! Run!

311
00:22:22,641 --> 00:22:26,643
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! They're… Go! They…

312
00:22:28,213 --> 00:22:31,215
I think pants are gonna do you a lot of good right now.

313
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:35,219
Shoo! Go.

314
00:22:35,254 --> 00:22:36,620
You know, I pictured you

315
00:22:36,655 --> 00:22:38,555
as a bit of a briefs guy, but those are nice.

316
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:42,192
Me? I don't wear underwear, you know? I'm not modest.

317
00:22:42,227 --> 00:22:43,727
Excuse me, excuse me, hi. Sorry.

318
00:22:43,762 --> 00:22:45,429
Uh, you can hear him, right? You can hear him talking?

319
00:22:45,464 --> 00:22:47,531
- Pika-Pika. Pika. Pikachu.    - Aw.

320
00:22:47,566 --> 00:22:50,667
Yeah. Pika-Pika. Pika. He's adorable.

321
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:52,703
You're adorable. They can't understand me, kid.

322
00:22:52,738 --> 00:22:56,340
It's me. It's that stuff that I put up my nose.

323
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:58,175
Not like that. No, it was a gas.

324
00:22:58,210 --> 00:22:59,510
- I was breathing gas.    - Hey, hey, hey.

325
00:22:59,545 --> 00:23:00,878
Accidentally. I was accidentally…

326
00:23:00,913 --> 00:23:02,746
Ix-nay on the gas-ay.

327
00:23:02,781 --> 00:23:04,314
Unless you want Johnny Law to give you

328
00:23:04,349 --> 00:23:05,616
a one-way ticket to the hoosegow, let's move.

329
00:23:05,651 --> 00:23:06,617
No one else can hear him?

330
00:23:06,652 --> 00:23:07,918
This is a first for me, too, kid.

331
00:23:07,953 --> 00:23:09,219
He's saying words.

332
00:23:09,254 --> 00:23:10,287
Try to talk to people all the time.

333
00:23:10,322 --> 00:23:11,255
All they hear is "Pika-Pika".

334
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:12,556
They pat me or kiss me,

335
00:23:12,591 --> 00:23:14,258
stick a finger in me. It's really gross.

336
00:23:14,293 --> 00:23:15,826
Can no one else hear him?

337
00:23:15,861 --> 00:23:17,928
Can you hear him talking? Do you hear him saying words?

338
00:23:17,963 --> 00:23:19,596
What are you not getting here, kid?

339
00:23:19,631 --> 00:23:21,298
You're the only one who can hear me.

340
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:23,300
- It's like destiny.    - It's not destiny.

341
00:23:23,335 --> 00:23:24,802
Then why were you in that apartment?

342
00:23:24,837 --> 00:23:27,371
It's my father's place. That's why I was there.

343
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:30,074
- Why were you there?    - You're Harry's son?

344
00:23:33,645 --> 00:23:35,379
How do you know his name?

345
00:23:43,322 --> 00:23:45,556
You're Harry's Pokemon partner?

346
00:23:46,859 --> 00:23:48,459
You want a coffee?

347
00:23:50,028 --> 00:23:51,929
'Cause I could use a coffee. I mean…

348
00:23:51,964 --> 00:23:54,031
Yeah. Let's get a coffee.

349
00:23:54,066 --> 00:23:56,133
Yeah. Come on.

350
00:24:08,714 --> 00:24:11,248
<i>So there I was in the middle of nowhere</i>

351
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:13,517
<i>with a bad case of the forgetsies.</i>

352
00:24:13,552 --> 00:24:15,319
The only clue to my past is Harry's name

353
00:24:15,354 --> 00:24:17,321
and address inside this hat.

354
00:24:17,356 --> 00:24:19,156
So I made my way to the apartment

355
00:24:19,191 --> 00:24:20,791
and that's when I found you.

356
00:24:20,826 --> 00:24:23,527
<i>♪Jigglypuff♪</i>

357
00:24:23,562 --> 00:24:24,995
I don't know. Maybe Harry got in too deep.

358
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:26,296
Deep in what?

359
00:24:26,331 --> 00:24:27,764
You know, mixed up with the wrong crowd,

360
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:30,434
that kinda thing. Happens to the best of us.

361
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:32,769
The debts pile up. The walls close in.

362
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:35,539
Right becomes wrong. Wrong becomes wrong.

363
00:24:35,574 --> 00:24:37,241
- Wait, who you calling?    - No one.

364
00:24:37,276 --> 00:24:40,143
Yeah, that sounds great. This menu looks really nice.

365
00:24:40,178 --> 00:24:41,545
Wait, I'm confused.

366
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:43,213
Are you hearing other voices besides mine?

367
00:24:43,248 --> 00:24:44,481
All I wanna know is why I can understand you.

368
00:24:44,516 --> 00:24:46,116
Ho! Can't help you there, kid.

369
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:49,720
Like I said, I have amnesia. Can't remember a darn thing.

370
00:24:49,755 --> 00:24:51,321
Okay, so you're a talking Pikachu

371
00:24:51,356 --> 00:24:53,090
with no memories, who's addicted to caffeine.

372
00:24:53,125 --> 00:24:56,426
I could stop whenever I want. These are just choices.

373
00:24:56,461 --> 00:24:57,895
Another round. Extra shot.

374
00:24:57,930 --> 00:24:59,463
Black as night. Thank you, sweetie.

375
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:00,697
Ludicolo!

376
00:25:00,732 --> 00:25:02,399
Look, I'm a great detective.

377
00:25:02,434 --> 00:25:03,901
But I can't solve my own mystery if I have no memory.

378
00:25:03,936 --> 00:25:05,402
Then how do you even know you're a detective?

379
00:25:05,437 --> 00:25:08,005
Well, I can feel that in my jellies.

380
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,373
What is that? What is that?

381
00:25:09,408 --> 00:25:11,041
It's the jellies. It's that thing, you know?

382
00:25:11,076 --> 00:25:13,911
You feel it when you really believe in something

383
00:25:13,946 --> 00:25:16,113
despite everyone telling you you're wrong.

384
00:25:16,148 --> 00:25:18,081
Which is why I need to find Harry.

385
00:25:18,116 --> 00:25:19,449
He's the key to my past.

386
00:25:19,484 --> 00:25:21,418
- Ludicolo.    - Thanks, doll.

387
00:25:21,453 --> 00:25:25,055
I got some bad news for you 'cause, uh, Harry's dead.

388
00:25:26,992 --> 00:25:31,395
What? No. No, no, no. No, Harry ain't dead.

389
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:34,197
No, Harry is dead. You're wrong. I'm sorry.

390
00:25:34,232 --> 00:25:35,699
I saw in the police report that he's dead.

391
00:25:35,734 --> 00:25:37,334
Just 'cause the cops say he's dead--

392
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:38,535
It means that he's legally dead.

393
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:40,838
Really? Did they find a body?

394
00:25:42,107 --> 00:25:43,640
Oh, I didn't think so.

395
00:25:43,675 --> 00:25:46,610
And, by the way, did that report also say that I'm dead?

396
00:25:46,645 --> 00:25:48,078
'Cause if I'm still alive and kicking,

397
00:25:48,113 --> 00:25:49,346
that means Harry's out there, too.

398
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:50,581
Case closed.

399
00:25:50,616 --> 00:25:52,583
But still open until I solve it.

400
00:25:52,618 --> 00:25:54,551
Okay, I'll bite. Solve what?

401
00:25:54,586 --> 00:25:55,986
Oh, I'm glad you're gonna bite.

402
00:25:56,021 --> 00:25:58,155
All right. Here it is.

403
00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:00,457
Harry faked his own death.

404
00:26:00,492 --> 00:26:03,460
Or somebody else faked Harry's death.

405
00:26:03,495 --> 00:26:07,297
Or Harry faked somebody else's death.

406
00:26:07,332 --> 00:26:09,600
That last one doesn't work at all.

407
00:26:09,635 --> 00:26:11,602
- No, it doesn't.    - The first two are contenders.

408
00:26:11,637 --> 00:26:13,203
No, I'm gonna go. We're done here.

409
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:14,671
- No, we are not done here.    - This is…

410
00:26:14,706 --> 00:26:16,840
Wait. Wait. Wait a minute. Where're you going?

411
00:26:16,875 --> 00:26:18,942
Hold up a sec. We're gonna need each other.

412
00:26:18,977 --> 00:26:22,179
No, we don't. I don't need a Pokemon. Period. Got it?

413
00:26:22,214 --> 00:26:23,747
Then what about a world-class detective?

414
00:26:23,782 --> 00:26:26,783
Because if you wanna find your pops, I'm your best bet.

415
00:26:26,818 --> 00:26:28,118
I think a world-class detective

416
00:26:28,153 --> 00:26:29,486
oughta have figured out by now

417
00:26:29,521 --> 00:26:31,755
that I'm not here to find my father.

418
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:33,457
I'm here to say goodbye.

419
00:26:33,492 --> 00:26:36,093
Hey, hey. There's no one to say goodbye to.

420
00:26:36,128 --> 00:26:38,862
Look, you can talk to humans. I can talk to Pokemon.

421
00:26:38,897 --> 00:26:40,530
We can talk to each other.

422
00:26:40,565 --> 00:26:43,700
This doesn't happen, kid. It has to mean something.

423
00:26:43,735 --> 00:26:46,103
There's magic that brought us together,

424
00:26:46,138 --> 00:26:49,273
and that magic is called hope.

425
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:53,877
Hope that Harry is still alive.

426
00:26:58,050 --> 00:27:02,152
Oh, you feel it. You feel it in your jellies, don't you?

427
00:27:02,187 --> 00:27:03,687
There's nothing in my jellies.

428
00:27:03,722 --> 00:27:06,824
We're gonna do this. You and me.

429
00:27:09,394 --> 00:27:11,828
I can't belie…

430
00:27:11,863 --> 00:27:14,064
I will meet you here tomorrow morning.

431
00:27:14,099 --> 00:27:15,766
Great.

432
00:27:15,801 --> 00:27:17,701
- Where're you going?    - To my apartment.

433
00:27:17,736 --> 00:27:19,002
What do you mean, "Your apartment"?

434
00:27:19,037 --> 00:27:20,270
What?

435
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:21,605
All right, you can sleep on the couch.

436
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,273
No, I'm not gonna sleep on the couch.

437
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:24,875
Well, then you can sleep on the stove.

438
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:26,810
Be a dear, would you, and get the door for me.

439
00:27:26,845 --> 00:27:27,878
What am I doing?

440
00:27:27,913 --> 00:27:28,979
I just invited

441
00:27:29,014 --> 00:27:30,447
someone to my apartment.

442
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:33,250
I never do this. I'm not that kind of Pokemon.

443
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:38,855
Dust everywhere.

444
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:40,457
No fingerprints.

445
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:43,326
Ugh. Doesn't add up.

446
00:27:43,361 --> 00:27:44,761
What is going on in here?

447
00:27:44,796 --> 00:27:46,663
I'm searching the joint, looking for clues.

448
00:27:46,698 --> 00:27:48,298
- Is this your room?    - No.

449
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:50,000
Does Harry have other children?

450
00:27:50,035 --> 00:27:51,668
No.

451
00:27:51,703 --> 00:27:53,503
He wanted me to live here when I was a kid,

452
00:27:53,538 --> 00:27:55,706
so he made it look like my childhood room.

453
00:27:55,741 --> 00:27:57,274
Should we talk about the fact

454
00:27:57,309 --> 00:27:59,276
that your childhood bed is a Pikachu bed?

455
00:27:59,311 --> 00:28:00,343
It's a coincidence.

456
00:28:00,378 --> 00:28:01,945
I'm sorry. Can you speak up?

457
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:03,380
I can't hear you.

458
00:28:03,415 --> 00:28:04,614
I've never been so flattered

459
00:28:04,649 --> 00:28:06,249
and creeped out at the same time.

460
00:28:06,284 --> 00:28:08,018
Are you gonna make me into a lampshade?

461
00:28:08,053 --> 00:28:09,119
Oh, I might.

462
00:28:09,154 --> 00:28:10,587
Hang on, hang on, hang on.

463
00:28:10,622 --> 00:28:12,622
All these Pokemon cards and the battle posters…

464
00:28:12,657 --> 00:28:15,058
There's a connection, isn't there?

465
00:28:15,093 --> 00:28:17,627
- You love Pokemon.    - No.

466
00:28:17,662 --> 00:28:19,062
Yeah. Yeah, you do.

467
00:28:19,097 --> 00:28:20,464
That was a long time ago,

468
00:28:20,499 --> 00:28:21,932
before my father moved to the city

469
00:28:21,967 --> 00:28:24,134
and spent more time with Pokemon than his own son.

470
00:28:24,169 --> 00:28:26,036
Mmm, yeah, blame it on your dad.

471
00:28:26,071 --> 00:28:27,537
Okay, look, what about this?

472
00:28:27,572 --> 00:28:29,372
There's pictures of her all over the apartment.

473
00:28:29,407 --> 00:28:30,607
She's obviously connected to Harry.

474
00:28:30,642 --> 00:28:32,409
She might know me.

475
00:28:32,444 --> 00:28:33,977
She could be a lead.

476
00:28:34,012 --> 00:28:35,713
No, she's not.

477
00:28:36,815 --> 00:28:38,348
That's my mom.

478
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:40,317
She passed away when I was 11.

479
00:28:40,352 --> 00:28:43,386
Oh. I'm sorry. I…

480
00:28:43,421 --> 00:28:45,022
I didn't realize.

481
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,527
Tomorrow morning I'm gonna take you to Yoshida

482
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:52,596
so we can get some answers.

483
00:29:21,526 --> 00:29:23,260
Ahh, my clues!

484
00:29:23,295 --> 00:29:24,561
What is all this?

485
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:26,029
Hard work. That's what this is.

486
00:29:26,064 --> 00:29:27,898
And, by the way, we can't go to the cops.

487
00:29:27,933 --> 00:29:29,766
Not till we know who we can trust.

488
00:29:29,801 --> 00:29:31,735
So put my clues back in order, would you?

489
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,503
These aren't clues. This is the work of a serial killer.

490
00:29:33,538 --> 00:29:34,604
They're almost clues.

491
00:29:34,639 --> 00:29:35,906
What does that even mean?

492
00:29:35,941 --> 00:29:37,574
Trying to jog my memory, retrace my steps.

493
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:39,476
It helps me to see it all laid out.

494
00:29:39,511 --> 00:29:41,077
That's how I found this.

495
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:44,181
This is what a Frenchman would call<i>caliente fiesta.</i>

496
00:29:44,216 --> 00:29:45,282
Not French.

497
00:29:45,317 --> 00:29:46,483
Smell my finger.

498
00:29:46,518 --> 00:29:48,418
I will never smell your finger.

499
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:49,719
Coward.

500
00:29:49,754 --> 00:29:51,221
The point is, I smelled this R stuff

501
00:29:51,256 --> 00:29:53,356
on those Aipom when they attacked us yesterday.

502
00:29:53,391 --> 00:29:54,691
- R?    - Bingo!

503
00:29:54,726 --> 00:29:56,493
<i>La Cucaracha.</i>

504
00:29:57,262 --> 00:30:00,530
See, I'm thinking Harry

505
00:30:00,565 --> 00:30:02,199
caught a break in the case,

506
00:30:02,234 --> 00:30:03,800
forcing our shadowy kingpin

507
00:30:03,835 --> 00:30:06,903
to send out hired goons to deliver the big hush-hush.

508
00:30:06,938 --> 00:30:08,538
We need to retrace Harry's steps.

509
00:30:08,573 --> 00:30:09,940
Either solve the case ourselves

510
00:30:09,975 --> 00:30:11,575
or get far enough along that this

511
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:13,844
A-number-one bad guy has to reveal himself.

512
00:30:13,879 --> 00:30:15,846
- Or herself!    - Can you stop doing that?

513
00:30:15,881 --> 00:30:18,381
So, what is the way in, huh?

514
00:30:18,416 --> 00:30:19,883
The answer is in this room.

515
00:30:19,918 --> 00:30:21,918
This isn't a room. This is a fire hazard.

516
00:30:21,953 --> 00:30:25,189
It's just junk and papers and…

517
00:30:27,425 --> 00:30:29,059
Newspapers.

518
00:30:29,094 --> 00:30:30,527
What you got, kid?

519
00:30:30,562 --> 00:30:32,195
I literally just met someone.

520
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:34,798
She was a… She was a junior reporter at CNM.

521
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:37,400
She was doing a story on Harry.

522
00:30:37,435 --> 00:30:39,336
I think she knows more than she let on.

523
00:30:39,371 --> 00:30:41,171
The smart ones always do.

524
00:30:41,206 --> 00:30:43,273
We gotta go down to her work and press her.

525
00:30:43,308 --> 00:30:44,507
- Okay.    - That's a metaphor.

526
00:30:44,542 --> 00:30:46,109
Yeah, I know what a metaphor is.

527
00:30:46,144 --> 00:30:47,677
Uh, I was drinking that.

528
00:30:47,712 --> 00:30:49,112
I was also drink… Just step anywhere.

529
00:30:49,147 --> 00:30:50,480
It's only my life's work.

530
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:53,016
No. No, we're not doing that.

531
00:30:53,051 --> 00:30:54,251
Fine, I'll walk.

532
00:30:54,286 --> 00:30:57,154
I'm trying to get in 100,000 steps this hour.

533
00:30:59,257 --> 00:31:02,025
<i>Hello, I'm Roger Clifford, president of CNM</i>

534
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:03,793
and chairman of Clifford Enterprises.

535
00:31:03,828 --> 00:31:05,462
And I'm Howard Clifford,

536
00:31:05,497 --> 00:31:07,664
the visionary icon behind Ryme City.

537
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:09,766
Together, in the spirit of harmony,

538
00:31:09,801 --> 00:31:11,534
we're throwing the largest parade

539
00:31:11,569 --> 00:31:13,403
that Ryme City has ever seen.

540
00:31:13,438 --> 00:31:14,971
You won't wanna miss it.

541
00:31:15,006 --> 00:31:17,007
So, at the weekend, we invite the people…

542
00:31:17,042 --> 00:31:18,842
And the Pokemon to be there.

543
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:20,510
A celebration of the harmony

544
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:23,713
between humans and Pokemon.

545
00:31:23,748 --> 00:31:25,949
And, cut!

546
00:31:25,984 --> 00:31:27,450
Well, I think that went rather well.

547
00:31:27,485 --> 00:31:28,685
Oh, shut up, Dad!

548
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,053
He seems nice.

549
00:31:30,088 --> 00:31:31,855
Roger, please. This is supposed to be

550
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:33,723
our gift to the citizens.

551
00:31:33,758 --> 00:31:35,859
"Visionary icon"? Really?

552
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:38,061
Was "savior of the world" taken?

553
00:31:38,096 --> 00:31:40,597
It was your people who wrote the promo, son.

554
00:31:40,632 --> 00:31:42,432
Oh, is there an unabridged version

555
00:31:42,467 --> 00:31:44,534
where you cure cancer?

556
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:45,902
Oh, that's right, yeah.

557
00:31:45,937 --> 00:31:47,637
Turn your back on me like you always did.

558
00:31:47,672 --> 00:31:48,905
Ditto!

559
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:50,640
By the way, no one likes your Pokemon!

560
00:31:50,675 --> 00:31:51,708
There she is.

561
00:31:53,345 --> 00:31:55,011
I can see why you were so excited.

562
00:31:55,046 --> 00:31:57,681
I was… Okay, I was not that excited.

563
00:31:57,716 --> 00:31:59,082
Mr. Clifford! Mr. Clifford!

564
00:31:59,117 --> 00:32:01,885
Mr. Clifford, I may have a story for you.

565
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,254
I've heard rumors of Pokemon attacking people.

566
00:32:04,289 --> 00:32:05,922
But there's been no mainstream coverage.

567
00:32:05,957 --> 00:32:07,824
I'm sorry, we're not a tabloid.

568
00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:09,693
Which means that we don't report

569
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:12,829
on rumors, gossip or hearsay.

570
00:32:12,864 --> 00:32:15,732
It's not news if it can't be verified.

571
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:19,602
You want a story, find a source.

572
00:32:19,637 --> 00:32:21,772
Oh, and pro tip:

573
00:32:22,741 --> 00:32:25,242
A reasonable sense of fashion.

574
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:37,854
Here she comes.

575
00:32:37,889 --> 00:32:39,222
Here she comes. Try to look deep.

576
00:32:39,257 --> 00:32:40,790
What are you doing here?

577
00:32:40,825 --> 00:32:42,359
Hey, again. Uh…

578
00:32:42,394 --> 00:32:43,793
Yeah, I know this seems weird

579
00:32:43,828 --> 00:32:45,795
but I actually needed to ask you something.

580
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:47,797
Now's not really a good time.

581
00:32:47,832 --> 00:32:51,568
Yeah, I saw that. I'm sorry.

582
00:32:56,007 --> 00:32:58,575
Sorry. It's piping hot.

583
00:32:58,610 --> 00:33:01,211
You found yourself a Pokemon partner.

584
00:33:01,246 --> 00:33:03,013
- Not exactly, no.    - Aw.

585
00:33:03,048 --> 00:33:04,414
He's cute.

586
00:33:04,449 --> 00:33:06,349
She's trying to work me, kid. But, trust me, I can…

587
00:33:06,384 --> 00:33:09,452
Oh, sweet Mother of Arceus, that feels so good.

588
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:11,621
- So, listen…    - Oh, my God.

589
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:12,922
What happened?

590
00:33:12,957 --> 00:33:14,758
I found something in Harry's desk,

591
00:33:14,793 --> 00:33:16,760
nearly choked me to death, and I was--

592
00:33:16,795 --> 00:33:17,995
No, not here.

593
00:33:19,798 --> 00:33:22,365
In my office.

594
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:25,235
In her office? We're going to her office?

595
00:33:27,472 --> 00:33:29,005
This is great.

596
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:32,275
This isn't an office. It's a coffin with pencils.

597
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:33,676
Psyduck?

598
00:33:33,711 --> 00:33:34,911
Yeah, that's right. I can talk to the kid,

599
00:33:34,946 --> 00:33:36,246
he can talk to me. We're gifted.

600
00:33:36,281 --> 00:33:38,214
You didn't tell me that she has a Psyduck.

601
00:33:38,249 --> 00:33:40,750
These things explode when they're stressed.

602
00:33:40,785 --> 00:33:42,452
Hey. Hey, keep calm, pal.

603
00:33:42,487 --> 00:33:44,921
Serenity now. Serenity now.

604
00:33:45,557 --> 00:33:47,257
- No.    - Okay.

605
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:49,025
Okay.

606
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:51,028
- You got it?    - Here it is.

607
00:33:54,833 --> 00:33:55,999
Where did you find these?

608
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:57,333
Word on the street was that

609
00:33:57,368 --> 00:33:59,102
Harry had an informant near the docks.

610
00:33:59,137 --> 00:34:00,770
I went there to snoop around,

611
00:34:00,805 --> 00:34:02,939
and that's where I found the vial.

612
00:34:02,974 --> 00:34:05,608
But the docks can be dangerous.

613
00:34:05,643 --> 00:34:06,810
It's not the sort of place

614
00:34:06,845 --> 00:34:09,245
you want to visit alone at night.

615
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,882
I'm actually pretty good at being alone at night.

616
00:34:13,184 --> 00:34:16,319
Nope, that did not land right at all.

617
00:34:16,354 --> 00:34:20,223
That's not… That's not what I meant to say. Um…

618
00:34:20,258 --> 00:34:22,358
- It's okay.    - I'm just gonna…

619
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:23,927
We should go.

620
00:34:23,962 --> 00:34:26,196
- Yeah, we should go.    - I'm just gonna scoot by ya.

621
00:34:26,231 --> 00:34:28,798
Good God, have you ever talked to a woman before?

622
00:34:28,833 --> 00:34:30,767
- You've got some…    - Psyduck.

623
00:34:30,802 --> 00:34:33,002
Yes, I've talked women before. No, I don't need your help.

624
00:34:33,037 --> 00:34:35,305
Was it during the birth canal, or…

625
00:34:40,145 --> 00:34:41,444
You know what you need?

626
00:34:41,479 --> 00:34:43,346
A shoulder saddle. I bet someone makes one.

627
00:34:43,381 --> 00:34:44,948
Okay. There are other ways for you to get around.

628
00:34:44,983 --> 00:34:46,549
This is humiliating.

629
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:48,051
Every step for you is 1000 for me,

630
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:49,219
and my lungs are the size of grapes.

631
00:34:49,254 --> 00:34:50,687
We need to get some ground rules

632
00:34:50,722 --> 00:34:51,721
if this partnership's gonna work.

633
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:53,289
You're not my partner.

634
00:34:53,324 --> 00:34:54,524
Mentor,<i>sensei,</i>master,

635
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:55,525
whatever you wanna call it.

636
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,093
Nope, none of those.

637
00:34:57,128 --> 00:34:58,661
Hey, what if it wasn't the gas? What if it's hereditary?

638
00:34:58,696 --> 00:35:01,231
What if Harry could understand your annoying voice, too?

639
00:35:01,266 --> 00:35:03,600
You don't need to talk to us for us to understand.

640
00:35:03,635 --> 00:35:05,368
We can feel what you're saying.

641
00:35:05,403 --> 00:35:08,404
You have to be open to the experience. Try it sometime.

642
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:09,739
Yeah, I'd rather not.

643
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:11,040
I got my plate full talking to you.

644
00:35:12,377 --> 00:35:13,576
What is that?

645
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:14,978
Silent but deadly.

646
00:35:15,013 --> 00:35:16,646
Apologies, my tummy's bad from all the coffee.

647
00:35:16,681 --> 00:35:18,215
No. Ew. Get off.

648
00:35:18,983 --> 00:35:20,750
I meant that.

649
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:22,619
Oh. Ooh. Ugh.

650
00:35:22,654 --> 00:35:23,887
That.

651
00:35:23,922 --> 00:35:26,689
It's a Mr. Mime. They're the worst.

652
00:35:26,724 --> 00:35:29,559
Silent but annoying.

653
00:35:29,594 --> 00:35:32,295
Does he recognize you? I think he recognizes you.

654
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:35,165
Well, I was Harry's partner, so I would've been with him.

655
00:35:36,267 --> 00:35:38,535
Harry's informant is a Pokemon!

656
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:39,769
Get him!

657
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:47,911
- He's barely moving.    - Don't tell him that.

658
00:35:47,946 --> 00:35:49,212
Oh! He's on a bike.

659
00:35:49,247 --> 00:35:50,647
Come on! He thinks he's getting away.

660
00:35:50,682 --> 00:35:51,981
Look, quick! Get in front of him.

661
00:35:52,016 --> 00:35:53,950
- Cut him off. You can make it.    - Stop.

662
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:56,686
Oh, no.

663
00:35:56,721 --> 00:35:58,855
He's going down hard, Tim.

664
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:00,890
Should've worn a helmet.

665
00:36:00,925 --> 00:36:02,091
I hope he makes it.

666
00:36:02,126 --> 00:36:04,527
Come on. This is ridiculous.

667
00:36:04,562 --> 00:36:05,895
I'm good cop, you're bad cop.

668
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:07,163
We're not cops.

669
00:36:07,198 --> 00:36:08,464
Grow some berries.

670
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:09,766
You're bigger and tougher looking than I am.

671
00:36:09,801 --> 00:36:11,334
Stand up straight!

672
00:36:11,369 --> 00:36:12,468
Listen up.

673
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:14,270
We got ways to make you talk. Or mime.

674
00:36:14,305 --> 00:36:15,605
Yeah.

675
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:16,806
So tell us what we wanna know.

676
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:18,141
Why was Harry Goodman here

677
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:20,010
and what did it have to do with the R?

678
00:36:21,446 --> 00:36:23,446
Pipe. Yes, okay. A can!

679
00:36:23,481 --> 00:36:24,981
Shoving. Pushing.

680
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:26,182
My problem is that I push people away

681
00:36:26,217 --> 00:36:27,750
and then hate them for leaving.

682
00:36:27,785 --> 00:36:29,986
- He's saying you can shove it.    - What? I can shove it?

683
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:31,588
Okay, that's it. We're switching roles.

684
00:36:31,623 --> 00:36:32,889
I'm bad cop, you're good cop.

685
00:36:32,924 --> 00:36:34,324
- No, no, no, we're not cops!    - Oh!

686
00:36:34,359 --> 00:36:36,059
Oh, God, that's a very hard wall.

687
00:36:36,094 --> 00:36:37,727
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, Mr. Mime has the ability

688
00:36:37,762 --> 00:36:39,696
to make invisible walls.

689
00:36:39,731 --> 00:36:42,365
Uh, yes, I know. I happen to be a Pokemon, too, remember?

690
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:46,202
Look, Harry figured this guy out somehow.

691
00:36:46,237 --> 00:36:49,072
I think the trick is getting inside his head.

692
00:36:50,341 --> 00:36:51,441
I have an idea.

693
00:36:53,177 --> 00:36:54,644
What are you doing?

694
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,113
Oh, what's this?

695
00:36:57,148 --> 00:36:58,648
Oh, there's a door there. I didn't…

696
00:36:58,683 --> 00:37:00,016
Probably because it's invisible.

697
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:02,785
Huh? Yeah! I'm in your space now, am I right?

698
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:04,887
You don't like this so much, do you?

699
00:37:04,922 --> 00:37:07,023
What are you doing?

700
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:09,225
That's a jug. No, you're pouring.

701
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:10,360
No.

702
00:37:10,395 --> 00:37:11,928
Salt. It's a salt shaker. You're cooking.

703
00:37:11,963 --> 00:37:13,229
- No.    - Real cooking is about

704
00:37:13,264 --> 00:37:14,264
following your heart, not a recipe!

705
00:37:14,299 --> 00:37:15,665
What are you talking about?

706
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:18,067
Gas. You're pouring gasoline on…

707
00:37:18,102 --> 00:37:20,903
- Mmm-hmm.    - Oh, that went dark fast.

708
00:37:20,938 --> 00:37:23,106
I like this. I like this very much.

709
00:37:25,009 --> 00:37:26,309
All right, all right.

710
00:37:28,179 --> 00:37:29,912
Okay. You wanna play that game?

711
00:37:29,947 --> 00:37:31,648
I can play that game.

712
00:37:33,951 --> 00:37:35,852
You think that's funny?

713
00:37:35,887 --> 00:37:37,487
You think that's funny, huh?

714
00:37:37,522 --> 00:37:40,723
You're not gonna be laughing soon, huh?

715
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:43,159
Who's laughing now, huh?

716
00:37:43,194 --> 00:37:46,095
Oh. Oh, I smell what you're stepping in.

717
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:47,430
That's right, Mr. Mime.

718
00:37:47,465 --> 00:37:49,766
You're about to be Mr. Melt

719
00:37:49,801 --> 00:37:51,334
unless you start talking.

720
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:54,904
Cards, cards. Playing cards. Poker.

721
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:56,472
No, I think he's talking about the R.

722
00:37:56,507 --> 00:37:58,241
Someone was handing out R.

723
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:00,176
Use your body words. Where?

724
00:38:00,211 --> 00:38:02,278
Circle house. Moon house. Moon. House.

725
00:38:02,313 --> 00:38:04,380
Enough with the games. Say it.

726
00:38:04,415 --> 00:38:05,515
Just say it!

727
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:07,050
Talk, you stupid mime!

728
00:38:07,085 --> 00:38:09,119
Okay, just relax.

729
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:11,020
Uh, round.

730
00:38:11,055 --> 00:38:12,422
Round house. Uh…

731
00:38:12,457 --> 00:38:14,390
The source of the R came from the Roundhouse.

732
00:38:14,425 --> 00:38:15,858
Yeah, nice work, kid. Maybe there's

733
00:38:15,893 --> 00:38:17,794
a little detective in you after all.

734
00:38:34,345 --> 00:38:39,049
Critical hit! Additional damage!

735
00:38:50,862 --> 00:38:53,629
I didn't know they had Pokemon battles in Ryme City.

736
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:54,698
We're not supposed to.

737
00:38:57,101 --> 00:38:59,669
Gengar uses Shadow Ball!

738
00:39:10,615 --> 00:39:12,449
Come on. Let's take a look around.

739
00:39:17,989 --> 00:39:20,056
Okay, kid. So here's what we know.

740
00:39:20,091 --> 00:39:22,125
Harry traces the R to here.

741
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,359
Then frequents this joint because someone

742
00:39:23,394 --> 00:39:24,894
here knows something about something.

743
00:39:24,929 --> 00:39:27,897
We just need to find the someone and the something.

744
00:39:27,932 --> 00:39:32,468
Hey, hey! Where's that Pikachu's partner? Don't go.

745
00:39:32,503 --> 00:39:34,537
I think the "someone" just found us.

746
00:39:34,572 --> 00:39:36,105
Wow. I'd like to see

747
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:37,507
this guy's Internet search history.

748
00:39:37,542 --> 00:39:38,741
Who are you?

749
00:39:38,776 --> 00:39:39,876
Let's see where this goes.

750
00:39:39,911 --> 00:39:41,110
Tell him you're my new partner.

751
00:39:41,145 --> 00:39:43,112
I'm his new partner.

752
00:39:43,147 --> 00:39:45,114
Well, that Pikachu's Thunderbolt

753
00:39:45,149 --> 00:39:47,283
almost wrecked my prize Charizard

754
00:39:47,318 --> 00:39:49,552
- last time he was here.    - Oh.

755
00:39:50,588 --> 00:39:51,921
Scar is still fresh.

756
00:39:51,956 --> 00:39:55,792
All I hear are consonants, and all I see are nipples.

757
00:39:55,827 --> 00:39:57,660
And you know what?

758
00:39:57,695 --> 00:40:00,129
He ruined my coat, man. Look at this.

759
00:40:00,164 --> 00:40:01,330
I'm so sorry.

760
00:40:01,365 --> 00:40:03,099
Forget the coat. Where's his shirt?

761
00:40:03,134 --> 00:40:06,002
This! This is my place!

762
00:40:06,037 --> 00:40:08,471
And nobody comes into my place

763
00:40:08,506 --> 00:40:10,773
and does that to my Pokemon.

764
00:40:10,808 --> 00:40:11,974
What are you looking at?

765
00:40:12,009 --> 00:40:13,810
Or to my coat.

766
00:40:13,845 --> 00:40:15,711
Right, the coat. The coat.

767
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:17,180
What are you doing?

768
00:40:17,215 --> 00:40:19,015
Classic staredown, kid. First one to blink loses.

769
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:20,149
Now stop distracting me.

770
00:40:20,184 --> 00:40:22,318
Er, look, I just wanna know

771
00:40:22,353 --> 00:40:24,153
why his old partner was here. That's all.

772
00:40:24,188 --> 00:40:25,755
Gengar wins.

773
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:29,792
Ready for next battle.

774
00:40:29,827 --> 00:40:31,527
And I want a rematch.

775
00:40:31,562 --> 00:40:33,796
You give me my rematch…

776
00:40:35,366 --> 00:40:37,667
I'll tell you everything you want to know. What I know.

777
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:41,438
- Er…    - Tell him he's on,<i>amigo.</i>

778
00:40:42,173 --> 00:40:43,206
Okay.

779
00:40:43,241 --> 00:40:45,341
A new battle's unfolding.

780
00:40:45,376 --> 00:40:48,644
Pikachu versus Charizard.

781
00:40:48,679 --> 00:40:49,912
Rematch!

782
00:40:53,684 --> 00:40:55,785
Here. Hold my hat.

783
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:57,253
I'm about to rock this place.

784
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:59,288
- Okay.    - Charizard! Charizard!

785
00:40:59,323 --> 00:41:00,823
Just doing some light stretching.

786
00:41:00,858 --> 00:41:02,492
You never wanna go into these things tight.

787
00:41:02,527 --> 00:41:04,627
You're gonna win this time, okay?

788
00:41:04,662 --> 00:41:07,163
What are you doing? What is your plan of attack?

789
00:41:07,198 --> 00:41:08,998
I don't operate according to plans, kid.

790
00:41:09,033 --> 00:41:11,200
I deal with things in the moment.

791
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:16,806
Here. Here we go. Now you'll be ready.

792
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:23,279
Now, obviously, I've dealt with this putz before,

793
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:24,780
so I'll just do it again.

794
00:41:26,083 --> 00:41:27,383
Give me my hat back!

795
00:41:27,418 --> 00:41:28,584
That thing just chugged

796
00:41:28,619 --> 00:41:30,453
a year's worth of that R stuff!

797
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:32,889
Hey, hey, hey. It's like you said, okay?

798
00:41:32,924 --> 00:41:34,023
You did it before.

799
00:41:34,058 --> 00:41:35,558
You just gotta use your powers.

800
00:41:35,593 --> 00:41:38,327
You can use Quick Attack, Discharge, or Electro Ball,

801
00:41:38,362 --> 00:41:39,795
but I think Volt Tackle

802
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:41,297
is your best move, so start with that.

803
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:42,765
First of all,

804
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,367
when did you learn how to be a Pokemon Trainer?

805
00:41:44,402 --> 00:41:46,435
And secondly, get me the hell out of here!

806
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:47,470
Begin!

807
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,274
- Look out!    - Whoa, whoa, whoa!

808
00:41:51,309 --> 00:41:52,775
I forgot everything you said!

809
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:54,844
I forget things, it's what I do! I have amnesia!

810
00:41:54,879 --> 00:41:57,046
You need to go for a critical hit. Use Volt Tackle!

811
00:41:57,081 --> 00:42:00,116
Volt Tackle will knock me out. I'm going for Thunderbolt.

812
00:42:01,385 --> 00:42:03,719
Come on. You got it, you got it!

813
00:42:12,430 --> 00:42:14,230
Come on, come on, come on.

814
00:42:14,265 --> 00:42:16,165
Hey, bud! What are you doing?

815
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,234
I can't do it when people are watching.

816
00:42:18,269 --> 00:42:20,303
Can everyone just look away, please?

817
00:42:20,338 --> 00:42:22,438
It's not working.

818
00:42:22,473 --> 00:42:24,173
I forgot how to use my powers.

819
00:42:26,944 --> 00:42:28,144
But he didn't!

820
00:42:32,850 --> 00:42:33,983
Pikachu, run!

821
00:42:34,018 --> 00:42:35,585
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

822
00:42:42,793 --> 00:42:44,794
Taken out with one hit!

823
00:42:44,829 --> 00:42:46,762
Aw, Pikachu. Wanna cry?

824
00:42:51,168 --> 00:42:54,036
You don't wanna do this! I'm adorable.

825
00:42:54,071 --> 00:42:55,638
Pika-Pika?

826
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:07,684
Are you crazy? Get out of there!

827
00:43:09,987 --> 00:43:11,087
I got it, kid!

828
00:43:21,499 --> 00:43:23,633
What are you doing to my baby?

829
00:43:23,668 --> 00:43:25,801
- Get out of the way!    - Uh-oh.

830
00:43:33,477 --> 00:43:36,078
Uh-oh. That's not good.

831
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:12,481
Tell me what you know!

832
00:44:12,516 --> 00:44:14,316
The guy you are looking for

833
00:44:14,351 --> 00:44:17,086
wanted to know the source of R.

834
00:44:17,121 --> 00:44:18,888
It comes from the doctor.

835
00:44:18,923 --> 00:44:19,955
That's all I know.

836
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:21,024
Now let me go!

837
00:44:35,639 --> 00:44:37,473
Nice catch, kid. Let's get out of here.

838
00:44:42,313 --> 00:44:43,813
I got a plan.

839
00:44:43,848 --> 00:44:45,781
What? That's not gonna work. Magikarp is the worst.

840
00:44:45,816 --> 00:44:47,683
Magikarp can evolve into Gyarados.

841
00:44:47,718 --> 00:44:49,018
All it needs is a little kick.

842
00:44:49,053 --> 00:44:50,319
Water in the hole!

843
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:55,458
In my head, I saw that differently.

844
00:44:55,493 --> 00:44:57,894
Er…

845
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:13,876
Hey, Tim? I don't float.

846
00:45:21,352 --> 00:45:24,387
Ha! I told you Magikarp weren't useless.

847
00:45:26,056 --> 00:45:27,857
You're under arrest.

848
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:32,061
I thought you couldn't wait to get home.

849
00:45:32,096 --> 00:45:35,398
Yeah. Well, my plans changed because I found him.

850
00:45:36,066 --> 00:45:37,466
I'm not following.

851
00:45:37,501 --> 00:45:39,835
Harry's not dead. If his Pokemon partner

852
00:45:39,870 --> 00:45:41,203
is still alive, that means he is, too.

853
00:45:41,238 --> 00:45:42,671
That is not proof, son.

854
00:45:42,706 --> 00:45:44,006
Tell him about the chemical R.

855
00:45:44,041 --> 00:45:45,074
Give me a minute.

856
00:45:45,109 --> 00:45:46,442
Harry's last case

857
00:45:46,477 --> 00:45:47,877
had to do with those underground battles.

858
00:45:47,912 --> 00:45:49,078
That's why I was there. There's a chemical.

859
00:45:49,113 --> 00:45:50,446
We ran an investigation.

860
00:45:50,481 --> 00:45:51,781
Harry figured it out and he's in trouble.

861
00:45:51,816 --> 00:45:52,982
That case is closed. Over!

862
00:45:53,017 --> 00:45:54,250
You gotta reopen the investigation!

863
00:45:54,285 --> 00:45:55,584
He's out there, I can feel it.

864
00:45:55,619 --> 00:45:56,652
In your jellies. Go ahead, say it.

865
00:45:56,687 --> 00:45:57,987
I'm not gonna say that.

866
00:45:58,022 --> 00:46:00,322
I can feel it, Lieutenant, in my bones.

867
00:46:00,357 --> 00:46:02,391
- Not as good.    - Stop!

868
00:46:02,426 --> 00:46:04,960
Oh, yeah, and I can understand Pikachu,

869
00:46:04,995 --> 00:46:06,896
like, word perfect, so…

870
00:46:08,699 --> 00:46:10,366
Tim.

871
00:46:10,401 --> 00:46:12,701
It's very difficult coping with loss.

872
00:46:12,736 --> 00:46:14,136
Denial can be a powerful thing.

873
00:46:14,171 --> 00:46:16,772
No, I'm not in denial! I'm right, I know it!

874
00:46:16,807 --> 00:46:19,041
He's… He's out there.

875
00:46:24,949 --> 00:46:27,383
I never wanted to show you this,

876
00:46:27,418 --> 00:46:29,986
but I think it's important you see it.

877
00:46:37,728 --> 00:46:41,096
No one could survive a crash like that.

878
00:46:41,131 --> 00:46:42,865
Not even your dad.

879
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:48,104
He's gone, Tim.

880
00:46:59,116 --> 00:47:01,551
I should've gotten on that train.

881
00:47:04,388 --> 00:47:05,922
What's that, kid?

882
00:47:08,692 --> 00:47:10,726
After my mom died,

883
00:47:11,729 --> 00:47:13,863
my dad and I drifted apart.

884
00:47:13,898 --> 00:47:15,064
Er…

885
00:47:15,099 --> 00:47:18,968
He moved here and poured himself into his work.

886
00:47:20,938 --> 00:47:22,571
And, eventually, he tried to get me

887
00:47:22,606 --> 00:47:24,473
to come live with him,

888
00:47:25,276 --> 00:47:26,709
but I wouldn't go.

889
00:47:28,245 --> 00:47:29,679
How come?

890
00:47:34,251 --> 00:47:36,018
I didn't think he cared.

891
00:47:38,622 --> 00:47:44,627
I guess I just got used to him not being around

892
00:47:44,662 --> 00:47:47,797
and I couldn't forgive him for it.

893
00:47:49,366 --> 00:47:51,100
Until I got here.

894
00:47:54,838 --> 00:47:57,039
And I realized that he did care.

895
00:47:59,376 --> 00:48:02,378
But I didn't know…

896
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:06,616
because I never gave him the chance.

897
00:48:07,618 --> 00:48:10,820
And now it's too late.

898
00:48:14,858 --> 00:48:16,859
I really…

899
00:48:19,096 --> 00:48:21,931
I really wish I'd gotten on that train.

900
00:48:24,335 --> 00:48:25,768
Mmm-hmm.

901
00:48:29,039 --> 00:48:30,506
Listen, kid.

902
00:48:31,308 --> 00:48:32,708
Um…

903
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:35,577
Look, I may not have memories,

904
00:48:35,612 --> 00:48:38,114
um, but I know this much:

905
00:48:39,850 --> 00:48:41,550
It wasn't your fault.

906
00:48:44,321 --> 00:48:46,289
It wasn't anybody's fault.

907
00:48:48,792 --> 00:48:51,594
And I'm sure that if your dad was here,

908
00:48:53,330 --> 00:48:55,497
he would hug you so hard,

909
00:48:55,532 --> 00:48:57,266
your bones would pop.

910
00:48:58,268 --> 00:48:59,301
And he'd tell you

911
00:48:59,336 --> 00:49:01,137
he's sorry for everything.

912
00:49:03,741 --> 00:49:06,208
He'd be damn proud of you, kid.

913
00:49:10,214 --> 00:49:12,514
I haven't been really nice to you.

914
00:49:12,549 --> 00:49:14,650
No, you really haven't.

915
00:49:18,555 --> 00:49:19,822
Well…

916
00:49:20,991 --> 00:49:23,025
We still got one mystery to solve.

917
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:24,326
What?

918
00:49:24,361 --> 00:49:25,661
Yours.

919
00:49:26,997 --> 00:49:29,798
Let's find out who did this to you.

920
00:49:29,833 --> 00:49:31,333
Get your memory back.

921
00:49:31,368 --> 00:49:32,868
I'd like that.

922
00:49:33,837 --> 00:49:35,571
I'd like that very much.

923
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:41,243
Well, that's a bad-guy car.

924
00:50:00,097 --> 00:50:01,697
Thank you, Miss Norman.

925
00:50:01,732 --> 00:50:04,700
Yes. Thank you, Miss Norman. That'll be all.

926
00:50:04,735 --> 00:50:06,235
What a blabbermouth.

927
00:50:06,937 --> 00:50:09,271
Please, come in.

928
00:50:13,911 --> 00:50:16,211
Magnificent creatures, aren't they?

929
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:25,921
Whoa. A Flareon.

930
00:50:27,558 --> 00:50:30,292
Imagine being able to evolve

931
00:50:30,327 --> 00:50:33,128
into the best possible version of yourself.

932
00:50:33,163 --> 00:50:35,364
Hmm. 'Sup?

933
00:50:35,399 --> 00:50:40,069
That greatness inside you, just waiting to be awoken.

934
00:50:43,574 --> 00:50:44,673
Hello, Tim.

935
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:46,141
He knows you?

936
00:50:46,176 --> 00:50:48,877
I see you've partnered with Harry's Pikachu.

937
00:50:48,912 --> 00:50:50,412
And he knows me, too.

938
00:50:50,447 --> 00:50:52,114
You knew Harry?

939
00:50:52,149 --> 00:50:54,717
The case Harry was working on,

940
00:50:55,285 --> 00:50:56,351
it was for me.

941
00:50:56,386 --> 00:50:58,921
That's a twist. That's very twisty.

942
00:50:58,956 --> 00:51:03,058
This compound threatens everything I've built.

943
00:51:03,093 --> 00:51:05,327
He knows about the R. How does he know about the R?

944
00:51:05,362 --> 00:51:08,130
I hired Harry to trace it to its source.

945
00:51:08,165 --> 00:51:11,133
Imagine my shock when the answer

946
00:51:11,168 --> 00:51:13,769
turned out to be my own son.

947
00:51:15,405 --> 00:51:18,540
I've devoted my life to perfecting the partnership

948
00:51:18,575 --> 00:51:20,209
between Pokemon and humans.

949
00:51:20,244 --> 00:51:23,745
A partnership where Pokemon bring out the best in us.

950
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:26,014
In doing so, I'm afraid I neglected

951
00:51:26,049 --> 00:51:28,417
my responsibilities as a parent.

952
00:51:31,155 --> 00:51:33,455
Roger resents the Pokemon.

953
00:51:33,490 --> 00:51:36,825
I think he's lived in my shadow for so long,

954
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:39,928
he actually wants to destroy my legacy.

955
00:51:39,963 --> 00:51:41,130
Well, there's no such thing

956
00:51:41,165 --> 00:51:42,631
as "daddy issues" without "daddy".

957
00:51:42,666 --> 00:51:45,200
But, Mr. Clifford, how could you let him do that?

958
00:51:45,235 --> 00:51:48,103
Ever since my illness put me in this chair,

959
00:51:48,138 --> 00:51:51,306
Roger has taken over more and more of the company.

960
00:51:51,341 --> 00:51:52,608
He controls the board.

961
00:51:52,643 --> 00:51:55,511
He also controls the police and the politicians.

962
00:51:55,546 --> 00:51:57,412
And he owns the press.

963
00:51:57,447 --> 00:52:00,749
Harry is the only one I can trust.

964
00:52:00,784 --> 00:52:03,486
That's why you need to find him.

965
00:52:04,121 --> 00:52:05,821
You haven't heard.

966
00:52:05,856 --> 00:52:07,556
Harry's dead.

967
00:52:07,591 --> 00:52:09,091
Oh, no, Tim.

968
00:52:10,294 --> 00:52:12,060
Your father

969
00:52:12,095 --> 00:52:13,362
is alive.

970
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:18,100
Look out, kid!

971
00:52:22,206 --> 00:52:24,840
Advanced holographic imaging.

972
00:52:24,875 --> 00:52:27,142
Since being confined to this chair,

973
00:52:27,177 --> 00:52:32,281
I've invested in ways of bringing the world to me.

974
00:52:32,316 --> 00:52:34,783
This was recreated from police footage.

975
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:37,619
It allows us to see things that they cannot

976
00:52:37,654 --> 00:52:40,055
or don't want us to see.

977
00:52:41,959 --> 00:52:43,292
He's alive.

978
00:52:43,827 --> 00:52:45,127
Pika.

979
00:52:45,162 --> 00:52:46,995
It's me. I was with Harry in the crash.

980
00:52:47,030 --> 00:52:48,230
He needs my help.

981
00:52:51,268 --> 00:52:53,335
If Harry's alive, why didn't they find him?

982
00:53:01,278 --> 00:53:02,377
What is that?

983
00:53:02,412 --> 00:53:03,645
Mewtwo.

984
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:06,014
A man-made abomination

985
00:53:06,049 --> 00:53:08,350
created in a laboratory using DNA

986
00:53:08,385 --> 00:53:11,553
from the fossil remains of the Ancient Mew.

987
00:53:11,588 --> 00:53:12,988
I can't believe it.

988
00:53:13,023 --> 00:53:15,090
If that thing came from Mew,

989
00:53:15,125 --> 00:53:16,391
then we're looking at

990
00:53:16,426 --> 00:53:18,427
the most powerful Pokemon in the world.

991
00:53:24,334 --> 00:53:27,436
That's it. That's what happened to me.

992
00:53:27,471 --> 00:53:30,339
Mewtwo wiped my memory.

993
00:53:30,374 --> 00:53:31,373
But why?

994
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:38,013
Wait, wait, wait!

995
00:53:44,054 --> 00:53:47,556
Wait. Wait, wait. Where did it take him?

996
00:53:47,591 --> 00:53:49,925
That's for you to solve now.

997
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:54,163
Find Mewtwo and you will find your father.

998
00:53:58,201 --> 00:53:59,067
Second chances

999
00:53:59,102 --> 00:54:00,636
are special things, kid.

1000
00:54:00,671 --> 00:54:02,571
There's a lot we can make better if we crack this case.

1001
00:54:02,606 --> 00:54:04,640
One question, though. Where are we going?

1002
00:54:04,675 --> 00:54:06,041
I don't know, I'm just going.

1003
00:54:06,076 --> 00:54:07,776
You gotta tell me where. You're the detective.

1004
00:54:07,811 --> 00:54:11,046
Okay. If Roger Clifford is the key to all of this…

1005
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:13,915
Then we need someone who has access to him.

1006
00:54:13,950 --> 00:54:16,551
And we both know who that is, lover boy.

1007
00:54:16,586 --> 00:54:17,953
Okay, come on, that's…

1008
00:54:17,988 --> 00:54:19,922
Come on. Let's not start that again.

1009
00:54:26,730 --> 00:54:28,130
There she is.

1010
00:54:28,165 --> 00:54:30,866
What's with the sunglasses? Can she see us?

1011
00:54:30,901 --> 00:54:32,467
I don't think she can see us.

1012
00:54:32,502 --> 00:54:35,371
- Hey. Thanks for coming.    - Don't talk to me.

1013
00:54:36,506 --> 00:54:38,240
Okay.

1014
00:54:38,275 --> 00:54:41,076
- What happens now?    - Just act casual.

1015
00:54:41,111 --> 00:54:43,545
But don't look at me.

1016
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:46,148
There's nothing really casual about this.

1017
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:48,017
Look at this.

1018
00:54:49,386 --> 00:54:51,053
- Oh, shit.    - Sorry. That was my fault.

1019
00:54:51,088 --> 00:54:52,721
- Ow!    - Sorry. I'm sorry.

1020
00:54:52,756 --> 00:54:54,056
Oh, this is working out great.

1021
00:54:54,091 --> 00:54:55,223
Why don't you just have her sit over here.

1022
00:54:55,258 --> 00:54:56,525
You wanna just come sit with us?

1023
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:57,626
I should never have encouraged you.

1024
00:54:57,661 --> 00:54:58,860
You have no chance.

1025
00:54:58,895 --> 00:55:00,028
I got access to Roger's computer.

1026
00:55:00,063 --> 00:55:01,296
Oh, wow, how'd you do that?

1027
00:55:01,331 --> 00:55:02,931
Spilled a cappuccino on his lap.

1028
00:55:02,966 --> 00:55:04,132
Eh, that sounds like a waste of coffee.

1029
00:55:04,167 --> 00:55:05,567
I searched through all his records.

1030
00:55:05,602 --> 00:55:07,202
I targeted the property rights in the region

1031
00:55:07,237 --> 00:55:08,737
and I cross-checked that with city records

1032
00:55:08,772 --> 00:55:11,606
for any Clifford-financed businesses until I found it.

1033
00:55:11,641 --> 00:55:14,142
May I present PCL:

1034
00:55:14,177 --> 00:55:16,545
A Pokemon genetic research facility.

1035
00:55:16,580 --> 00:55:17,679
But that's not all.

1036
00:55:17,714 --> 00:55:18,847
She's good.

1037
00:55:18,882 --> 00:55:21,016
Last week, PCL had an "accident"

1038
00:55:21,051 --> 00:55:22,551
and had to shut down their entire facility.

1039
00:55:22,586 --> 00:55:25,620
That's the same night Harry Goodman went missing.

1040
00:55:25,655 --> 00:55:27,189
No one knows what happened.

1041
00:55:27,224 --> 00:55:29,658
Total media blackout.

1042
00:55:29,693 --> 00:55:31,126
What does it all mean?

1043
00:55:31,161 --> 00:55:32,894
I don't know. This is very exciting.

1044
00:55:32,929 --> 00:55:34,229
- Are you excited?    - Yeah.

1045
00:55:34,264 --> 00:55:36,198
I think he just peed a little.

1046
00:55:36,233 --> 00:55:38,367
Oh, nope. That's me. That was me.

1047
00:55:38,402 --> 00:55:41,703
So, um, there's a cover-up?

1048
00:55:41,738 --> 00:55:43,005
Mmm-hmm.

1049
00:55:43,974 --> 00:55:46,141
But, er, what are they covering up?

1050
00:55:47,411 --> 00:55:49,545
What do you say we go find out?

1051
00:56:06,263 --> 00:56:07,596
So let me get this right.

1052
00:56:07,631 --> 00:56:09,731
We're forced to listen to this spa music

1053
00:56:09,766 --> 00:56:12,601
so your head doesn't explode and kill us all.

1054
00:56:12,636 --> 00:56:14,035
Psyduck.

1055
00:56:14,070 --> 00:56:16,505
Your Pikachu is so unusual.

1056
00:56:17,007 --> 00:56:18,573
Psyduck.

1057
00:56:18,608 --> 00:56:20,942
Hey, you put that down. I am not giving you a massage.

1058
00:56:20,977 --> 00:56:22,344
Psyduck.

1059
00:56:22,379 --> 00:56:24,813
I have never known a Pokemon to wear a hat.

1060
00:56:24,848 --> 00:56:26,248
Yeah, he's weird. He's so weird.

1061
00:56:26,283 --> 00:56:27,482
Psyduck.

1062
00:56:27,517 --> 00:56:29,084
Of course I care about my partner's life.

1063
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:30,685
Fine, fine. Hand it over.

1064
00:56:31,788 --> 00:56:33,121
What are you doing?

1065
00:56:33,156 --> 00:56:34,790
What?

1066
00:56:34,825 --> 00:56:36,057
Nothing.

1067
00:56:36,092 --> 00:56:38,660
I was actually wondering who this was.

1068
00:56:40,197 --> 00:56:43,532
It's PCL's chief scientist, Dr. Anne Laurent.

1069
00:56:43,567 --> 00:56:45,467
I bet this is the doctor Shirtless was talking about.

1070
00:56:45,502 --> 00:56:46,902
She lost her university grant

1071
00:56:46,937 --> 00:56:48,303
over experimentation of Pokemon

1072
00:56:48,338 --> 00:56:50,338
because she was trying to control their minds.

1073
00:56:50,373 --> 00:56:51,506
Oh, wow.

1074
00:56:51,541 --> 00:56:53,842
She's essentially a neurologist for Pokemon.

1075
00:56:53,877 --> 00:56:55,177
Maybe she could weigh in

1076
00:56:55,212 --> 00:56:56,378
on the long-term psychological effects

1077
00:56:56,413 --> 00:56:58,447
of being strapped into a baby seat

1078
00:56:58,482 --> 00:57:00,549
- next to a bomb.    - Hmm?

1079
00:57:04,688 --> 00:57:06,188
This is it.

1080
00:57:09,025 --> 00:57:10,392
Look at the signs.

1081
00:57:11,795 --> 00:57:14,062
Must have been a really bad accident.

1082
00:57:14,097 --> 00:57:15,864
That's what they want you to believe.

1083
00:57:15,899 --> 00:57:17,866
Whoever staged this did an excellent job.

1084
00:57:17,901 --> 00:57:20,068
Those signs are the perfect scarecrow for suckers.

1085
00:57:20,103 --> 00:57:21,770
Yeah, well, they're working on me.

1086
00:57:21,805 --> 00:57:24,206
Kid, this dame's looking for danger.

1087
00:57:24,241 --> 00:57:25,474
You want to win her over,

1088
00:57:25,509 --> 00:57:27,008
you gotta lead her straight to it.

1089
00:57:27,043 --> 00:57:29,611
First of all, women don't like to be called "dame".

1090
00:57:29,646 --> 00:57:33,882
Second, women appreciate calm, er, level-headed

1091
00:57:33,917 --> 00:57:36,384
and responsible decision-making.

1092
00:57:36,419 --> 00:57:39,054
What is she doing? Hey, hey!

1093
00:57:39,689 --> 00:57:40,956
Hey!

1094
00:57:40,991 --> 00:57:42,958
Lucy, what are you doing?

1095
00:57:42,993 --> 00:57:46,528
I'm, er, I'm cutting the fence so that we can slip through.

1096
00:57:46,563 --> 00:57:47,996
Where did you get those?

1097
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:49,297
Oh, don't worry about it.

1098
00:57:49,332 --> 00:57:50,832
After you, sir.

1099
00:57:50,867 --> 00:57:52,300
- Psyduck.    - No? Okay.

1100
00:57:52,335 --> 00:57:53,268
I'll go first. Whatever's most calming.

1101
00:57:53,303 --> 00:57:54,603
Hmm, Psyduck.

1102
00:58:11,788 --> 00:58:12,954
Okay.

1103
00:58:14,291 --> 00:58:17,092
Psyduck. Psyduck.

1104
00:58:21,698 --> 00:58:22,698
Oh.

1105
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:26,468
It's okay. You can stay up there.

1106
00:58:33,877 --> 00:58:36,578
I may have amnesia, but I'm pretty sure

1107
00:58:36,613 --> 00:58:39,214
this is the worst idea anyone's ever had.

1108
00:58:42,018 --> 00:58:43,552
What is that?

1109
00:58:44,921 --> 00:58:46,355
I'm not sure.

1110
00:58:49,059 --> 00:58:51,693
Psyduck. Psyduck.

1111
00:58:53,330 --> 00:58:55,196
It's Greninja.

1112
00:58:55,231 --> 00:58:57,098
But they don't look right.

1113
00:58:57,133 --> 00:58:59,167
"Test 22."

1114
00:58:59,202 --> 00:59:00,869
"Power enhancement"?

1115
00:59:02,672 --> 00:59:04,673
They were experimenting on them.

1116
00:59:04,708 --> 00:59:05,707
But why?

1117
00:59:05,742 --> 00:59:07,375
If Roger Clifford's behind this,

1118
00:59:07,410 --> 00:59:10,145
what's he doing experimenting on Pokemon?

1119
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:19,254
A Torterra garden.

1120
00:59:25,295 --> 00:59:27,262
"Pokemon evolution test 33.

1121
00:59:27,297 --> 00:59:29,331
"Growth enhancement."

1122
00:59:29,366 --> 00:59:32,100
They look normal-sized to me.

1123
00:59:32,135 --> 00:59:34,836
Maybe it hasn't started yet.

1124
00:59:34,871 --> 00:59:39,507
It's like they're trying to manipulate Pokemon evolution.

1125
00:59:39,542 --> 00:59:41,977
Is that even possible?

1126
00:59:42,012 --> 00:59:43,845
I don't know.

1127
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:46,782
I need to document all of this, though.

1128
00:59:51,921 --> 00:59:53,622
<i>You go ahead. I'll catch up to you.</i>

1129
00:59:53,657 --> 00:59:55,324
- <i>Are you sure?</i>    - <i>Yeah.</i>

1130
01:00:11,441 --> 01:00:12,641
Whoa.

1131
01:00:14,310 --> 01:00:16,011
What happened here?

1132
01:00:16,046 --> 01:00:17,746
Bad stuff.

1133
01:00:17,781 --> 01:00:20,281
Really bad stuff.

1134
01:00:20,316 --> 01:00:22,751
Still think this was staged?

1135
01:00:29,259 --> 01:00:32,594
Kid, hey! Over here.

1136
01:00:32,629 --> 01:00:35,497
It says Dr. Laurent's station.

1137
01:00:35,532 --> 01:00:37,666
Looks like it's still working.

1138
01:00:46,609 --> 01:00:49,011
<i>Remote access initiated.</i>

1139
01:00:55,885 --> 01:00:57,619
Psyduck!

1140
01:01:03,493 --> 01:01:05,494
Looks like most of the files are corrupted.

1141
01:01:07,430 --> 01:01:10,465
Uh-oh. Another one of those holograms.

1142
01:01:21,444 --> 01:01:23,378
Day 42.

1143
01:01:23,413 --> 01:01:25,280
After much trial and error

1144
01:01:25,315 --> 01:01:27,248
we perfected a stable method

1145
01:01:27,283 --> 01:01:30,652
to extract Mewtwo's DNA.

1146
01:01:30,687 --> 01:01:32,854
It's Mewtwo. No, wait.

1147
01:01:32,889 --> 01:01:35,390
Wait, Mewtwo came from this place?

1148
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:41,596
Day 60. Clinical trials proven successful.

1149
01:01:41,631 --> 01:01:44,532
The inhalant results in confusion

1150
01:01:44,567 --> 01:01:47,669
and the total loss of free will.

1151
01:01:47,704 --> 01:01:51,840
Which, in turn, makes the Pokemon go wild.

1152
01:01:51,875 --> 01:01:56,511
We've designated this chemical as serum R.

1153
01:01:58,515 --> 01:01:59,981
They used Mewtwo to make R.

1154
01:02:00,016 --> 01:02:03,418
And they were testing it at the battles.

1155
01:02:06,790 --> 01:02:09,257
Day 68.

1156
01:02:09,292 --> 01:02:11,693
The neural link is operational.

1157
01:02:11,728 --> 01:02:12,861
<i>Alert.</i>

1158
01:02:12,896 --> 01:02:15,464
<i>-Condition: Red.</i> -Oh.

1159
01:02:18,101 --> 01:02:19,701
No. No, no, no!

1160
01:02:19,736 --> 01:02:21,669
We're losing power in the containment…

1161
01:02:33,817 --> 01:02:35,650
That must've been how Mewtwo escaped.

1162
01:02:35,685 --> 01:02:36,985
Now we're getting somewhere.

1163
01:02:37,020 --> 01:02:39,087
What did that thing want with Harry?

1164
01:02:39,122 --> 01:02:40,455
Good question, kid.

1165
01:02:40,490 --> 01:02:43,091
I'll try and take us back to the beginning.

1166
01:02:48,965 --> 01:02:52,367
Day 1. The lab is almostfully operational.

1167
01:02:52,402 --> 01:02:54,102
All that remains now is to capture

1168
01:02:54,137 --> 01:02:57,372
the most powerful Pokemon known to mankind:

1169
01:02:57,407 --> 01:02:59,607
Mewtwo.

1170
01:02:59,642 --> 01:03:03,511
It escaped nearly 20 years ago from the Kanto region.

1171
01:03:03,546 --> 01:03:04,879
Fortunately, our benefactor's

1172
01:03:04,914 --> 01:03:07,215
hired a specialist to track it down.

1173
01:03:07,250 --> 01:03:08,817
Good luck, Detective Goodman.

1174
01:03:15,658 --> 01:03:17,826
That's why Mewtwo took Harry.

1175
01:03:17,861 --> 01:03:20,128
It was revenge for being captured.

1176
01:03:20,163 --> 01:03:21,496
This doesn't make any sense.

1177
01:03:21,531 --> 01:03:23,097
Harry would've never been a part of this.

1178
01:03:23,132 --> 01:03:24,866
I wanna believe that, kid. But we gotta be honest here.

1179
01:03:24,901 --> 01:03:26,901
You haven't seen him in years, and I got amnesia.

1180
01:03:26,936 --> 01:03:28,303
Neither of us can say for sure

1181
01:03:28,338 --> 01:03:29,737
what Harry would or wouldn't do.

1182
01:03:29,772 --> 01:03:31,105
We gotta get back to the city.

1183
01:03:31,140 --> 01:03:34,442
Lucy. Lucy, we gotta get back to…

1184
01:03:38,848 --> 01:03:40,015
Lucy?

1185
01:03:41,985 --> 01:03:43,184
Lucy?

1186
01:03:50,693 --> 01:03:53,028
That was not there before, kid.

1187
01:03:56,032 --> 01:03:57,432
Ew.

1188
01:04:04,741 --> 01:04:06,574
Look behind you.

1189
01:04:06,609 --> 01:04:08,643
Whoa!

1190
01:04:08,678 --> 01:04:10,011
Kid, the fire alarm!

1191
01:04:14,517 --> 01:04:15,850
Psyduck!

1192
01:04:15,885 --> 01:04:17,552
Come on! Let's go, let's go, let's go!

1193
01:04:20,657 --> 01:04:22,357
- Psyduck!    - Whoa, whoa, whoa! Go back.

1194
01:04:22,392 --> 01:04:24,626
Psyduck!

1195
01:04:26,996 --> 01:04:27,996
Psyduck!

1196
01:04:30,266 --> 01:04:32,200
Psyduck!

1197
01:04:33,536 --> 01:04:35,069
Get down!

1198
01:04:35,104 --> 01:04:37,572
Psyduck!

1199
01:04:38,775 --> 01:04:40,175
Come on!

1200
01:04:41,644 --> 01:04:43,778
Psyduck! Psyduck! Psyduck!

1201
01:04:43,813 --> 01:04:45,680
Psyduck! Psyduck! Psyduck!

1202
01:04:45,715 --> 01:04:48,349
Psyduck! Psyduck! Psyduck!

1203
01:04:48,384 --> 01:04:49,717
Duck! Duck! Duck!

1204
01:04:52,755 --> 01:04:54,923
Psyduck! Psyduck! Psyduck! Psyduck!

1205
01:04:56,893 --> 01:04:58,793
- Psyduck!    - It's okay, Psyduck.

1206
01:04:58,828 --> 01:04:59,994
Everything's fine.

1207
01:05:00,029 --> 01:05:01,562
He's gonna blow his stack, kid.

1208
01:05:01,597 --> 01:05:03,899
It's okay, Psyduck, it's okay. Calm down.

1209
01:05:05,368 --> 01:05:07,269
Psyduck!

1210
01:05:09,172 --> 01:05:10,338
This is no time

1211
01:05:10,373 --> 01:05:11,940
for your stupid headaches.

1212
01:05:11,975 --> 01:05:14,642
No, wait, this is the perfect time to get a headache.

1213
01:05:14,677 --> 01:05:16,811
- Psyduck?    - I hated rubbing your feet.

1214
01:05:16,846 --> 01:05:18,346
Calm down, calm down!

1215
01:05:18,381 --> 01:05:20,248
I'll never forgive my hands for what they did.

1216
01:05:20,283 --> 01:05:23,418
Get a splitting headache now, you neurotic duck!

1217
01:05:23,453 --> 01:05:26,387
Do it! Do it! Do it!

1218
01:05:35,331 --> 01:05:37,065
Psyduck.

1219
01:05:37,100 --> 01:05:39,968
Good job, Psyduck. Where's my hat?

1220
01:05:45,675 --> 01:05:46,942
Something's wrong.

1221
01:06:03,659 --> 01:06:06,127
Is this really happening?

1222
01:06:06,162 --> 01:06:07,495
Don't worry.

1223
01:06:07,530 --> 01:06:10,498
Psyduck's psionic waves are causing hallucinations.

1224
01:06:10,533 --> 01:06:11,866
None of this is real.

1225
01:06:11,901 --> 01:06:13,301
Nope.

1226
01:06:13,336 --> 01:06:15,169
All of this is real! Run!

1227
01:06:15,204 --> 01:06:16,938
Go, go, go!

1228
01:06:24,947 --> 01:06:27,749
- What's happening?    - Let's go! Let's go!

1229
01:06:29,952 --> 01:06:31,352
At this point,

1230
01:06:31,387 --> 01:06:34,823
how could you not believe in climate change?

1231
01:06:48,037 --> 01:06:49,604
Oh no, no, no!

1232
01:06:49,639 --> 01:06:50,839
I got you.

1233
01:06:52,208 --> 01:06:53,208
Tim!

1234
01:06:55,678 --> 01:06:57,845
Go! Run! Run!

1235
01:06:57,880 --> 01:06:59,748
Go, go, go, go!

1236
01:07:01,517 --> 01:07:03,151
Go, go, go!

1237
01:07:05,955 --> 01:07:07,856
Okay.

1238
01:07:16,699 --> 01:07:18,299
We made it.

1239
01:07:19,402 --> 01:07:21,336
I officially hate this forest.

1240
01:07:30,246 --> 01:07:31,246
Tim!

1241
01:07:32,248 --> 01:07:33,381
Lucy!

1242
01:07:33,416 --> 01:07:34,649
Tim!

1243
01:07:35,184 --> 01:07:36,184
Psyduck!

1244
01:07:45,661 --> 01:07:47,495
Kid, the walls are closing in.

1245
01:07:47,530 --> 01:07:50,398
We have to do something and we gotta do it fast.

1246
01:07:50,433 --> 01:07:52,066
I gotta jump for it.

1247
01:07:52,101 --> 01:07:54,368
That's a great fifth option. Let's work on the first four.

1248
01:07:54,403 --> 01:07:56,737
- You're not gonna make it!    - There's no other choice.

1249
01:07:56,772 --> 01:07:58,206
We have a lot of choices.

1250
01:07:58,241 --> 01:07:59,974
Falling to our death is not one of…

1251
01:08:06,782 --> 01:08:08,916
Tim!

1252
01:08:08,951 --> 01:08:11,219
Pull, pull, pull!

1253
01:08:11,254 --> 01:08:12,320
Come on!

1254
01:08:15,892 --> 01:08:18,292
I thought I was gonna… I thought I was gonna…

1255
01:08:18,327 --> 01:08:21,462
I… I…

1256
01:08:21,497 --> 01:08:22,663
Eyeball.

1257
01:08:22,698 --> 01:08:24,833
Eyeball. Eyeball!

1258
01:08:37,013 --> 01:08:39,847
Oh! I get it!

1259
01:08:39,882 --> 01:08:43,451
I get it now. This isn't a forest at all.

1260
01:08:43,486 --> 01:08:47,088
This is the Torterra garden.

1261
01:08:55,531 --> 01:08:56,631
Pikachu!

1262
01:09:22,758 --> 01:09:24,359
Psyduck.

1263
01:09:27,330 --> 01:09:29,430
He's hurt.

1264
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:33,467
- Is he okay?    - I'm in bad shape, kid.

1265
01:09:33,502 --> 01:09:35,336
I'm here, partner. I'm here.

1266
01:09:36,606 --> 01:09:39,240
Did you just call me partner?

1267
01:09:39,275 --> 01:09:41,175
Yeah, of course. You're my partner.

1268
01:09:41,210 --> 01:09:43,778
Yeah, that's right. You've, er…

1269
01:09:44,914 --> 01:09:47,415
You've got my back.

1270
01:09:47,450 --> 01:09:49,250
Hey, hey, hey. Bud.

1271
01:09:49,285 --> 01:09:53,188
Hey! Hey, Pikachu!

1272
01:09:54,590 --> 01:09:56,090
Pikachu!

1273
01:09:56,792 --> 01:09:58,092
No.

1274
01:10:04,500 --> 01:10:06,901
Hey! Hey, help!

1275
01:10:06,936 --> 01:10:08,603
Please!

1276
01:10:08,638 --> 01:10:10,038
Please.

1277
01:10:10,706 --> 01:10:12,106
He's hurt.

1278
01:10:12,608 --> 01:10:13,975
Please.

1279
01:10:17,113 --> 01:10:19,113
He doesn't know what you're saying.

1280
01:10:24,587 --> 01:10:26,354
But he knows what I'm feeling.

1281
01:10:29,558 --> 01:10:32,961
I need to get Pikachu to a healer Pokemon.

1282
01:10:33,629 --> 01:10:35,329
Please.

1283
01:10:35,364 --> 01:10:37,532
I'm begging you.

1284
01:10:38,801 --> 01:10:40,902
I don't wanna lose him, too.

1285
01:10:56,052 --> 01:10:57,485
It's okay.

1286
01:11:01,023 --> 01:11:03,191
Hmm?

1287
01:11:06,128 --> 01:11:09,030
Tim, look.

1288
01:11:36,859 --> 01:11:38,126
Okay.

1289
01:11:40,629 --> 01:11:42,297
I'll meet you at the car.

1290
01:12:18,134 --> 01:12:20,034
You're gonna be okay, partner.

1291
01:13:10,586 --> 01:13:11,619
Here?

1292
01:13:23,632 --> 01:13:25,199
Hey! Wait, wait, wait!

1293
01:13:25,234 --> 01:13:27,301
Where are you going?

1294
01:13:27,336 --> 01:13:29,570
What am I supposed to do?

1295
01:13:29,605 --> 01:13:32,373
I've been waiting for you.

1296
01:13:37,179 --> 01:13:38,379
Mewtwo.

1297
01:13:40,249 --> 01:13:42,216
No, no, no! No, wait!

1298
01:14:00,603 --> 01:14:01,636
Where am I?

1299
01:14:02,204 --> 01:14:03,771
You're okay!

1300
01:14:03,806 --> 01:14:05,072
Yeah.

1301
01:14:05,107 --> 01:14:06,740
Somehow, I'm fine.

1302
01:14:06,775 --> 01:14:09,710
You brought the son to me, as agreed.

1303
01:14:11,347 --> 01:14:12,646
What is he talking about?

1304
01:14:12,681 --> 01:14:15,683
I don't know, kid. I'm as lost as you are.

1305
01:14:15,718 --> 01:14:17,284
Where's my father?

1306
01:14:17,319 --> 01:14:18,619
What'd you do with him?

1307
01:14:30,466 --> 01:14:31,832
- <i>Alert.</i>    - Oh.

1308
01:14:31,867 --> 01:14:34,502
We're losing power in the containment chamber.

1309
01:14:42,011 --> 01:14:43,711
You've done well.

1310
01:14:44,580 --> 01:14:47,281
Humanity is evil.

1311
01:14:47,316 --> 01:14:49,717
I've always believed Pokemon are…

1312
01:14:51,220 --> 01:14:53,687
No!

1313
01:15:04,199 --> 01:15:05,533
No!

1314
01:15:29,425 --> 01:15:31,292
Wait, wait, wait!

1315
01:15:31,327 --> 01:15:33,928
Pikachu! Wait.

1316
01:15:33,963 --> 01:15:37,298
Hey. Slow down. We have to talk about this.

1317
01:15:37,333 --> 01:15:39,066
You have to go on without me.

1318
01:15:39,101 --> 01:15:40,634
What? What are you saying?

1319
01:15:40,669 --> 01:15:43,370
Roger has Mewtwo. Mewtwo has my father.

1320
01:15:43,405 --> 01:15:45,172
We're running out of time. We have a case to solve.

1321
01:15:45,207 --> 01:15:47,374
We already solved mine. I know who I am.

1322
01:15:47,409 --> 01:15:49,843
I'm the guy who betrayed Harry.

1323
01:15:49,878 --> 01:15:51,312
We don't know that.

1324
01:15:51,347 --> 01:15:55,650
We both saw it. I betrayed your father. Which means

1325
01:15:56,418 --> 01:15:57,785
I could betray you, too.

1326
01:15:57,820 --> 01:15:59,853
You wouldn't do that. I don't care what I saw.

1327
01:15:59,888 --> 01:16:01,922
- I know who you are.    - How do you know?

1328
01:16:01,957 --> 01:16:03,257
Because, I…

1329
01:16:03,292 --> 01:16:04,992
I can feel it in my jellies.

1330
01:16:05,027 --> 01:16:06,427
I… I made that up.

1331
01:16:06,462 --> 01:16:08,395
There's no jellies. There's no me.

1332
01:16:08,430 --> 01:16:09,530
I don't believe that.

1333
01:16:09,565 --> 01:16:10,631
You're better off on your own.

1334
01:16:10,666 --> 01:16:11,999
- Come on, Pikachu…    - No! No!

1335
01:16:12,034 --> 01:16:13,567
I need you. Please.

1336
01:16:13,602 --> 01:16:15,336
You have to stay away. It's for your own good.

1337
01:16:15,371 --> 01:16:16,804
No. I'm not letting you go.

1338
01:16:22,277 --> 01:16:23,678
You see?

1339
01:16:25,014 --> 01:16:26,180
I can't help it.

1340
01:16:26,215 --> 01:16:28,215
I hurt the people who need me.

1341
01:16:28,817 --> 01:16:30,418
That's who I am.

1342
01:16:31,086 --> 01:16:32,520
I'm sorry.

1343
01:16:34,256 --> 01:16:35,623
I'm sorry.

1344
01:16:36,191 --> 01:16:37,491
Tim.

1345
01:16:38,761 --> 01:16:40,260
Where's he going?

1346
01:16:40,295 --> 01:16:42,530
Hey, what happened?

1347
01:16:43,298 --> 01:16:45,666
Is Pikachu okay?

1348
01:16:45,701 --> 01:16:48,402
No, he's not.

1349
01:16:48,437 --> 01:16:51,238
Let's go. We gotta get back to the city.

1350
01:16:54,810 --> 01:16:55,876
Okay.

1351
01:16:55,911 --> 01:16:57,578
Come on.

1352
01:16:57,613 --> 01:16:59,346
<i>The 10th anniversary</i>

1353
01:16:59,381 --> 01:17:02,616
<i>Ryme City Pokemon parade is set to begin this afternoon.</i>

1354
01:17:02,651 --> 01:17:05,219
<i>The whole city is converging on downtown</i>

1355
01:17:05,254 --> 01:17:07,488
<i>to watch the day's festivities.</i>

1356
01:17:13,962 --> 01:17:16,330
I don't know what happened between you two,

1357
01:17:16,365 --> 01:17:17,931
but we need to strategize. Wait!

1358
01:17:17,966 --> 01:17:19,299
Where are you going?

1359
01:17:19,334 --> 01:17:20,334
We need to tell the public what we found.

1360
01:17:20,369 --> 01:17:21,669
This is breaking news.

1361
01:17:21,704 --> 01:17:23,937
No. No, you should break the news. You.

1362
01:17:23,972 --> 01:17:25,606
I'm gonna go talk to Howard.

1363
01:17:25,641 --> 01:17:27,007
How…

1364
01:17:27,042 --> 01:17:28,275
Tim!

1365
01:17:28,310 --> 01:17:29,843
How am I supposed to break the news

1366
01:17:29,878 --> 01:17:32,546
when the guy who runs the news is the breaking news?

1367
01:17:32,581 --> 01:17:36,951
Okay, Cynthia. We're live in five, four, three…

1368
01:17:38,587 --> 01:17:40,087
Stay in the car, okay?

1369
01:17:40,122 --> 01:17:41,389
Psyduck!

1370
01:17:55,003 --> 01:17:57,171
Mrs. McMaster. Hi, it's Lucy Stevens,

1371
01:17:57,206 --> 01:17:58,272
- the intern.    - Oh.

1372
01:17:58,307 --> 01:17:59,640
- At CNM?    - Could you…

1373
01:17:59,675 --> 01:18:01,575
Yeah. Erm, I have a story

1374
01:18:01,610 --> 01:18:03,110
that's really important that the people need to hear.

1375
01:18:03,145 --> 01:18:05,045
And I was really hoping you could help me tell it.

1376
01:18:05,080 --> 01:18:06,380
I just need--

1377
01:18:06,415 --> 01:18:08,015
Lucy, please. Take my coffee order.

1378
01:18:08,050 --> 01:18:10,017
Flat white, extra shot.

1379
01:18:13,322 --> 01:18:16,323

I know this place.

1390
01:18:50,359 --> 01:18:52,827
This is the scene of the crash.

1391
01:18:55,230 --> 01:18:56,764
What is that?

1392
01:18:59,935 --> 01:19:01,001
Greninja stars.

1393
01:19:04,973 --> 01:19:06,707
Roger must have sent the Greninjas

1394
01:19:06,742 --> 01:19:09,042
to cause the crash. Which…

1395
01:19:09,077 --> 01:19:11,345
Which means…

1396
01:19:11,380 --> 01:19:14,048
Mewtwo was trying to protect us?

1397
01:19:15,951 --> 01:19:18,085
<i>Advanced holographic imaging.</i>

1398
01:19:18,120 --> 01:19:21,155
It allows us to see things that they cannot

1399
01:19:21,190 --> 01:19:22,756
<i>or don't want us to see.</i>

1400
01:19:22,791 --> 01:19:26,360
Wait, Howard would have seen this in his hologram.

1401
01:19:26,395 --> 01:19:28,395
Oh, no. No, no, no, no.

1402
01:19:28,430 --> 01:19:30,397
Tim!

1403
01:19:30,432 --> 01:19:33,167
Howard! Mr. Clifford! Your son,

1404
01:19:33,202 --> 01:19:35,803
he has Mewtwo here.

1405
01:19:35,838 --> 01:19:38,105
- Wait, why do you…    - Tim.

1406
01:19:38,140 --> 01:19:40,374
It's gonna be okay.

1407
01:19:47,716 --> 01:19:50,084
Run!

1408
01:19:50,986 --> 01:19:52,052
No.

1409
01:20:10,272 --> 01:20:12,540
The transfer worked.

1410
01:20:13,442 --> 01:20:15,442
My body is in the chair,

1411
01:20:16,745 --> 01:20:20,414
but my mind is in Mewtwo.

1412
01:20:20,449 --> 01:20:21,548
Howard?

1413
01:20:21,583 --> 01:20:23,083
Well done, Tim.

1414
01:20:23,118 --> 01:20:27,588
You and Harry's Pikachu led me straight to Mewtwo.

1415
01:20:27,623 --> 01:20:29,256
Mewtwo didn't cause the crash.

1416
01:20:29,291 --> 01:20:30,924
All your father had to do

1417
01:20:30,959 --> 01:20:33,327
was take the money and walk away.

1418
01:20:33,362 --> 01:20:35,095
But he started asking questions.

1419
01:20:35,130 --> 01:20:36,230
I had to stop him.

1420
01:20:36,265 --> 01:20:37,431
You tried to kill him!

1421
01:20:37,466 --> 01:20:38,632
I had no choice.

1422
01:20:38,667 --> 01:20:40,834
He tracked the R to the battles,

1423
01:20:40,869 --> 01:20:42,769
traced it back to Dr. Laurent.

1424
01:20:42,804 --> 01:20:46,039
And then he and his Pikachu helped Mewtwo escape.

1425
01:20:50,379 --> 01:20:51,812
So, as you can see,

1426
01:20:51,847 --> 01:20:53,814
we are more than happy with the turnout today.

1427
01:20:53,849 --> 01:20:55,449
So many families…

1428
01:20:55,484 --> 01:20:57,050
Thank you so much. Thank you.

1429
01:20:57,085 --> 01:20:58,685
That's all for today. Thank you.

1430
01:20:58,720 --> 01:21:00,687
Excuse me, please. Hello. Hi.

1431
01:21:00,722 --> 01:21:02,756
I have an interview with the mayor.

1432
01:21:02,791 --> 01:21:04,391
- Go on through.    - Thank you.

1433
01:21:04,426 --> 01:21:07,094
Mr. Mayor, I need to speak with you, please. It's urgent.

1434
01:21:07,129 --> 01:21:08,829
A little late for an interview, don't you think?

1435
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:09,897
Please!

1436
01:21:11,633 --> 01:21:12,866
Before we begin the parade,

1437
01:21:12,901 --> 01:21:14,902
I'd like to thank our benefactor,

1438
01:21:14,937 --> 01:21:15,969
Howard Clifford.

1439
01:21:16,004 --> 01:21:18,305
This was never about curing me.

1440
01:21:18,340 --> 01:21:22,042
I have found a path forward for all of us.

1441
01:21:22,077 --> 01:21:23,610
Mewtwo has the power

1442
01:21:23,645 --> 01:21:25,479
to transfer the soul of a human

1443
01:21:25,514 --> 01:21:26,914
into the body of a Pokemon,

1444
01:21:26,949 --> 01:21:30,851
as long as the Pokemon are in a crazed state.

1445
01:21:30,886 --> 01:21:33,520
The R gas takes care of that.

1446
01:21:35,223 --> 01:21:38,225
The balloons. The R gas is in the balloons.

1447
01:21:47,736 --> 01:21:50,103
People of Ryme City!

1448
01:21:50,138 --> 01:21:53,206
I've finally discovered a cure.

1449
01:21:53,241 --> 01:21:55,309
Not just for me,

1450
01:21:55,344 --> 01:21:57,911
but for all of humanity!

1451
01:21:57,946 --> 01:22:02,449
Pokemon can evolve into better versions of themselves.

1452
01:22:02,484 --> 01:22:05,052
And, now, so can you!

1453
01:22:05,087 --> 01:22:09,857
Humans and Pokemon merged into one!

1454
01:22:22,371 --> 01:22:25,039
Don't let your Pokemon breathe the purple gas!

1455
01:22:27,476 --> 01:22:28,842
Come on! Get out of here!

1456
01:22:32,714 --> 01:22:35,048
This is Yoshida requesting backup!

1457
01:22:35,083 --> 01:22:37,851
All units should proceed to the…

1458
01:22:37,886 --> 01:22:40,254
Snubbull, no!

1459
01:22:50,165 --> 01:22:52,332
Don't let your Pokemon breathe the gas!

1460
01:22:52,367 --> 01:22:53,667
Don't let your Pokemon…

1461
01:22:53,702 --> 01:22:55,635
Oh, no! Don't breathe the gas!

1462
01:22:58,707 --> 01:23:00,240
Tell them!

1463
01:23:00,275 --> 01:23:02,009
This is Lucy Stevens reporting a citywide emergency.

1464
01:23:02,044 --> 01:23:03,710
Do not let your Pokemon breathe…

1465
01:23:03,745 --> 01:23:05,145
Psyduck, no! Don't!

1466
01:23:07,616 --> 01:23:10,718
Psyduck, Psyduck. Psyduck!

1467
01:23:13,355 --> 01:23:14,755
Psyduck?

1468
01:23:22,798 --> 01:23:26,066
Okay. Worst parade I've ever seen.

1469
01:23:26,101 --> 01:23:28,802
- Psyduck.    - Lucy. Lucy, you're in there?

1470
01:23:28,837 --> 01:23:30,737
- Where's Tim?    - Psyduck. Psyduck.

1471
01:23:30,772 --> 01:23:35,242
- Howard is Mewtwo?    - Psyduck. Psyduck.

1472
01:23:35,277 --> 01:23:39,046
This really blows my bridge discovery out of the water.

1473
01:23:39,081 --> 01:23:42,015
All right, I gotta stop this.

1474
01:23:42,050 --> 01:23:43,050
Game on!

1475
01:23:53,061 --> 01:23:56,296
Okay, Pikachu, your powers are in there somewhere.

1476
01:23:56,331 --> 01:23:57,664
Just need a little spark

1477
01:23:57,699 --> 01:23:59,566
to get this party started. Let's do this.

1478
01:24:07,275 --> 01:24:09,443
Harry's Pikachu.

1479
01:24:10,946 --> 01:24:14,347
You think you can stand in the way of the future?

1480
01:24:14,382 --> 01:24:16,316
I am the future!

1481
01:24:27,562 --> 01:24:28,762
Whoa!

1482
01:24:58,727 --> 01:25:00,494
He's back!

1483
01:25:10,272 --> 01:25:11,872
The neural link.

1484
01:25:18,380 --> 01:25:19,379
Roger?

1485
01:25:22,584 --> 01:25:23,884
Behind you!

1486
01:25:37,899 --> 01:25:39,233
You're a Ditto.

1487
01:25:40,402 --> 01:25:41,401
Ditto.

1488
01:25:52,714 --> 01:25:54,981
Bank left! Bank right! Right!

1489
01:25:55,016 --> 01:25:58,185
Where did you learn how to fly? The ground?

1490
01:25:58,220 --> 01:26:01,221
No, no, no. Stop, stop, stop! Wait, wait, wait!

1491
01:26:02,691 --> 01:26:03,891
Wait, wait, wait!

1492
01:26:09,164 --> 01:26:11,565
Come on. No. That's not fair.

1493
01:26:15,837 --> 01:26:17,404
For the record, I have no guilt

1494
01:26:17,439 --> 01:26:19,372
hitting a beady-eyed version of the woman

1495
01:26:19,407 --> 01:26:20,507
I'm very attracted to.

1496
01:26:25,080 --> 01:26:28,182
Uh-oh! Pull up, pull up. Don't breathe the gas.

1497
01:26:29,351 --> 01:26:31,051
You breathed the gas, didn't you?

1498
01:26:39,728 --> 01:26:40,827
Yeah!

1499
01:27:05,687 --> 01:27:07,454
Finish him, Ditto!

1500
01:27:07,489 --> 01:27:08,488
Ditto!

1501
01:27:19,367 --> 01:27:21,535
No! No, no, no, no!

1502
01:27:27,342 --> 01:27:28,475
Pikachu!

1503
01:27:29,611 --> 01:27:32,045
Tim!

1504
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:35,115
Harry's son is finished!

1505
01:27:35,150 --> 01:27:38,551
No. Tim said Volt Tackle's my best move.

1506
01:27:38,586 --> 01:27:41,521
Let's do this Pokemon battle thing right.

1507
01:27:51,399 --> 01:27:52,232
No.

1508
01:28:00,308 --> 01:28:01,374
Yeah!

1509
01:28:01,409 --> 01:28:03,410
Give me your hand! Give me your hand!

1510
01:28:08,316 --> 01:28:10,116
What kind of a Ditto was that?

1511
01:28:10,151 --> 01:28:13,586
That was one of my father's genetic experiments.

1512
01:28:42,450 --> 01:28:44,551
Psyduck. Ditto.

1513
01:28:44,586 --> 01:28:46,320
Ditto…

1514
01:28:58,666 --> 01:29:00,200
A feeble effort.

1515
01:29:00,235 --> 01:29:05,138
A Pikachu cannot defeat Mewtwo in battle.

1516
01:29:05,173 --> 01:29:07,674
I didn't need to defeat you.

1517
01:29:07,709 --> 01:29:10,177
I just needed to distract you.

1518
01:29:12,514 --> 01:29:13,513
Huh.

1519
01:29:14,582 --> 01:29:15,716
No!

1520
01:29:16,384 --> 01:29:17,584
No!

1521
01:29:21,856 --> 01:29:24,091
What have you done?

1522
01:29:26,628 --> 01:29:28,061
Pikachu!

1523
01:29:28,863 --> 01:29:30,097
No!

1524
01:29:44,312 --> 01:29:46,980
- Pikachu!    - Tim!

1525
01:29:47,015 --> 01:29:48,515
- Oh!    - Are you okay?

1526
01:29:48,550 --> 01:29:51,184
I'm sorry. I'm sorry I pushed you away

1527
01:29:51,219 --> 01:29:53,019
just when you needed me the most.

1528
01:29:53,054 --> 01:29:55,355
I'm just happy you're back…

1529
01:29:56,558 --> 01:29:57,591
partner.

1530
01:29:59,527 --> 01:30:02,328
Please tell me you can fix this mess.

1531
01:30:02,363 --> 01:30:05,732
I will undo what has been done.

1532
01:30:36,531 --> 01:30:40,167
Let's never do that again, okay?

1533
01:30:55,884 --> 01:30:59,619
The strange thing is that, no matter what his flaws,

1534
01:30:59,654 --> 01:31:01,721
deep down,

1535
01:31:01,756 --> 01:31:05,258
I blame myself for not being there for him.

1536
01:31:05,293 --> 01:31:07,727
You. You were working on this story.

1537
01:31:07,762 --> 01:31:10,697
Had a lead on it before anyone else even knew.

1538
01:31:10,732 --> 01:31:11,798
That's correct.

1539
01:31:11,833 --> 01:31:13,333
Good. Right, you're going on camera.

1540
01:31:13,368 --> 01:31:15,034
I want you giving an in-depth report

1541
01:31:15,069 --> 01:31:17,036
for CNM tonight, primetime.

1542
01:31:17,071 --> 01:31:18,605
And make sure you close with:

1543
01:31:18,640 --> 01:31:21,074
"Roger Clifford pledges to undo

1544
01:31:21,109 --> 01:31:23,176
all the harm his father caused

1545
01:31:23,211 --> 01:31:26,780
starting with the Pokemon he experimented on."

1546
01:31:29,517 --> 01:31:31,684
I can't believe we did it.

1547
01:31:31,719 --> 01:31:33,119
Psyduck.

1548
01:31:33,154 --> 01:31:36,789
Great work. Hey, calm down. Stay calm. Okay.

1549
01:31:36,824 --> 01:31:38,091
Oh, I hope we never

1550
01:31:38,126 --> 01:31:39,659
- get to see each other again.    - Hmm.

1551
01:31:39,694 --> 01:31:43,029
- Meet me later tonight?    - Cool. I mean, yeah.

1552
01:31:43,064 --> 01:31:44,798
Okay.

1553
01:31:46,634 --> 01:31:47,634
Come on.

1554
01:31:47,669 --> 01:31:49,235
Psyduck. Psyduck. Psyduck.

1555
01:31:50,705 --> 01:31:51,872
Way to go, Tim.

1556
01:31:53,441 --> 01:31:57,177
There is one last thing I must fix.

1557
01:32:00,949 --> 01:32:02,482
My father.

1558
01:32:02,517 --> 01:32:05,018
The father you have been looking for

1559
01:32:05,053 --> 01:32:07,754
has been with you all along.

1560
01:32:09,490 --> 01:32:11,391
What's he talking about?

1561
01:32:12,961 --> 01:32:14,327
I don't…

1562
01:32:33,548 --> 01:32:34,847
Pika!

1563
01:32:34,882 --> 01:32:36,950
Pikachu!

1564
01:32:36,985 --> 01:32:38,785
You've done well.

1565
01:32:38,820 --> 01:32:41,721
Humanity is evil.

1566
01:32:41,756 --> 01:32:46,660
But you have shown me that not all humans are bad.

1567
01:32:47,729 --> 01:32:49,028
Harry Goodman,

1568
01:32:49,063 --> 01:32:53,232
your Pikachu offers its body to save your mind.

1569
01:32:53,267 --> 01:32:55,535
There is a son.

1570
01:32:55,570 --> 01:32:59,505
With the son's return, I can repair the father.

1571
01:32:59,540 --> 01:33:01,407
Your memory will be gone,

1572
01:33:01,442 --> 01:33:04,777
but your heart will know who you are.

1573
01:33:04,812 --> 01:33:08,448
I take this body so that you might live.

1574
01:33:09,317 --> 01:33:11,751
Return with the son.

1575
01:33:33,074 --> 01:33:35,608
<i>Now boarding on track three,</i>

1576
01:33:35,643 --> 01:33:37,977
<i>train 453 northbound.</i>

1577
01:33:42,383 --> 01:33:43,817
Hey, kid!

1578
01:34:00,802 --> 01:34:03,003
Grams will meet you when you arrive.

1579
01:34:04,205 --> 01:34:05,472
Okay.

1580
01:34:12,180 --> 01:34:13,680
I'll see ya.

1581
01:34:15,249 --> 01:34:16,616
See ya.

1582
01:34:42,710 --> 01:34:43,877
Pika.

1583
01:34:47,115 --> 01:34:48,548
Hey, Dad?

1584
01:34:49,784 --> 01:34:50,784
Yeah?

1585
01:34:52,754 --> 01:34:54,888
You think I can stay with you for a while?

1586
01:34:57,592 --> 01:34:59,492
I'd like that, kid.

1587
01:35:00,361 --> 01:35:02,529
Yeah, I'd like that very much.

1588
01:35:05,767 --> 01:35:07,000
Me, too.

1589
01:35:18,112 --> 01:35:19,512
You wanna get a coffee?

1590
01:35:19,547 --> 01:35:20,813
It's the weirdest thing.

1591
01:35:20,848 --> 01:35:22,515
That's all I've been thinking about,

1592
01:35:22,550 --> 01:35:24,250
is having a coffee right now.

1593
01:35:25,686 --> 01:35:27,920
I think I'll have to find a new job.

1594
01:35:27,955 --> 01:35:31,057
Oh, yeah? What are you thinking?

1595
01:35:31,092 --> 01:35:34,260
Erm… maybe I could give detective work a try?

1596
01:35:34,295 --> 01:35:36,062
Pika-Pika!

1597
01:35:36,097 --> 01:35:38,531
I think he likes that idea.
