00:01:03,646 --> 00:01:09,486
《POKÉMON 神探 Pikachu》

2
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:47,065
佢哋喺外面
They're outside.

3
00:01:48,316 --> 00:01:50,235
警告，红色警戒
<i>Alert. Condition: Red.</i>

4
00:01:51,211 --> 00:01:52,511
密闭室能源不足
We're losing power

5
00:01:52,511 --> 00:01:53,812
密闭室能源不足
in the containment chamber.

6
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:10,190
你听唔听到？
You hear that?

7
00:03:10,482 --> 00:03:11,566
有嘢喺附近
Something's close.

8
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,960
就系呢种感觉，心跳加速
See? This is what I'm talking about.

9
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,561
就系呢种感觉，心跳加速
My heart is pounding.

10
00:03:16,654 --> 00:03:18,031
趴低
Get down, get down.

11
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:24,454
卡拉
Cubone.

12
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,418
系只卡拉卡拉？
A Cubone?

13
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:36,341
我哋唔系嚟帮你捉Pokémon
We're not catching you a Pokemon, are we?

14
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:38,434
﹣咩话？　　﹣话我知你冇预谋，杰克
What?

15
00:03:38,434 --> 00:03:39,918
﹣咩话？　　﹣话我知你冇预谋，杰克
Tell me you didn't plan this, Jack.

16
00:03:39,953 --> 00:03:41,303
﹣你讲咩呀？　　﹣老实讲，你系咪早有预谋
Jack, tell me

17
00:03:41,303 --> 00:03:42,654
﹣你讲咩呀？　　﹣老实讲，你系咪早有预谋
- you didn't plan this.    - Are you serious?

18
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:45,350
你斗胆质疑我？我梗系冇
How dare you. Okay? Of course not. Come on.

19
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:47,727
有少少啦
Okay, maybe.

20
00:03:49,029 --> 00:03:50,462
㖊晚月圆　阿妈听到佢咿哇鬼叫
There was a full moon last night

21
00:03:50,462 --> 00:03:51,896
㖊晚月圆　阿妈听到佢咿哇鬼叫
and my mom heard it crying its eyes out.

22
00:03:51,931 --> 00:03:53,615
佢以为我发恶梦　仲畀杯暖牛奶我饮
She thought I was having a nightmare,

23
00:03:53,615 --> 00:03:55,300
佢以为我发恶梦　仲畀杯暖牛奶我饮
so she brought me a glass of warm milk.

24
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:57,404
我以为你想同我散心
Dude, I thought you wanted to, you know, hang out

25
00:03:57,671 --> 00:03:58,754
好似以前细个咁
and relive the good old days.

26
00:03:58,754 --> 00:03:59,838
好似以前细个咁
Like when we were kids.

27
00:03:59,823 --> 00:04:02,659
我系呀，但系你睇吓佢
I do. But just look at it.

28
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:05,620
简直系为你而设嘅Pokémon
That is the perfect Pokemon for you.

29
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:10,542
杰克，我一早讲过　我唔想要Pokémon
Jack, I'm not looking for a Pokemon. I've told you this.

30
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:12,627
我谂过晒
I've thought long and hard about this, okay?

31
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,353
水系唔啱你，火系都唔啱　但系卡拉卡拉⋯
Water-type is not right for you.

32
00:04:14,353 --> 00:04:15,787
水系唔啱你，火系都唔啱　但系卡拉卡拉⋯
Neither is Fire-type. But Cubone is--

33
00:04:15,822 --> 00:04:17,389
﹣够孤独　　﹣冇错
Lonely.

34
00:04:17,389 --> 00:04:18,957
﹣够孤独　　﹣冇错
Exactly.

35
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:21,011
杰克，真系多谢晒
Okay, thank you, Jack. Thank you for that.

36
00:04:21,227 --> 00:04:22,778
仲有冇其他情感真相要揭晓？
Are there any other emotional truth-bombs

37
00:04:22,778 --> 00:04:24,329
仲有冇其他情感真相要揭晓？
you wanna drop on me?

38
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:26,683
迟啲先讲，而家真相就喺我手中
Maybe later. But right now the truth is in my hands.

39
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:33,023
﹣畀个精灵球嚟　　﹣好，好！
- Just give me the Ball.    - Yes. Yes!

40
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:36,109
记住，捉Pokémon唔系靠技巧
Okay, remember, catching a Pokemon is not about skill.

41
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:37,277
所以你都可以
So you can do this.

42
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:38,486
多谢你支持
Good pep talk.

43
00:04:38,578 --> 00:04:40,979
都要佢拣你　你要令佢想做你拍档，加油
Okay. It has to choose you, too.

44
00:04:40,979 --> 00:04:43,381
都要佢拣你　你要令佢想做你拍档，加油
So make it wanna be your partner.

45
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:45,133
喂，卡拉卡拉，你好吗？　你知嘛⋯
Hey, Cubone. What's up, buddy?

46
00:04:45,133 --> 00:04:46,851
喂，卡拉卡拉，你好吗？　你知嘛⋯
You know,

47
00:04:46,886 --> 00:04:49,304
唔系个个都适合　戴住自己亲戚嘅骷髅头
not everyone can pull off

48
00:04:49,304 --> 00:04:51,723
唔系个个都适合　戴住自己亲戚嘅骷髅头
wearing the skull of their dead relative,

49
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:53,710
但系你衬得起
but, you know, you sure can.

50
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:58,006
唉，佢唔受
Okay, he didn't like that.

51
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:00,175
佢真系唔受
He did not like that.

52
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:04,095
杰克
Jack.

53
00:05:04,596 --> 00:05:05,680
快啲抛！
Throw it!

54
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:07,140
抛精灵球
Throw the Ball.

55
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:08,558
畀啲男子气概
Like a man.

56
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:15,398
喔噢，卡拉
Uh-oh. Cubone.

57
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:17,275
卡拉！
Cubone!

58
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:21,696
得咗！
I did it!

59
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:25,116
仲未生锈
Still got it.

60
00:05:29,204 --> 00:05:31,081
盏灯冇变绿色
The light's not green.

61
00:05:31,231 --> 00:05:32,614
仲未变绿色　杰克，系咪唔妥？
It still hasn't turned green yet, Jack.

62
00:05:32,614 --> 00:05:33,998
仲未变绿色　杰克，系咪唔妥？
That's bad, right?

63
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,293
走呀！
Run!

64
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:41,883
﹣佢唔拣我！　　﹣走呀！
- It didn't choose me!    - Run!

65
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:44,594
﹣佢唔拣我呀，杰克！　　﹣睇得出！
- It didn't choose me, Jack!    - I can see that!

66
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:45,762
我唔啱佢心水！
I'm not its choice!

67
00:05:52,394 --> 00:05:53,770
卡拉！
Cubone!

68
00:05:54,554 --> 00:05:56,421
𠮶只卡拉卡拉好燥底　令我谂起我阿妈
<i>That was one angry Cubone.</i>

69
00:05:56,421 --> 00:05:58,289
𠮶只卡拉卡拉好燥底　令我谂起我阿妈
<i>He reminded me a lot of my mom.</i>

70
00:05:58,324 --> 00:06:00,025
即系咁，我都唔想太老套⋯
So, um, I don't know if this is gonna sound

71
00:06:00,025 --> 00:06:01,726
即系咁，我都唔想太老套⋯
corny or whatever--

72
00:06:01,653 --> 00:06:03,905
照直讲啦，杰克　我已经攰到冇力嬲
Just say it, Jack. I'm too tired to be angry.

73
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:05,448
我好担心你
I'm worried about you.

74
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:06,700
又嚟？
This again?

75
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:08,600
我哋识嘅人都搬走晒　我都就走
Hey, listen, everyone we know has left town

76
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,068
我哋识嘅人都搬走晒　我都就走
and now I'm leaving, too.

77
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:11,037
系，不过唔紧要
Yeah, but that's okay.

78
00:06:11,337 --> 00:06:12,504
大家都要把握光阴　为自己著想，我都系
You gotta do what's best for you

79
00:06:12,504 --> 00:06:13,671
大家都要把握光阴　为自己著想，我都系
with the time that you got.

80
00:06:13,671 --> 00:06:14,839
大家都要把握光阴　为自己著想，我都系
That's what I'm doing.

81
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:16,668
我返工表现一流
You know, I'm crushing it at work.

82
00:06:16,835 --> 00:06:18,962
应该就嚟升职
I'm gonna get a promotion real soon.

83
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:21,923
保险估价员可以升咩职？
What's the promotion for an insurance appraiser?

84
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:24,175
高级保险估价员？
"Senior insurance appraiser"?

85
00:06:24,417 --> 00:06:26,018
我要升多两级先到高级
No, actually, that's two steps up

86
00:06:26,018 --> 00:06:27,619
我要升多两级先到高级
above where I'm at right now.

87
00:06:27,654 --> 00:06:29,388
听到都想呕，咪玩啦
You're gonna make me throw up.

88
00:06:29,388 --> 00:06:31,122
听到都想呕，咪玩啦
That's not a real thing.

89
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:33,059
终于收到讯号
Oh, I finally have service.

90
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:35,193
五个留言？点会有五个留言？
Wait, five voicemails?

91
00:06:35,193 --> 00:06:36,661
五个留言？点会有五个留言？
Why would I have five voicemails?

92
00:06:36,855 --> 00:06:38,857
可能系保险意外
Maybe it's an insurance emergency.

93
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:43,778
边个？
Who is it?

94
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:50,410
系莱姆市警局
Um, it's the Ryme City Police Department.

95
00:06:51,453 --> 00:06:52,996
发生咗意外
There was an accident.

96
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:12,849
（车祸引发火灾，警探丧生）

97
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:26,279
唔好
Please don't.

98
00:07:26,513 --> 00:07:28,146
Mmm.

99
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:30,784
我系话「唔该」，唔该你
I actually meant, "Please do". Thank you.

100
00:07:31,368 --> 00:07:34,120
多谢晒，你条脷好「大方」
Thank you. You have a very generous tongue.

101
00:07:37,499 --> 00:07:39,417
只大舌头系边个㗎？
Does this Lickitung belong to anyone?

102
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:42,295
有冇人认？
Anybody? No?

103
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,214
感谢你乘坐本列车
<i>Thank you for travelling with us.</i>

104
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:47,092
请收睇以下一段短片
<i>Please sit back and watch this short informational video</i>

105
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:49,052
欢迎你嚟到莱姆市
<i>welcoming you to Ryme City.</i>

106
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:51,653
一直以来　Pokémon系我哋世界嘅一部分
<i>Throughout history,</i>

107
00:07:51,653 --> 00:07:53,471
一直以来　Pokémon系我哋世界嘅一部分
<i>Pokemon have been part of our world.</i>

108
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:54,599
杰尼
<i>Squirtle.</i>

109
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:56,601
早期人类会捕捉佢哋
<i>Early humans used to catch them</i>

110
00:07:56,709 --> 00:07:59,511
训练佢哋用特殊能力　造福人群
<i>and train them to use their unique powers</i>

111
00:07:59,511 --> 00:08:02,313
训练佢哋用特殊能力　造福人群
<i>for the common good.</i>

112
00:08:02,348 --> 00:08:05,017
时至今日，呢种关系进化成　Pokémon对战
<i>This relationship evolved</i>

113
00:08:05,017 --> 00:08:07,686
时至今日，呢种关系进化成　Pokémon对战
<i>into what we now refer to as Pokemon battles.</i>

114
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:13,743
一个人改变咗呢一切
<i>One man changed all of this.</i>

115
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:16,661
霍华德克里佛　克里佛企业，创办人兼主席
<i>Howard Clifford,</i>

116
00:08:16,661 --> 00:08:19,330
霍华德克里佛　克里佛企业，创办人兼主席
<i>founder and chairman of Clifford Industries.</i>

117
00:08:19,374 --> 00:08:22,168
佢患有一种罕见退化症
<i>Diagnosed with a rare degenerative disease,</i>

118
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:24,519
自此辞去公司职务　周游世界寻找治疗方法
<i>he resigned from his corporation</i>

119
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:26,704
自此辞去公司职务　周游世界寻找治疗方法
<i>and searched the world for a cure.</i>

120
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:30,260
到头来　我一直寻找嘅疗法
<i>And it turned out that the cure I was looking for</i>

121
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:33,805
其实就系要我自己　进化成一个更好嘅版本
<i>was for me to evolve into a better version of myself.</i>

122
00:08:33,813 --> 00:08:35,380
我发现人同Pokémon嘅联系　可以达到呢一点
<i>And I discovered how to do that</i>

123
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:36,948
我发现人同Pokémon嘅联系　可以达到呢一点
<i>through a partnership with Pokemon.</i>

124
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:40,645
佢想同全世界分享呢个发现
<i>And he wanted to share that discovery with the world.</i>

125
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:43,088
于是霍华德克里佛　建设咗莱姆市⋯
<i>This is what inspired</i>

126
00:08:43,088 --> 00:08:44,822
于是霍华德克里佛　建设咗莱姆市⋯
<i>Howard Clifford to build Ryme City,</i>

127
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:49,612
一个人类同Pokémon　一齐生活嘅城市
<i>a place where humans and Pokemon can live side by side.</i>

128
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:53,491
其他地区嘅Pokémon　生活喺野外⋯
<i>Unlike other regions, where Pokemon live in the wild,</i>

129
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:56,661
但系呢度嘅Pokémon　同人类互助共存
<i>here, we live and work together.</i>

130
00:08:56,828 --> 00:09:00,957
冇对战，冇训练员，冇精灵球
<i>No battles. No Trainers. No Poke Balls.</i>

131
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:04,461
一个更和谐、更团结嘅世界
<i>A stronger, more harmonious world.</i>

132
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:10,091
莱姆市全体市民欢迎你
<i>From all our citizens: Welcome to Ryme City.</i>

133
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:13,053
小火！小火龙！
Char! Charmander!

134
00:10:01,567 --> 00:10:03,435
消防员同杰尼龟同心协力，扑灭火灾
<i>Fighting fires wouldn't be the same</i>

135
00:10:03,435 --> 00:10:05,303
消防员同杰尼龟同心协力，扑灭火灾
<i>without their Squirtle partners.</i>

136
00:10:05,397 --> 00:10:08,817
杰尼，杰尼，杰尼，杰尼
<i>Squirtle, Squirtle. Squirtle, Squirtle.</i>

137
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:28,128

你爸爸系精英中嘅精英
Your dad was the best of the best.

142
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:50,775
呢个环头嘅传奇人物
He was a legend in this precinct.

143
00:10:51,943 --> 00:10:54,946
多谢你咁讲
Thank you. Thank you for saying that.

144
00:10:55,739 --> 00:10:59,367
冇咗佢同埋佢拍档　实在可惜
It was a terrible tragedy, losing him and his partner.

145
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:01,226
﹣佢拍档？　　﹣佢只Pokémon
His partner?

146
00:11:01,226 --> 00:11:02,493
﹣佢拍档？　　﹣佢只Pokémon
His Pokemon.

147
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:03,705
我都唔知⋯

Okay, bad idea with the knife. I'll find something else.

293
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:38,113
食生果！
Eat this!

294
00:20:38,655 --> 00:20:41,366
唔使客气，睇落佢好饿
You are so welcome. He was just a hungry little guy…

295
00:20:41,658 --> 00:20:43,368
弊家伙！
Oh, my God!

296
00:20:44,703 --> 00:20:46,871
唔对路，走为上著
Come on, kid. Let's move.

297
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:51,668
上屋顶！
To the roof!

298
00:21:02,361 --> 00:21:04,512
好主意！你顶住度门，我去求救
Brilliant idea! You hold the door.

299
00:21:04,512 --> 00:21:06,664
好主意！你顶住度门，我去求救
- I'll go get help.    - What?

300
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:09,519
救命呀！救命呀！
Help! Help! Oh, my God! Help!

301
00:21:13,982 --> 00:21:15,191
大镬！
Oh, sh…

302
00:21:16,651 --> 00:21:19,320
救命呀！快啲嚟救人呀！
Help! Help! Oh, my God, help!

303
00:21:19,487 --> 00:21:23,825
畀佢哋生吞喇！死喇佢！
Oh, he's being eaten alive! He's being eaten alive!

304
00:21:23,992 --> 00:21:25,827
佢死梗喇！
A man is dying!

305
00:21:35,712 --> 00:21:37,756
完全冇人理，个个见死不救
No one's coming. People are so insensitive.

306
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:39,481
快啲著返条裤，走啦
Uh-oh. Put your pants back on

307
00:21:39,481 --> 00:21:41,232
快啲著返条裤，走啦
and run like the wind.

308
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:45,388
快啲，快啲！
Blazing speed! Blazing speed!

309
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:50,810
你身上越少布　好似越吸引佢哋
No, they seem to be attracted to your increasing nudeness.

310
00:21:51,443 --> 00:21:53,177
Okay.

311
00:21:53,229 --> 00:21:54,814
好啦，呢度跳落去
All right, we're jumping down here.

312
00:21:54,981 --> 00:21:56,649
唔得！我唔会跳落垃圾槽
No! No! I'm not going in the trash chute.

313
00:21:56,882 --> 00:21:58,716
好主意，你即管留低陪佢哋
Good call. Let me know how it goes

314
00:21:58,716 --> 00:22:00,551
好主意，你即管留低陪佢哋
with the super crazy Pokemon.

315
00:22:00,445 --> 00:22:01,863
壮烈牺牲
You died a hero.

316
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:11,312
﹣落地几靓　　﹣唔好再烦我！
Way to stick the landing, kid.

317
00:22:11,312 --> 00:22:12,463
﹣落地几靓　　﹣唔好再烦我！
Leave me alone!

318
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:17,253
班友好似下咗啖气
Oh. Looks like someone's back in a good mood.

319
00:22:17,629 --> 00:22:20,131
走呀！长尾怪手癫咗呀！
Run! Rabid Aipom!

320
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:22,550
小心！快啲走！
Look out! Run!

321
00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:26,429
快啲走！佢哋⋯
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! They're… Go! They…

322
00:22:27,681 --> 00:22:30,934
你最好就著返条裤先
I think pants are gonna do you a lot of good right now.

323
00:22:34,312 --> 00:22:35,146
走开！
Shoo! Go.

324
00:22:35,254 --> 00:22:36,904
以为你会著三角裤　但系呢条都唔错
You know, I pictured you

325
00:22:36,904 --> 00:22:38,555
以为你会著三角裤　但系呢条都唔错
as a bit of a briefs guy, but those are nice.

326
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:42,070
我就唔著底裤，豪迈啲嘛
Me? I don't wear underwear, you know? I'm not modest.

327
00:22:42,227 --> 00:22:43,828
唔好意思，妳听唔听到佢讲乜？
Excuse me, excuse me, hi. Sorry.

328
00:22:43,828 --> 00:22:45,429
唔好意思，妳听唔听到佢讲乜？
Uh, you can hear him, right? You can hear him talking?

329
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:47,450
Pika﹣Pika
- Pika-Pika. Pika. Pikachu.    - Aw.

330
00:22:47,617 --> 00:22:50,662
听到，Pika﹣Pika　佢好可爱
Yeah. Pika-Pika. Pika. He's adorable.

331
00:22:50,829 --> 00:22:52,706
妳都好可爱　佢哋听唔明㗎
You're adorable. They can't understand me, kid.

332
00:22:52,872 --> 00:22:55,375
系我，系我头先索咗𠮶啲嘢
It's me. It's that stuff that I put up my nose.

333
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:57,876
唔系妳谂𠮶啲，系气体　我索咗啲气体，只系意外⋯
Not like that. No, it was a gas.

334
00:22:57,876 --> 00:22:59,377
唔系妳谂𠮶啲，系气体　我索咗啲气体，只系意外⋯
- I was breathing gas.    - Hey, hey, hey.

335
00:22:59,377 --> 00:23:00,878
唔系妳谂𠮶啲，系气体　我索咗啲气体，只系意外⋯
Accidentally. I was accidentally…

336
00:23:00,797 --> 00:23:02,799
唔好再提索嘢
Ix-nay on the gas-ay.

337
00:23:02,781 --> 00:23:04,198
因住拉你坐监，走啦
Unless you want Johnny Law to give you

338
00:23:04,198 --> 00:23:05,616
因住拉你坐监，走啦
a one-way ticket to the hoosegow, let's move.

339
00:23:05,651 --> 00:23:06,840
﹣冇人听到？佢讲紧人话　　﹣我都系第一次
No one else can hear him?

340
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,029
﹣冇人听到？佢讲紧人话　　﹣我都系第一次
This is a first for me, too, kid.

341
00:23:08,029 --> 00:23:09,219
﹣冇人听到？佢讲紧人话　　﹣我都系第一次
He's saying words.

342
00:23:09,254 --> 00:23:10,254
我讲嘢　个个都只听到「Pika﹣Pika」
Try to talk to people all the time.

343
00:23:10,254 --> 00:23:11,255
我讲嘢　个个都只听到「Pika﹣Pika」
All they hear is "Pika-Pika".

344
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:12,774
然后就摸我，锡我　揾手指笃我，好鬼核突
They pat me or kiss me,

345
00:23:12,774 --> 00:23:14,258
然后就摸我，锡我　揾手指笃我，好鬼核突
stick a finger in me. It's really gross.

346
00:23:14,293 --> 00:23:16,110
冇人听得明佢？你听唔明？　听唔明佢讲嘢？
Can no one else hear him?

347
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:17,928
冇人听得明佢？你听唔明？　听唔明佢讲嘢？
Can you hear him talking? Do you hear him saying words?

348
00:23:17,963 --> 00:23:19,630
点解你仲唔明？　得你一个明我
What are you not getting here, kid?

349
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:21,298
点解你仲唔明？　得你一个明我
You're the only one who can hear me.

350
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:23,236
﹣系命中注定　　﹣唔系命中注定
- It's like destiny.    - It's not destiny.

351
00:23:23,335 --> 00:23:25,353
﹣你点解会去𠮶间屋？　　﹣间屋系我阿爸屋企
Then why were you in that apartment?

352
00:23:25,353 --> 00:23:27,371
﹣你点解会去𠮶间屋？　　﹣间屋系我阿爸屋企
It's my father's place. That's why I was there.

353
00:23:27,449 --> 00:23:29,743
﹣你又点解喺𠮶度？　　﹣你系哈利个仔？
- Why were you there?    - You're Harry's son?

354
00:23:33,538 --> 00:23:35,206
你点知佢个名？
How do you know his name?

355
00:23:38,335 --> 00:23:40,837
（如寻获，请送还哈利古德曼）

356
00:23:43,381 --> 00:23:45,425
你系哈利嘅Pokémon拍档？
You're Harry's Pokemon partner?

357
00:23:46,801 --> 00:23:48,303
饮唔饮咖啡？
You want a coffee?

358
00:23:50,028 --> 00:23:52,029
我想饮番杯，我哋去饮咖啡
'Cause I could use a coffee. I mean…

359
00:23:52,029 --> 00:23:54,031
我想饮番杯，我哋去饮咖啡
Yeah. Let's get a coffee.

360
00:23:53,933 --> 00:23:55,769
嚟啦
Yeah. Come on.

361
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:08,615
（高帽咖啡馆）

362
00:24:08,714 --> 00:24:11,115
当我清醒之后，严重失忆
<i>So there I was in the middle of nowhere</i>

363
00:24:11,115 --> 00:24:13,517
当我清醒之后，严重失忆
<i>with a bad case of the forgetsies.</i>

364
00:24:13,552 --> 00:24:15,436
过去嘅唯一线索　就系帽入面哈利个名同地址
The only clue to my past is Harry's name

365
00:24:15,436 --> 00:24:17,321
过去嘅唯一线索　就系帽入面哈利个名同地址
and address inside this hat.

366
00:24:17,356 --> 00:24:19,073
于是我跟住地址揾，就撞著你
So I made my way to the apartment

367
00:24:19,073 --> 00:24:20,791
于是我跟住地址揾，就撞著你
and that's when I found you.

368
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:23,463
胖丁胖丁
<i>♪Jigglypuff♪</i>

369
00:24:23,562 --> 00:24:24,929
﹣我唔清楚，可能哈利牵涉太深　　﹣牵涉啲咩？
I don't know. Maybe Harry got in too deep.

370
00:24:24,929 --> 00:24:26,296
﹣我唔清楚，可能哈利牵涉太深　　﹣牵涉啲咩？
Deep in what?

371
00:24:26,331 --> 00:24:28,382
遇著班坏人，诸如此类　当差好常见
You know, mixed up with the wrong crowd,

372
00:24:28,382 --> 00:24:30,434
遇著班坏人，诸如此类　当差好常见
that kinda thing. Happens to the best of us.

373
00:24:30,512 --> 00:24:32,764
债台高筑，走投无路
The debts pile up. The walls close in.

374
00:24:32,931 --> 00:24:35,475
白变黑，黑都系黑
Right becomes wrong. Wrong becomes wrong.

375
00:24:35,642 --> 00:24:37,102
﹣你打畀边个？　　﹣冇人
- Wait, who you calling?    - No one.

376
00:24:37,268 --> 00:24:39,979
听落唔错，份餐牌几好
Yeah, that sounds great. This menu looks really nice.

377
00:24:40,178 --> 00:24:41,695
我唔明，你仲听到其他人讲嘢？
Wait, I'm confused.

378
00:24:41,695 --> 00:24:43,213
我唔明，你仲听到其他人讲嘢？
Are you hearing other voices besides mine?

379
00:24:42,607 --> 00:24:44,776
我净系想知道　我点解听得明你
All I wanna know is why I can understand you.

380
00:24:44,516 --> 00:24:47,118
我帮你唔到　话咗我失忆，乜都记唔起
Ho! Can't help you there, kid.

381
00:24:47,118 --> 00:24:49,720
我帮你唔到　话咗我失忆，乜都记唔起
Like I said, I have amnesia. Can't remember a darn thing.

382
00:24:49,755 --> 00:24:51,422
所以你系只识讲嘢　但系失忆嘅Pikachu，仲有铺咖啡瘾
Okay, so you're a talking Pikachu

383
00:24:51,422 --> 00:24:53,090
所以你系只识讲嘢　但系失忆嘅Pikachu，仲有铺咖啡瘾
with no memories, who's addicted to caffeine.

384
00:24:53,368 --> 00:24:56,329
我饮唔饮都得，自己话事
I could stop whenever I want. These are just choices.

385
00:24:56,461 --> 00:24:57,962
整多杯，特浓，苦过廿四味　唔该，靓女
Another round. Extra shot.

386
00:24:57,962 --> 00:24:59,463
整多杯，特浓，苦过廿四味　唔该，靓女
Black as night. Thank you, sweetie.

387
00:24:59,249 --> 00:25:00,250
乐天河童！
Ludicolo!

388
00:25:00,732 --> 00:25:02,316
我系一流神探，不过冇咗记忆　就解唔开自己嘅谜团
Look, I'm a great detective.

389
00:25:02,316 --> 00:25:03,901
我系一流神探，不过冇咗记忆　就解唔开自己嘅谜团
But I can't solve my own mystery if I have no memory.

390
00:25:03,936 --> 00:25:05,970
﹣你点知自己系侦探？　　﹣我骨子里感觉到
Then how do you even know you're a detective?

391
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:08,005
﹣你点知自己系侦探？　　﹣我骨子里感觉到
Well, I can feel that in my jellies.

392
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,540
﹣咩骨？　　﹣就系骨子里啰，你明唔明？
What is that? What is that?

393
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:11,041
﹣咩骨？　　﹣就系骨子里啰，你明唔明？
It's the jellies. It's that thing, you know?

394
00:25:11,302 --> 00:25:13,972
有时所有人都话你错
You feel it when you really believe in something

395
00:25:14,139 --> 00:25:15,932
但系你好确定自己系啱
despite everyone telling you you're wrong.

396
00:25:16,148 --> 00:25:17,798
所以我要揾番哈利　佢系我过去嘅关键
Which is why I need to find Harry.

397
00:25:17,798 --> 00:25:19,449
所以我要揾番哈利　佢系我过去嘅关键
He's the key to my past.

398
00:25:19,477 --> 00:25:21,271
﹣乐天河童　　﹣唔该靓女
- Ludicolo.    - Thanks, doll.

399
00:25:21,438 --> 00:25:24,899
我有坏消息，哈利已经死咗
I got some bad news for you 'cause, uh, Harry's dead.

400
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:31,239
咩话？冇可能　哈利肯定未死
What? No. No, no, no. No, Harry ain't dead.

401
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:33,564
哈利死咗，你估错，对唔住　我亲眼见到警察份报告
No, Harry is dead. You're wrong. I'm sorry.

402
00:25:33,564 --> 00:25:35,699
哈利死咗，你估错，对唔住　我亲眼见到警察份报告
I saw in the police report that he's dead.

403
00:25:35,734 --> 00:25:37,134
﹣警察话佢死咗　　﹣即系法律上佢已经死亡
Just 'cause the cops say he's dead--

404
00:25:37,134 --> 00:25:38,535
﹣警察话佢死咗　　﹣即系法律上佢已经死亡
It means that he's legally dead.

405
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:40,707
系咩？有冇揾到尸体？
Really? Did they find a body?

406
00:25:42,042 --> 00:25:43,460
梗系冇
Oh, I didn't think so.

407
00:25:43,626 --> 00:25:46,546
份报告有冇话我都死咗？
And, by the way, did that report also say that I'm dead?

408
00:25:46,645 --> 00:25:47,957
因为我生猛到爆　所以哈利都未死，讲完
'Cause if I'm still alive and kicking,

409
00:25:47,957 --> 00:25:49,269
因为我生猛到爆　所以哈利都未死，讲完
that means Harry's out there, too.

410
00:25:49,269 --> 00:25:50,581
因为我生猛到爆　所以哈利都未死，讲完
Case closed.

411
00:25:50,616 --> 00:25:52,583
﹣但系件事未完，因为我要破案　　﹣好呀，我陪你玩，破咩案？
But still open until I solve it.

412
00:25:52,583 --> 00:25:54,551
﹣但系件事未完，因为我要破案　　﹣好呀，我陪你玩，破咩案？
Okay, I'll bite. Solve what?

413
00:25:54,586 --> 00:25:56,370
多谢你陪我玩，即系咁
Oh, I'm glad you're gonna bite.

414
00:25:56,370 --> 00:25:58,155
多谢你陪我玩，即系咁
All right. Here it is.

415
00:25:58,141 --> 00:26:00,352
哈利伪造自己死亡
Harry faked his own death.

416
00:26:00,518 --> 00:26:03,355
或者有人伪造佢嘅死亡
Or somebody else faked Harry's death.

417
00:26:03,521 --> 00:26:07,150
或者哈利伪造人哋死亡
Or Harry faked somebody else's death.

418
00:26:07,332 --> 00:26:09,467
最尾个猜测唔合理　但系头两个猜测几好
That last one doesn't work at all.

419
00:26:09,467 --> 00:26:11,602
最尾个猜测唔合理　但系头两个猜测几好
- No, it doesn't.    - The first two are contenders.

420
00:26:11,637 --> 00:26:13,154
﹣我走喇，我哋讲完　　﹣我哋未讲完
No, I'm gonna go. We're done here.

421
00:26:13,154 --> 00:26:14,671
﹣我走喇，我哋讲完　　﹣我哋未讲完
- No, we are not done here.    - This is…

422
00:26:14,616 --> 00:26:16,826
等阵，你去边呀？
Wait. Wait. Wait a minute. Where're you going?

423
00:26:16,993 --> 00:26:18,995
咪走住，我哋需要大家
Hold up a sec. We're gonna need each other.

424
00:26:19,162 --> 00:26:22,040
错晒！我唔需要Pokémon，讲完
No, we don't. I don't need a Pokemon. Period. Got it?

425
00:26:22,207 --> 00:26:23,792
世界一流神探呢？
Then what about a world-class detective?

426
00:26:23,958 --> 00:26:26,920
如果你想揾番老窦，我系最佳选择
Because if you wanna find your pops, I'm your best bet.

427
00:26:26,818 --> 00:26:28,152
世界一流神探应该一早知道
I think a world-class detective

428
00:26:28,152 --> 00:26:29,486
世界一流神探应该一早知道
oughta have figured out by now

429
00:26:29,589 --> 00:26:31,508
我唔系嚟揾我老窦
that I'm not here to find my father.

430
00:26:31,675 --> 00:26:33,385
我系嚟同佢道别
I'm here to say goodbye.

431
00:26:33,551 --> 00:26:36,096
唔使咁早道别住
Hey, hey. There's no one to say goodbye to.

432
00:26:36,304 --> 00:26:37,972
你谂谂，你可以同人类沟通
Look, you can talk to humans. I can talk to Pokemon.

433
00:26:38,139 --> 00:26:40,517
我就同Pokémon沟通　我哋彼此可以沟通
We can talk to each other.

434
00:26:40,684 --> 00:26:43,687
正常根本唔会发生　肯定有特别意义
This doesn't happen, kid. It has to mean something.

435
00:26:43,735 --> 00:26:46,504
有一种魔法令我哋一齐　系叫「希望」
There's magic that brought us together,

436
00:26:46,504 --> 00:26:49,273
有一种魔法令我哋一齐　系叫「希望」
and that magic is called hope.

437
00:26:50,694 --> 00:26:53,780
希望哈利仲在生
Hope that Harry is still alive.

438
00:26:58,284 --> 00:27:02,038
你骨子里都感觉到呢？
Oh, you feel it. You feel it in your jellies, don't you?

439
00:27:02,205 --> 00:27:03,707
我骨子里乜都冇
There's nothing in my jellies.

440
00:27:03,873 --> 00:27:06,626
我哋两个一定得
We're gonna do this. You and me.

441
00:27:09,379 --> 00:27:10,547
我唔敢相信⋯
I can't belie…

442
00:27:11,863 --> 00:27:13,814
﹣听朝喺度等　　﹣好
I will meet you here tomorrow morning.

443
00:27:13,814 --> 00:27:15,766
﹣听朝喺度等　　﹣好
Great.

444
00:27:15,885 --> 00:27:17,721
﹣你去边？　　﹣返我屋企
- Where're you going?    - To my apartment.

445
00:27:17,736 --> 00:27:19,003
﹣咩叫「你屋企」？　　﹣咩呀？
What do you mean, "Your apartment"?

446
00:27:19,003 --> 00:27:20,270
﹣咩叫「你屋企」？　　﹣咩呀？
What?

447
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:21,789
﹣好啦，畀张梳化你瞓　　﹣我唔要瞓梳化
All right, you can sleep on the couch.

448
00:27:21,789 --> 00:27:23,273
﹣好啦，畀张梳化你瞓　　﹣我唔要瞓梳化
No, I'm not gonna sleep on the couch.

449
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:25,059
一系瞓炉头啦　麻烦你开开门
Well, then you can sleep on the stove.

450
00:27:25,059 --> 00:27:26,810
一系瞓炉头啦　麻烦你开开门
Be a dear, would you, and get the door for me.

451
00:27:26,845 --> 00:27:28,045
﹣我到底做紧乜？　　﹣我竟然邀请人嚟过夜
What am I doing?

452
00:27:28,045 --> 00:27:29,246
﹣我到底做紧乜？　　﹣我竟然邀请人嚟过夜
I just invited

453
00:27:29,246 --> 00:27:30,447
﹣我到底做紧乜？　　﹣我竟然邀请人嚟过夜
someone to my apartment.

454
00:27:29,899 --> 00:27:32,944
我平时唔会咁　我唔系啲咁随便嘅Pokémon
I never do this. I'm not that kind of Pokemon.

455
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:38,973
周围铺满尘，但冇指纹
Dust everywhere.

456
00:27:38,973 --> 00:27:40,457
周围铺满尘，但冇指纹
No fingerprints.

457
00:27:41,619 --> 00:27:42,746
唔合理
Ugh. Doesn't add up.

458
00:27:43,361 --> 00:27:45,012
﹣你搞紧咩？　　﹣我揾紧过去嘅线索
What is going on in here?

459
00:27:45,012 --> 00:27:46,663
﹣你搞紧咩？　　﹣我揾紧过去嘅线索
I'm searching the joint, looking for clues.

460
00:27:46,791 --> 00:27:48,084
﹣呢间房你㗎？　　﹣唔系
- Is this your room?    - No.

461
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:50,000
﹣哈利有冇其他仔女？　　﹣冇
Does Harry have other children?

462
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,668
﹣哈利有冇其他仔女？　　﹣冇
No.

463
00:27:51,703 --> 00:27:53,704
我细个时，佢想我喺度住　所以布置到好似我细个间房咁
He wanted me to live here when I was a kid,

464
00:27:53,704 --> 00:27:55,706
我细个时，佢想我喺度住　所以布置到好似我细个间房咁
so he made it look like my childhood room.

465
00:27:55,741 --> 00:27:57,508
不如讨论吓　你细个瞓Pikachu床？
Should we talk about the fact

466
00:27:57,508 --> 00:27:59,276
不如讨论吓　你细个瞓Pikachu床？
that your childhood bed is a Pikachu bed?

467
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:00,221
咁啱啫
It's a coincidence.

468
00:28:00,378 --> 00:28:01,879
唔好意思，麻烦你大声讲　我听唔清楚
I'm sorry. Can you speak up?

469
00:28:01,879 --> 00:28:03,380
唔好意思，麻烦你大声讲　我听唔清楚
I can't hear you.

470
00:28:03,415 --> 00:28:04,832
我未试过　同时觉得荣幸同惊恐
I've never been so flattered

471
00:28:04,832 --> 00:28:06,249
我未试过　同时觉得荣幸同惊恐
and creeped out at the same time.

472
00:28:06,284 --> 00:28:07,701
﹣你会唔会将我整做灯罩？　　﹣可能会
Are you gonna make me into a lampshade?

473
00:28:07,701 --> 00:28:09,119
﹣你会唔会将我整做灯罩？　　﹣可能会
Oh, I might.

474
00:28:09,154 --> 00:28:10,888
咪住，咁多Pokémon卡　仲有对战海报⋯
Hang on, hang on, hang on.

475
00:28:10,888 --> 00:28:12,622
咪住，咁多Pokémon卡　仲有对战海报⋯
All these Pokemon cards and the battle posters…

476
00:28:12,692 --> 00:28:14,819
肯定有关系
There's a connection, isn't there?

477
00:28:14,986 --> 00:28:17,530
﹣你钟意Pokémon　　﹣唔系
- You love Pokemon.    - No.

478
00:28:17,697 --> 00:28:18,740
肯定系
Yeah. Yeah, you do.

479
00:28:19,097 --> 00:28:20,514
已经好耐以前　之后我阿爸搬咗入城
That was a long time ago,

480
00:28:20,514 --> 00:28:21,932
已经好耐以前　之后我阿爸搬咗入城
before my father moved to the city

481
00:28:21,993 --> 00:28:23,953
宁愿陪Pokémon　都唔陪自己个仔
and spent more time with Pokemon than his own son.

482
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,830
好呀，怪晒你老窦啦
Mmm, yeah, blame it on your dad.

483
00:28:26,071 --> 00:28:27,721
睇睇呢个人　一屋都系佢嘅相
Okay, look, what about this?

484
00:28:27,721 --> 00:28:29,372
睇睇呢个人　一屋都系佢嘅相
There's pictures of her all over the apartment.

485
00:28:29,407 --> 00:28:30,908
佢好明显同哈利有关系　可能会识我
She's obviously connected to Harry.

486
00:28:30,908 --> 00:28:32,409
佢好明显同哈利有关系　可能会识我
She might know me.

487
00:28:32,462 --> 00:28:33,755
可能系线索
She could be a lead.

488
00:28:33,922 --> 00:28:35,548
一定唔会
No, she's not.

489
00:28:36,591 --> 00:28:38,218
呢个系我妈妈
That's my mom.

490
00:28:38,385 --> 00:28:40,303
我11岁𠮶年佢已经过咗身
She passed away when I was 11.

491
00:28:41,346 --> 00:28:43,181
对唔住
Oh. I'm sorry. I…

492
00:28:43,431 --> 00:28:44,933
我唔知道
I didn't realize.

493
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,678
听朝我带你去揾吉田　睇吓揾唔揾到答案
Tomorrow morning I'm gonna take you to Yoshida

494
00:28:50,678 --> 00:28:52,596
听朝我带你去揾吉田　睇吓揾唔揾到答案
so we can get some answers.

495
00:29:21,511 --> 00:29:22,846
我啲线索！
Ahh, my clues!

496
00:29:23,295 --> 00:29:24,662
﹣呢啲咩嚟㗎？　　﹣我努力嘅成果
What is all this?

497
00:29:24,662 --> 00:29:26,029
﹣呢啲咩嚟㗎？　　﹣我努力嘅成果
Hard work. That's what this is.

498
00:29:26,064 --> 00:29:27,915
仲有，唔好揾警察　要先搞清楚边个信得过
And, by the way, we can't go to the cops.

499
00:29:27,915 --> 00:29:29,766
仲有，唔好揾警察　要先搞清楚边个信得过
Not till we know who we can trust.

500
00:29:29,853 --> 00:29:31,021
执返好我啲线索
So put my clues back in order, would you?

501
00:29:31,187 --> 00:29:33,356
呢啲唔叫线索，系连环杀手所为
These aren't clues. This is the work of a serial killer.

502
00:29:33,538 --> 00:29:34,722
﹣几乎系线索　　﹣咩意思？
They're almost clues.

503
00:29:34,722 --> 00:29:35,906
﹣几乎系线索　　﹣咩意思？
What does that even mean?

504
00:29:35,941 --> 00:29:37,708
我想触发记忆，谂番旧事　摊开晒会有帮助
Trying to jog my memory, retrace my steps.

505
00:29:37,708 --> 00:29:39,476
我想触发记忆，谂番旧事　摊开晒会有帮助
It helps me to see it all laid out.

506
00:29:39,511 --> 00:29:41,846
于是揾到佢　法国人会话系火热线索
That's how I found this.

507
00:29:41,846 --> 00:29:44,181
于是揾到佢　法国人会话系火热线索
This is what a Frenchman would call<i>caliente fiesta.</i>

508
00:29:44,075 --> 00:29:45,118
唔系法文
Not French.

509
00:29:45,317 --> 00:29:46,867
﹣闻我手指　　﹣我唔会闻你手指
Smell my finger.

510
00:29:46,867 --> 00:29:48,418
﹣闻我手指　　﹣我唔会闻你手指
I will never smell your finger.

511
00:29:48,413 --> 00:29:49,414
冇胆鬼
Coward.

512
00:29:49,754 --> 00:29:51,555
重点系寻晚袭击我哋班长尾怪手　身上有呢支R物质嘅味
The point is, I smelled this R stuff

513
00:29:51,555 --> 00:29:53,356
重点系寻晚袭击我哋班长尾怪手　身上有呢支R物质嘅味
on those Aipom when they attacked us yesterday.

514
00:29:53,376 --> 00:29:54,627
﹣R？　　﹣冇错！
- R?    - Bingo!

515
00:29:54,794 --> 00:29:56,254
大突破
<i>La Cucaracha.</i>

516
00:29:57,262 --> 00:29:59,730
哈利查嘅案件　应该有重大突破
See, I'm thinking Harry

517
00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:02,199
哈利查嘅案件　应该有重大突破
caught a break in the case,

518
00:30:02,234 --> 00:30:04,568
所以幕后黑手派人将佢灭口
forcing our shadowy kingpin

519
00:30:04,568 --> 00:30:06,903
所以幕后黑手派人将佢灭口
to send out hired goons to deliver the big hush-hush.

520
00:30:06,938 --> 00:30:08,439
我哋要追溯哈利嘅步伐　然后自己破案⋯
We need to retrace Harry's steps.

521
00:30:08,439 --> 00:30:09,940
我哋要追溯哈利嘅步伐　然后自己破案⋯
Either solve the case ourselves

522
00:30:09,975 --> 00:30:11,909
或者有足够进展逼大魔头现身
or get far enough along that this

523
00:30:11,909 --> 00:30:13,844
或者有足够进展逼大魔头现身
A-number-one bad guy has to reveal himself.

524
00:30:13,938 --> 00:30:15,857
﹣可能系女魔头　　﹣唔好再搞盏灯
- Or herself!    - Can you stop doing that?

525
00:30:16,024 --> 00:30:18,193
第一步应该点行？
So, what is the way in, huh?

526
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:19,903
答案就喺呢间房入面
The answer is in this room.

527
00:30:19,918 --> 00:30:22,553
呢间唔叫房，简直系火警高危区　周围都系垃圾废纸⋯
This isn't a room. This is a fire hazard.

528
00:30:22,553 --> 00:30:25,189
呢间唔叫房，简直系火警高危区　周围都系垃圾废纸⋯
It's just junk and papers and…

529
00:30:25,241 --> 00:30:26,826
（Pokémon巡游筹备）

530
00:30:27,410 --> 00:30:28,828
同报纸
Newspapers.

531
00:30:28,995 --> 00:30:30,246
你谂到咩？
What you got, kid?

532
00:30:30,562 --> 00:30:32,680
我最近识咗个人　佢喺CNM做初级记者
I literally just met someone.

533
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,798
我最近识咗个人　佢喺CNM做初级记者
She was a… She was a junior reporter at CNM.

534
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:37,084
佢调查紧哈利　应该有嘢隐瞒
She was doing a story on Harry.

535
00:30:37,084 --> 00:30:39,336
佢调查紧哈利　应该有嘢隐瞒
I think she knows more than she let on.

536
00:30:39,422 --> 00:30:41,174
聪明人通常都会隐瞒
The smart ones always do.

537
00:30:41,341 --> 00:30:43,259
我哋去佢公司，撬开佢把口
We gotta go down to her work and press her.

538
00:30:43,308 --> 00:30:44,708
﹣只系打个比喻　　﹣我知咩系比喻
- Okay.    - That's a metaphor.

539
00:30:44,708 --> 00:30:46,109
﹣只系打个比喻　　﹣我知咩系比喻
Yeah, I know what a metaphor is.

540
00:30:46,346 --> 00:30:47,430
我未饮完
Uh, I was drinking that.

541
00:30:47,712 --> 00:30:49,096
𠮶杯都未饮⋯随便踩啦　只不过系我毕生成就
I was also drink… Just step anywhere.

542
00:30:49,096 --> 00:30:50,480
𠮶杯都未饮⋯随便踩啦　只不过系我毕生成就
It's only my life's work.

543
00:30:50,475 --> 00:30:52,727
唔得，唔好爬上嚟
No. No, we're not doing that.

544
00:30:52,894 --> 00:30:54,270
算，我自己行
Fine, I'll walk.

545
00:30:54,437 --> 00:30:57,023
反正我想呢个钟头　行够十万步
I'm trying to get in 100,000 steps this hour.

546
00:30:59,257 --> 00:31:01,525
大家好，我系CNM总裁　兼克里佛企业主席罗杰克里佛
<i>Hello, I'm Roger Clifford, president of CNM</i>

00:31:05,746 --> 00:31:07,664
而我就系建立莱姆市嘅梦想家　霍华德克里佛
the visionary icon behind Ryme City.

550
00:31:07,659 --> 00:31:09,703
为咗宣扬和谐嘅精神
Together, in the spirit of harmony,

551
00:31:09,801 --> 00:31:11,524
我哋将会举办莱姆市史上　最大型嘅巡游，请勿错过
we're throwing the largest parade

552
00:31:11,524 --> 00:31:13,247

You won't wanna miss it.

今个周末，我哋邀请所有人
So, at the weekend, we invite the people…

庆祝人类同Pokémon和谐共处
A celebration of the harmony

557
00:31:21,295 --> 00:31:23,713
庆祝人类同Pokémon和谐共处
between humans and Pokemon.

558
00:31:23,758 --> 00:31:24,884
搞掂！
And, cut!

559
00:31:25,984 --> 00:31:27,334
﹣我觉得唔错　　﹣收声啦，老窦！
Well, I think that went rather well.

560
00:31:27,334 --> 00:31:28,685
﹣我觉得唔错　　﹣收声啦，老窦！
Oh, shut up, Dad!

561
00:31:28,763 --> 00:31:30,015
几好仔㖞
He seems nice.

562
00:31:30,088 --> 00:31:31,905
罗杰你咪咁啦　呢个系我哋送畀市民嘅礼物

罗杰你咪咁啦　呢个系我哋送畀市民嘅礼物
our gift to the citizens.

564
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:35,812
梦想家？你系咪讲笑？
"Visionary icon"? Really?

565
00:31:35,979 --> 00:31:38,023
不如直接叫「救世主」啦？
Was "savior of the world" taken?

566
00:31:38,189 --> 00:31:40,483
份稿系你啲人写㗎
It was your people who wrote the promo, son.

567
00:31:40,632 --> 00:31:42,583
系咪有份完整版　讲你点医好癌症？
Oh, is there an unabridged version

568
00:31:42,583 --> 00:31:44,534
系咪有份完整版　讲你点医好癌症？
where you cure cancer?

好呀，转身走啰　你次次都系咁
Oh, that's right, yeah.

570
00:31:46,103 --> 00:31:47,637
好呀，转身走啰　你次次都系咁
Turn your back on me like you always did.

571
00:31:47,672 --> 00:31:49,156
﹣百变怪！　　﹣根本冇人钟意你只Pokémon！
Ditto!

572
00:31:49,156 --> 00:31:50,640
﹣百变怪！　　﹣根本冇人钟意你只Pokémon！
By the way, no one likes your Pokemon!

573
00:31:50,618 --> 00:31:51,619
佢喺𠮶边
There she is.

574
00:31:53,345 --> 00:31:55,513
﹣我明白你点解咁兴奋　　﹣我冇兴奋
I can see why you were so excited.

575
00:31:55,513 --> 00:31:57,681
﹣我明白你点解咁兴奋　　﹣我冇兴奋
I was… Okay, I was not that excited.

576

克里佛先生！克里佛先生！
Mr. Clifford! Mr. Clifford!

克里佛先生，我可能有大新闻
Mr. Clifford, I may have a story for you.

我听讲有Pokémon攻击人类　但系主流媒体冇报导
I've heard rumors of Pokemon attacking people.

579
00:32:03,921 --> 00:32:05,922
我听讲有Pokémon攻击人类　但系主流媒体冇报导
But there's been no mainstream coverage.

580
00:32:05,967 --> 00:32:07,761
唔好意思，我哋唔系八卦杂志
I'm sorry, we're not a tabloid.

581
00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:10,344
唔会报导呢啲　冇根据嘅流言蜚语
Which means that we don't report

582
00:32:10,344 --> 00:32:12,829
唔会报导呢啲　冇根据嘅流言蜚语
on rumors, gossip or hearsay.

583
00:32:12,891 --> 00:32:15,560
确认唔到嘅就唔系新闻
It's not news if it can't be verified.

584
00:32:15,727 --> 00:32:19,397
你要报导新闻　就要揾可靠嘅料
You want a story, find a source.

585

著衫要著得好好睇睇
A reasonable sense of fashion.

佢行过嚟，整返个深奥嘅款
Here she comes. Try to look deep.

589
00:32:39,125 --> 00:32:40,669
你点会喺度？
What are you doing here?

590
00:32:40,835 --> 00:32:42,128
我哋又见面
Hey, again. Uh…

591
00:32:42,394 --> 00:32:44,094
我知道有啲怪　但系我有问题要妳解答
Yeah, I know this seems weird

592
00:32:44,094 --> 00:32:45,795
我知道有啲怪　但系我有问题要妳解答
but I actually needed to ask you something.

593
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,676
我而家唔系好方便
Now's not really a good time.

594
00:32:47,842 --> 00:32:50,762
我都有见到，唔好意思
Yeah, I saw that. I'm sorry.

595
00:32:56,017 --> 00:32:57,936
对唔住，杯嘢好热
Sorry. It's piping hot.

你揾到Pokémon做你拍档
You found yourself a Pokemon partner.

597
00:33:01,356 --> 00:33:02,691
唔算系

598
00:33:02,857 --> 00:33:03,858
佢好得意
He's cute.

599
00:33:04,025 --> 00:33:06,361
佢想色诱我，但系唔使担心　我定力十足⋯
She's trying to work me, kid. But, trust me, I can…

600
00:33:06,528 --> 00:33:09,239
救命，好舒服
Oh, sweet Mother of Arceus, that feels so good.

601
00:33:09,406 --> 00:33:11,408
﹣即系咁⋯　　﹣舒服死我
- So, listen…    - Oh, my God.

602
00:33:11,574 --> 00:33:12,575
发生咩事？
What happened?

603
00:33:12,957 --> 00:33:14,858
我喺哈利书台揾到呢支嘢　差啲搞到我窒息，我⋯
I found something in Harry's desk,

604
00:33:14,858 --> 00:33:16,760
我喺哈利书台揾到呢支嘢　差啲搞到我窒息，我⋯
nearly choked me to death, and I was--

605
00:33:16,871 --> 00:33:17,872
隔墙有耳
No, not here.

606
00:33:19,833 --> 00:33:21,167
去我办公室倾
In my office.

607
00:33:22,544 --> 00:33:24,963
去佢办公室？　我哋要去佢办公室？
In her office? We're going to her office?

608
00:33:27,382 --> 00:33:28,925
好地方吖
This is great.

609
00:33:29,092 --> 00:33:32,012
呢个唔叫办公室　叫摆咗铅笔嘅棺材
This isn't an office. It's a coffin with pencils.

610
00:33:32,178 --> 00:33:33,179
可达？
Psyduck?

611
00:33:33,711 --> 00:33:34,978
冇错，佢听得明我　我听得明佢，我哋天赋异禀
Yeah, that's right. I can talk to the kid,

612
00:33:34,978 --> 00:33:36,246
冇错，佢听得明我　我听得明佢，我哋天赋异禀
he can talk to me. We're gifted.

613
00:33:36,281 --> 00:33:38,515
你冇话我知佢有可达鸭　佢哋压力太大就爆炸
You didn't tell me that she has a Psyduck.

614
00:33:38,515 --> 00:33:40,750
你冇话我知佢有可达鸭　佢哋压力太大就爆炸
These things explode when they're stressed.

615
00:33:40,770 --> 00:33:42,230
冷静啲
Hey. Hey, keep calm, pal.

616
00:33:42,397 --> 00:33:44,649
冇事嘅，冇事嘅
Serenity now. Serenity now.

617
00:33:45,483 --> 00:33:46,484
唔喺度
- No.    - Okay.

618
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:49,025
Okay.

619
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:50,822
﹣揾到？　　﹣喺度
- You got it?    - Here it is.

620
00:33:54,784 --> 00:33:55,910
妳点揾到㗎？
Where did you find these?

621
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:57,568
听讲哈利喺码头有个线人
Word on the street was that

622
00:33:57,568 --> 00:33:59,102
听讲哈利喺码头有个线人
Harry had an informant near the docks.

623
00:33:59,137 --> 00:34:01,038
我去咗调查　之后就揾到啲樽仔
I went there to snoop around,

624
00:34:01,038 --> 00:34:02,939
我去咗调查　之后就揾到啲樽仔
and that's where I found the vial.

625
00:34:03,001 --> 00:34:05,003
但系码头好危险
But the docks can be dangerous.

626
00:34:05,643 --> 00:34:07,444
唔适合夜妈妈一个人去
It's not the sort of place

627
00:34:07,444 --> 00:34:09,245
唔适合夜妈妈一个人去
you want to visit alone at night.

628
00:34:09,382 --> 00:34:11,634
我夜晚一个人出街都好掂
I'm actually pretty good at being alone at night.

629
00:34:13,261 --> 00:34:15,347
完全捉错用神
Nope, that did not land right at all.

630
00:34:16,473 --> 00:34:19,559
我唔系咁嘅意思
That's not… That's not what I meant to say. Um…

631
00:34:20,352 --> 00:34:22,103
﹣唔紧要　　﹣我都系⋯

00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:23,813
我哋走先
We should go.

633
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:26,149
﹣早走早著　　﹣我会侧侧身出去
- Yeah, we should go.    - I'm just gonna scoot by ya.

634
00:34:26,316 --> 00:34:28,651
你系咪成世人未沟过女？
Good God, have you ever talked to a woman before?

635
00:34:28,818 --> 00:34:30,862
﹣你背脊⋯　　﹣可达
- You've got some…    - Psyduck.

636
00:34:31,029 --> 00:34:32,864
我沟过女，唔使你帮
Yes, I've talked women before. No, I don't need your help.

637
00:34:33,031 --> 00:34:35,116
出世𠮶阵沟护士？
Was it during the birth canal, or…

638
00:34:40,145 --> 00:34:41,745
知唔知你需要咩？　一个肩鞍，肯定有得淘
You know what you need?

639
00:34:41,745 --> 00:34:43,346
知唔知你需要咩？　一个肩鞍，肯定有得淘
A shoulder saddle. I bet someone makes one.

640
00:34:43,381 --> 00:34:44,965
你实有其他办法走动　家阵我好样衰
Okay. There are other ways for you to get around.

641
00:34:44,965 --> 00:34:46,549
你实有其他办法走动　家阵我好样衰
This is humiliating.

642
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:47,901
你一步等于我一千步　我个肺提子咁细粒
Every step for you is 1000 for me,

643
00:34:47,901 --> 00:34:49,219
你一步等于我一千步　我个肺提子咁细粒
and my lungs are the size of grapes.

644
00:34:49,254 --> 00:34:50,487
我哋做拍档　首先要约法三章
We need to get some ground rules

645
00:34:50,487 --> 00:34:51,721
我哋做拍档　首先要约法三章
if this partnership's gonna work.

646
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:53,140
﹣你唔系我拍档　　﹣导师、师傅、良师益友
You're not my partner.

647
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:54,524
﹣你唔系我拍档　　﹣导师、师傅、良师益友
Mentor,<i>sensei,</i>master,

648
00:34:54,427 --> 00:34:56,137
﹣任你拣　　﹣全部都唔系
whatever you wanna call it.

649
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,110
可能唔系啲气体？　或者系遗传
Nope, none of those.

650
00:34:57,110 --> 00:34:58,661
可能唔系啲气体？　或者系遗传
Hey, what if it wasn't the gas? What if it's hereditary?

651
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:01,184
可能哈利都听得明你把麻烦声
What if Harry could understand your annoying voice, too?

652
00:35:01,266 --> 00:35:03,317
你唔讲出口我哋都明　我感应到你想讲咩
You don't need to talk to us for us to understand.

653
00:35:03,317 --> 00:35:05,368
你唔讲出口我哋都明　我感应到你想讲咩
We can feel what you're saying.

654
00:35:05,438 --> 00:35:08,149
你要抛开成见，多啲尝试
You have to be open to the experience. Try it sometime.

655
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:09,739
唔使客气，同你讲嘢已经够烦
Yeah, I'd rather not.

656
00:35:09,739 --> 00:35:11,040
唔使客气，同你讲嘢已经够烦
I got my plate full talking to you.

657
00:35:12,278 --> 00:35:13,363
系咩嚟？
What is that?

658
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:15,128
无声臭屁，唔好意思　我饮得太多咖啡，搞肚痛
Silent but deadly.

659
00:35:15,128 --> 00:35:16,646
无声臭屁，唔好意思　我饮得太多咖啡，搞肚痛
Apologies, my tummy's bad from all the coffee.

660
00:35:16,616 --> 00:35:18,034
好核突，快啲落地
No. Ew. Get off.

661
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,161
我讲佢
I meant that.

662
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:22,619
Oh. Ooh. Ugh.

663
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:23,748
佢？
That.

664
00:35:23,915 --> 00:35:26,126
系魔墙人偶，我至憎佢哋
It's a Mr. Mime. They're the worst.

665
00:35:26,668 --> 00:35:28,253
粒声唔出，但系烦到死
Silent but annoying.

666
00:35:29,754 --> 00:35:32,257
佢系咪认得你？　佢好似认得你
Does he recognize you? I think he recognizes you.

667
00:35:32,424 --> 00:35:34,843
我系哈利拍档　可能同佢交过手
Well, I was Harry's partner, so I would've been with him.

668
00:35:36,219 --> 00:35:38,304
哈利个线人系Pokémon！
Harry's informant is a Pokemon!

669
00:35:38,471 --> 00:35:39,472
捉住佢！
Get him!

670
00:35:45,395 --> 00:35:47,480
﹣佢根本都冇跑　　﹣唔好话佢听
- He's barely moving.    - Don't tell him that.

671
00:35:47,939 --> 00:35:49,024
佢踩电单车走喇
Oh! He's on a bike.

672
00:35:49,247 --> 00:35:50,614
佢以为自己走得甩　走去佢前面
Come on! He thinks he's getting away.

673
00:35:50,614 --> 00:35:51,981
佢以为自己走得甩　走去佢前面
Look, quick! Get in front of him.

674
00:35:52,027 --> 00:35:53,528
﹣截停佢，你得嘅　　﹣停呀
- Cut him off. You can make it.    - Stop.

675
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:56,420
大剂，佢撞得好应
Oh, no.

676
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:58,855
大剂，佢撞得好应
He's going down hard, Tim.

677
00:35:58,908 --> 00:36:00,326
鬼叫佢唔戴头盔
Should've worn a helmet.

678
00:36:00,952 --> 00:36:02,037
希望佢大步槛过
I hope he makes it.

679
00:36:02,203 --> 00:36:03,872
够喇，咪玩
Come on. This is ridiculous.

680
00:36:04,562 --> 00:36:05,862
﹣我哋扮警探，我忠你奸　　﹣我哋唔系警探
I'm good cop, you're bad cop.

00:36:05,862 --> 00:36:07,163
﹣我哋扮警探，我忠你奸　　﹣我哋唔系警探
We're not cops.

682
00:36:07,198 --> 00:36:08,482
大胆啲啦，你大只过我　唔打得都睇得
Grow some berries.

683
00:36:08,482 --> 00:36:09,766
大胆啲啦，你大只过我　唔打得都睇得
You're bigger and tougher looking than I am.

684
00:36:09,794 --> 00:36:11,004
企直啲
Stand up straight!

685
00:36:11,369 --> 00:36:12,819
听住，我哋有办法　令你开声或者做手势
Listen up.

686
00:36:12,819 --> 00:36:14,270
听住，我哋有办法　令你开声或者做手势
We got ways to make you talk. Or mime.

687
00:36:14,305 --> 00:36:15,555
﹣冇错　　﹣快啲爆料
Yeah.

688
00:36:15,555 --> 00:36:16,806
﹣冇错　　﹣快啲爆料
So tell us what we wanna know.

689
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:18,425
哈利古德曼点解会嚟呢度？　同R有咩关系？
Why was Harry Goodman here

690
00:36:18,425 --> 00:36:20,010
哈利古德曼点解会嚟呢度？　同R有咩关系？
and what did it have to do with the R?

691
00:36:21,264 --> 00:36:22,640
管，罐！
Pipe. Yes, okay. A can!

692
00:36:23,391 --> 00:36:24,851
撞？推？
Shoving. Pushing.

693
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:26,383
我问题系我拒人千里　之后又唔想人走
My problem is that I push people away

694
00:36:26,383 --> 00:36:27,750
我问题系我拒人千里　之后又唔想人走
and then hate them for leaving.

695
00:36:27,479 --> 00:36:29,856
﹣佢叫你折埋　　﹣咩话？叫我折埋？
- He's saying you can shove it.    - What? I can shove it?

696
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:31,455
够喇！我哋调转角色　我做奸探，你做忠探
Okay, that's it. We're switching roles.

够喇！我哋调转角色　我做奸探，你做忠探
I'm bad cop, you're good cop.

698

我哋唔系警探！
- No, no, no, we're not cops!    - Oh!

699
00:36:34,402 --> 00:36:35,987
救命，撞到应
Oh, God, that's a very hard wall.

700
00:36:36,094 --> 00:36:37,895
系㖞，魔墙人偶识整透明力墙
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, Mr. Mime has the ability

701
00:36:37,895 --> 00:36:39,696
系㖞，魔墙人偶识整透明力墙
to make invisible walls.

702
00:36:40,033 --> 00:36:42,369
我知呀，我都系Pokémon　你唔记得咗？
Uh, yes, I know. I happen to be a Pokemon, too, remember?

703
00:36:43,453 --> 00:36:45,663
哈利谂到办法套佢口供
Look, Harry figured this guy out somehow.

704
00:36:46,331 --> 00:36:48,875
应该系靠心理战
I think the trick is getting inside his head.

705
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:51,336
我有个主意
I have an idea.

706
00:36:53,254 --> 00:36:54,547
你想点？
What are you doing?

707
00:36:55,882 --> 00:36:56,966
咩事？
Oh, what's this?

708
00:36:57,148 --> 00:36:58,582
原来有度门，隐咗形我冇见到
Oh, there's a door there. I didn't…

709
00:36:58,582 --> 00:37:00,016
原来有度门，隐咗形我冇见到
Probably because it's invisible.

710
00:37:00,261 --> 00:37:02,639
冇错，而家我入咗你空间
Huh? Yeah! I'm in your space now, am I right?

711
00:37:02,806 --> 00:37:04,766
系咪觉得好唔舒服？
You don't like this so much, do you?

712
00:37:04,933 --> 00:37:06,351
你搞乜？
What are you doing?

713
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:09,020
拎住个水壶，倒紧水
That's a jug. No, you're pouring.

714
00:37:09,187 --> 00:37:10,021
唔系
No.

715
00:37:10,188 --> 00:37:11,856
系盐，你拎住罐盐煮𩠌
Salt. It's a salt shaker. You're cooking.

716
00:37:11,963 --> 00:37:13,113
真厨艺系由心出发，唔靠食谱
- No.    - Real cooking is about

717
00:37:13,113 --> 00:37:14,264
真厨艺系由心出发，唔靠食谱
following your heart, not a recipe!

718
00:37:13,983 --> 00:37:15,568
你讲乜呀？
What are you talking about?

719
00:37:15,735 --> 00:37:17,987
汽油，你倒紧汽油
Gas. You're pouring gasoline on…

720
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:20,782
哗，即刻好黑暗
- Mmm-hmm.    - Oh, that went dark fast.

721
00:37:20,949 --> 00:37:23,118
我钟意，我好钟意
I like this. I like this very much.

722
00:37:25,036 --> 00:37:26,371
好呀，好呀
All right, all right.

723
00:37:28,179 --> 00:37:29,913
你想玩游戏，我同你玩
Okay. You wanna play that game?

724
00:37:29,913 --> 00:37:31,648
你想玩游戏，我同你玩
I can play that game.

725
00:37:33,962 --> 00:37:35,422
你觉得好笑咩？
You think that's funny?

726
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,507
你系咪觉得好好笑？
You think that's funny, huh?

727
00:37:37,674 --> 00:37:40,135
睇你笑得几耐
You're not gonna be laughing soon, huh?

728
00:37:40,719 --> 00:37:42,053
而家仲笑唔笑得出？
Who's laughing now, huh?

729
00:37:43,263 --> 00:37:46,016
我明你想点
Oh. Oh, I smell what you're stepping in.

730
00:37:46,182 --> 00:37:47,517
冇错，魔墙人偶
That's right, Mr. Mime.

731
00:37:47,465 --> 00:37:49,399
你唔快啲爆料　因住变脆香人偶
You're about to be Mr. Melt

732
00:37:49,399 --> 00:37:51,334
你唔快啲爆料　因住变脆香人偶
unless you start talking.

733
00:37:52,731 --> 00:37:54,774
卡，啤牌、扑克
Cards, cards. Playing cards. Poker.

734
00:37:54,941 --> 00:37:56,192
应该系讲紧R
No, I think he's talking about the R.

735
00:37:56,651 --> 00:37:58,194
有人周围派R
Someone was handing out R.

736
00:37:58,361 --> 00:37:59,612
手势清楚啲，边度？
Use your body words. Where?

737
00:38:00,321 --> 00:38:02,282
圆形屋、月亮屋、月亮、屋
Circle house. Moon house. Moon. House.

738
00:38:02,449 --> 00:38:04,159
玩够喇，讲啦
Enough with the games. Say it.

739
00:38:04,325 --> 00:38:05,326
开口讲啦
Just say it!

740
00:38:05,493 --> 00:38:06,911
开声讲呀，蠢材！
Talk, you stupid mime!

741
00:38:07,078 --> 00:38:08,872
冷静啲
Okay, just relax.

742
00:38:09,831 --> 00:38:10,957
圆
Uh, round.

743
00:38:11,124 --> 00:38:12,292
圆形屋
Round house. Uh…

744
00:38:12,459 --> 00:38:14,419
啲R系来自圆屋！
The source of the R came from the Roundhouse.

745
00:38:14,425 --> 00:38:16,109
唔错，睇嚟你有啲侦探天分
Yeah, nice work, kid. Maybe there's

746
00:38:16,109 --> 00:38:17,794
唔错，睇嚟你有啲侦探天分
a little detective in you after all.

747
00:38:34,481 --> 00:38:38,860
击中要害！额外伤害！
Critical hit! Additional damage!

748
00:38:44,783 --> 00:38:46,201
（加农水炮！）

749
00:38:51,164 --> 00:38:53,500
我以为莱姆市冇Pokémon对战
I didn't know they had Pokemon battles in Ryme City.

750
00:38:53,667 --> 00:38:54,709
系唔应该有㗎
We're not supposed to.

751
00:38:57,212 --> 00:38:59,631
耿鬼使出暗影球！
Gengar uses Shadow Ball!

752
00:39:10,725 --> 00:39:12,227
嚟啦，我哋周围睇睇
Come on. Let's take a look around.

753
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:17,774
（个细路嚟咗，仲带埋Pikachu）

754
00:39:17,941 --> 00:39:19,943
我哋总结一吓案情
Okay, kid. So here's what we know.

755
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:21,986
哈利追寻R到呢度
Harry traces the R to here.

756
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,527
之后佢成日嚟　因为呢度某人知道某啲嘢
Then frequents this joint because someone

757
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:24,894
之后佢成日嚟　因为呢度某人知道某啲嘢
here knows something about something.

758
00:39:24,989 --> 00:39:27,992
我哋只要揾出𠮶个人，同𠮶啲嘢
We just need to find the someone and the something.

759
00:39:28,159 --> 00:39:32,205
𠮶只Pikachu个拍档呢？唔好走
Hey, hey! Where's that Pikachu's partner? Don't go.

760
00:39:32,539 --> 00:39:34,249
照我睇　系我哋畀人揾到
I think the "someone" just found us.

761
00:39:34,572 --> 00:39:36,039
我想知佢上啲咩网
Wow. I'd like to see

762
00:39:36,039 --> 00:39:37,507
我想知佢上啲咩网
this guy's Internet search history.

763
00:39:37,502 --> 00:39:38,503
你系边个？
Who are you?

764
00:39:38,776 --> 00:39:39,943
顺水推舟，话你系我新拍档
Let's see where this goes.

765
00:39:39,943 --> 00:39:41,110
顺水推舟，话你系我新拍档
Tell him you're my new partner.

766
00:39:41,131 --> 00:39:42,966
我系佢新拍档
I'm his new partner.

767
00:39:43,133 --> 00:39:44,968
𠮶只Pikachu招十万伏特
Well, that Pikachu's Thunderbolt

768
00:39:45,149 --> 00:39:47,350
上次差啲打残我只宝贝喷火龙
almost wrecked my prize Charizard

769
00:39:47,350 --> 00:39:49,552
上次差啲打残我只宝贝喷火龙
- last time he was here.    - Oh.

770
00:39:50,432 --> 00:39:51,975
伤痕仲未退
Scar is still fresh.

771
00:39:52,142 --> 00:39:55,562
我只系睇到两块大胸肌　一个字都冇听到
All I hear are consonants, and all I see are nipples.

772
00:39:55,729 --> 00:39:57,105
你知嘛？
And you know what?

773
00:39:57,814 --> 00:39:59,983
佢整烂咗我件外套，你睇
He ruined my coat, man. Look at this.

774
00:40:00,164 --> 00:40:01,631
﹣唔好意思　　﹣毋理外套，佢点解唔著衫？
I'm so sorry.

775
00:40:01,631 --> 00:40:03,099
﹣唔好意思　　﹣毋理外套，佢点解唔著衫？
Forget the coat. Where's his shirt?

776
00:40:03,153 --> 00:40:05,572
呢度系我地头！
This! This is my place!

777
00:40:06,031 --> 00:40:08,033
冇人可以踩入我地头
And nobody comes into my place

778
00:40:08,616 --> 00:40:10,577
咁样对我嘅Pokémon
and does that to my Pokemon.

779
00:40:10,744 --> 00:40:11,828
你望咩呀？
What are you looking at?

780
00:40:11,995 --> 00:40:13,580
仲有我件外套
Or to my coat.

781
00:40:13,747 --> 00:40:15,498
系㖞，外套
Right, the coat. The coat.

782
00:40:15,665 --> 00:40:16,666
你做乜呀？
What are you doing?

783
00:40:16,833 --> 00:40:18,877
同佢互睥，眨眼先就输
Classic staredown, kid. First one to blink loses.

784
00:40:19,044 --> 00:40:20,462
咪再骚扰我
Now stop distracting me.

785
00:40:20,184 --> 00:40:22,168
我只系想知佢旧拍档　点解会嚟呢度
Er, look, I just wanna know

786
00:40:22,168 --> 00:40:24,153
我只系想知佢旧拍档　点解会嚟呢度
why his old partner was here. That's all.

787
00:40:24,215 --> 00:40:26,217
耿鬼胜
Gengar wins.

788
00:40:26,801 --> 00:40:28,887
预备下场对战
Ready for next battle.

789
00:40:29,721 --> 00:40:31,514
我要重赛
And I want a rematch.

790
00:40:32,057 --> 00:40:33,600
你肯同我重赛
You give me my rematch…

791
00:40:35,268 --> 00:40:37,479
我就话晒我知嘅嘢你听
I'll tell you everything you want to know. What I know.

792
00:40:39,397 --> 00:40:41,232
同佢讲冇问题，老友
- Er…    - Tell him he's on,<i>amigo.</i>

793
00:40:41,983 --> 00:40:42,984
好
Okay.

794
00:40:43,318 --> 00:40:45,278
下场对战即将开始
A new battle's unfolding.

795
00:40:45,445 --> 00:40:48,114
Pikachu大战喷火龙
Pikachu versus Charizard.

796
00:40:48,573 --> 00:40:49,824
重赛！
Rematch!

797
00:40:53,578 --> 00:40:55,580
帮我拎住顶帽
Here. Hold my hat.

798
00:40:55,747 --> 00:40:57,165
预备睇我表演
I'm about to rock this place.

799
00:40:57,332 --> 00:40:59,292
﹣好　　﹣喷火龙！喷火龙！
- Okay.    - Charizard! Charizard!

800
00:40:59,323 --> 00:41:00,907
拉拉筋先，费事阵间抽筋
Just doing some light stretching.

801
00:41:00,907 --> 00:41:02,492
拉拉筋先，费事阵间抽筋
You never wanna go into these things tight.

802
00:41:02,629 --> 00:41:04,255
你今次一定要赢
You're gonna win this time, okay?

803
00:41:04,798 --> 00:41:06,966
你做咩？打算点攻击？
What are you doing? What is your plan of attack?

804
00:41:07,198 --> 00:41:09,199
我冇乜打算，一切随机应变
I don't operate according to plans, kid.

805
00:41:09,199 --> 00:41:11,200
我冇乜打算，一切随机应变
I deal with things in the moment.

806
00:41:12,847 --> 00:41:16,643
嚟，索一索，然后落场
Here. Here we go. Now you'll be ready.

807
00:41:19,521 --> 00:41:22,816
好明显，我收拾过呢只蠢嘢
Now, obviously, I've dealt with this putz before,

808
00:41:22,982 --> 00:41:24,567
我会将案件重演
so I'll just do it again.

809
00:41:25,985 --> 00:41:27,112
畀返顶帽我！
Give me my hat back!

810
00:41:27,418 --> 00:41:28,935
𠮶只嘢队咗劲大支R物质！
That thing just chugged

811
00:41:28,935 --> 00:41:30,453
𠮶只嘢队咗劲大支R物质！
a year's worth of that R stuff!

812
00:41:30,532 --> 00:41:32,659
你头先都话过
Hey, hey, hey. It's like you said, okay?

813
00:41:32,924 --> 00:41:34,241
你之前赢过一次　出绝招打佢就得
You did it before.

814
00:41:34,241 --> 00:41:35,558
你之前赢过一次　出绝招打佢就得
You just gotta use your powers.

815
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:38,206
你可以用电光一闪　放电或者电球⋯
You can use Quick Attack, Discharge, or Electro Ball,

816
00:41:38,362 --> 00:41:39,829
但系伏特攻击最适合　用𠮶招先啦
but I think Volt Tackle

817
00:41:39,829 --> 00:41:41,297
但系伏特攻击最适合　用𠮶招先啦
is your best move, so start with that.

818
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:42,849
首先，你几时学识做Pokémon训练员？
First of all,

819
00:41:42,849 --> 00:41:44,367
首先，你几时学识做Pokémon训练员？
when did you learn how to be a Pokemon Trainer?

820
00:41:44,045 --> 00:41:46,089
第二，快啲放我出去！
And secondly, get me the hell out of here!

821
00:41:46,256 --> 00:41:47,257
开战！
Begin!

822
00:41:49,676 --> 00:41:51,094
﹣小心！　　﹣死喇⋯
- Look out!    - Whoa, whoa, whoa!

823
00:41:51,261 --> 00:41:52,637
我已经唔记得你讲过咩！
I forgot everything you said!

824
00:41:52,804 --> 00:41:54,806
我有失忆症，记性好差！
I forget things, it's what I do! I have amnesia!

825
00:41:54,973 --> 00:41:57,058
你要击中要害，用伏特攻击！
You need to go for a critical hit. Use Volt Tackle!

826
00:41:57,225 --> 00:41:59,978
伏特攻击会两败俱伤　我都系用十万伏特
Volt Tackle will knock me out. I'm going for Thunderbolt.

827
00:42:01,354 --> 00:42:02,981
好，你得㗎！
Come on. You got it, you got it!

828
00:42:12,449 --> 00:42:13,950
快啲啦⋯
Come on, come on, come on.

829
00:42:14,242 --> 00:42:15,994
老友，你见点呀？
Hey, bud! What are you doing?

830
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,251
有人睇住，我出唔到电！　大家不如拧转面？
I can't do it when people are watching.

831
00:42:18,251 --> 00:42:20,303
有人睇住，我出唔到电！　大家不如拧转面？
Can everyone just look away, please?

832
00:42:20,338 --> 00:42:22,255
唔得，我唔记得咗点出招
It's not working.

833
00:42:22,255 --> 00:42:24,173
唔得，我唔记得咗点出招
I forgot how to use my powers.

834
00:42:26,838 --> 00:42:27,839
但系佢记得！
But he didn't!

835
00:42:32,719 --> 00:42:33,762
Pikachu，走呀！
Pikachu, run!

836
00:42:33,928 --> 00:42:35,347
死喇⋯
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

837
00:42:42,729 --> 00:42:44,522
一招就打到飞起！
Taken out with one hit!

838
00:42:44,689 --> 00:42:46,566
哎呀，Pikachu，系咪想喊？
Aw, Pikachu. Wanna cry?

839
00:42:51,071 --> 00:42:53,365
你唔会咁做，我咁可爱！
You don't wanna do this! I'm adorable.

840
00:42:53,948 --> 00:42:55,408
Pika﹣Pika？
Pika-Pika?

841
00:43:05,377 --> 00:43:07,462
你癫咗？快啲出嚟！
Are you crazy? Get out of there!

842
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:10,924
等我出招！
I got it, kid!

843
00:43:21,476 --> 00:43:23,520
你想对我宝贝做咩呀？
What are you doing to my baby?

844
00:43:23,687 --> 00:43:25,563
﹣行开呀！　　﹣弊
- Get out of the way!    - Uh-oh.

845
00:43:34,531 --> 00:43:35,615
今次大镬
Uh-oh. That's not good.

846
00:44:11,026 --> 00:44:12,152
快啲爆料！
Tell me what you know!

847
00:44:12,516 --> 00:44:14,801
你哋揾𠮶个人　想查出R嘅来源
The guy you are looking for

848
00:44:14,801 --> 00:44:17,086
你哋揾𠮶个人　想查出R嘅来源
wanted to know the source of R.

849
00:44:17,121 --> 00:44:18,422
R嚟自博士　我净系知咁多，放我走！
It comes from the doctor.

850
00:44:18,422 --> 00:44:19,723
R嚟自博士　我净系知咁多，放我走！
That's all I know.

851
00:44:19,723 --> 00:44:21,024
R嚟自博士　我净系知咁多，放我走！
Now let me go!

852
00:44:35,425 --> 00:44:37,218
接得好，我哋要离开呢度
Nice catch, kid. Let's get out of here.

853
00:44:42,265 --> 00:44:43,266
我有个计划
I got a plan.

854
00:44:43,641 --> 00:44:45,769
搞咩？咪玩啦，鲤鱼王冇鬼用
What? That's not gonna work. Magikarp is the worst.

855
00:44:45,816 --> 00:44:47,417
鲤鱼王一进化就系暴鲤龙　只需要踢佢一踢
Magikarp can evolve into Gyarados.

856
00:44:47,417 --> 00:44:49,018
鲤鱼王一进化就系暴鲤龙　只需要踢佢一踢
All it needs is a little kick.

857
00:44:48,938 --> 00:44:50,023
嚟啦！
Water in the hole!

858
00:44:53,735 --> 00:44:55,403
我脑入面个结果唔系咁
In my head, I saw that differently.

859
00:44:55,493 --> 00:44:57,894
Er…

860
00:45:11,878 --> 00:45:13,672
提姆？我唔识浮水
Hey, Tim? I don't float.

861
00:45:21,971 --> 00:45:24,057
话咗鲤鱼王唔系冇用
Ha! I told you Magikarp weren't useless.

862
00:45:25,892 --> 00:45:27,644
你已经被拘捕
You're under arrest.

863
00:45:29,396 --> 00:45:32,023
我以为你赶住返屋企
I thought you couldn't wait to get home.

864
00:45:32,190 --> 00:45:35,068
系呀，但系计划有变　因为我揾到佢
Yeah. Well, my plans changed because I found him.

865
00:45:35,902 --> 00:45:37,153
我唔明
I'm not following.

866
00:45:37,501 --> 00:45:39,352
哈利未死，佢只Pokémon拍档仲在生　代表佢都一样
Harry's not dead. If his Pokemon partner

867
00:45:39,352 --> 00:45:41,203
哈利未死，佢只Pokémon拍档仲在生　代表佢都一样
is still alive, that means he is, too.

868
00:45:41,116 --> 00:45:42,575
呢啲唔算证据
That is not proof, son.

869
00:45:42,706 --> 00:45:43,890
﹣话佢知R单嘢　　﹣等阵
Tell him about the chemical R.

870
00:45:43,890 --> 00:45:45,074
﹣话佢知R单嘢　　﹣等阵
Give me a minute.

871
00:45:45,109 --> 00:45:46,493
哈利最后一单案　同地下对战有关
Harry's last case

872
00:45:46,493 --> 00:45:47,877
哈利最后一单案　同地下对战有关
had to do with those underground battles.

873
00:45:47,455 --> 00:45:48,832
我哋去𠮶度　揾到种化合物
That's why I was there. There's a chemical.

874
00:45:48,998 --> 00:45:50,041
我哋调查过
We ran an investigation.

875
00:45:50,481 --> 00:45:51,731
﹣哈利有发现，于是惹祸　　﹣𠮶单案已经完咗！
Harry figured it out and he's in trouble.

876
00:45:51,731 --> 00:45:52,982
﹣哈利有发现，于是惹祸　　﹣𠮶单案已经完咗！
That case is closed. Over!

877
00:45:53,017 --> 00:45:54,300
你要继续调查！　佢未死，我感觉到
You gotta reopen the investigation!

878
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:55,584
你要继续调查！　佢未死，我感觉到
He's out there, I can feel it.

879
00:45:55,619 --> 00:45:56,803
﹣骨子里，讲啦　　﹣我唔会讲
In your jellies. Go ahead, say it.

880
00:45:56,803 --> 00:45:57,987
﹣骨子里，讲啦　　﹣我唔会讲
I'm not gonna say that.

881
00:45:57,882 --> 00:46:00,093
探长，我⋯骨头深处都感觉到
I can feel it, Lieutenant, in my bones.

882
00:46:00,301 --> 00:46:01,678
﹣骨子里好啲　　﹣够喇！
- Not as good.    - Stop!

883
00:46:02,426 --> 00:46:04,661
仲有我听得明Pikachu讲嘢　每个字都一清二楚
Oh, yeah, and I can understand Pikachu,

884
00:46:04,661 --> 00:46:06,896
仲有我听得明Pikachu讲嘢　每个字都一清二楚
like, word perfect, so…

885
00:46:08,476 --> 00:46:09,561
提姆
Tim.

886
00:46:10,401 --> 00:46:12,268
失去至亲系沉重打击　逃避都好正常
It's very difficult coping with loss.

887
00:46:12,268 --> 00:46:14,136
失去至亲系沉重打击　逃避都好正常
Denial can be a powerful thing.

888
00:46:14,107 --> 00:46:17,277
我冇逃避，我知道我系啱！
No, I'm not in denial! I'm right, I know it!

889
00:46:17,444 --> 00:46:18,820
佢仲未死
He's… He's out there.

890
00:46:24,993 --> 00:46:27,162
我一直唔想畀你睇⋯
I never wanted to show you this,

891
00:46:27,328 --> 00:46:29,789
但系我谂你应该睇吓
but I think it's important you see it.

892
00:46:37,714 --> 00:46:40,216
咁严重嘅车祸，冇人可以生还
No one could survive a crash like that.

893
00:46:40,967 --> 00:46:42,635
你爸爸都一样
Not even your dad.

894
00:46:45,597 --> 00:46:47,932
佢走咗喇，提姆
He's gone, Tim.

895
00:46:59,194 --> 00:47:01,237
我应该坐𠮶班火车
I should've gotten on that train.

896
00:47:04,324 --> 00:47:05,742
唔明
What's that, kid?

897
00:47:08,703 --> 00:47:10,497
我妈妈死咗之后
After my mom died,

898
00:47:11,748 --> 00:47:13,625
我同我爸爸就开始疏远
my dad and I drifted apart.

899
00:47:13,898 --> 00:47:15,064
Er…

900
00:47:14,918 --> 00:47:18,797
佢搬咗嚟呢度，搏命工作
He moved here and poured himself into his work.

901
00:47:20,938 --> 00:47:22,705
后来佢想我搬嚟同佢住
And, eventually, he tried to get me

902
00:47:22,705 --> 00:47:24,473
后来佢想我搬嚟同佢住
to come live with him,

903
00:47:25,178 --> 00:47:26,471
但系我唔肯
but I wouldn't go.

904
00:47:28,139 --> 00:47:29,432
点解？
How come?

905
00:47:34,145 --> 00:47:35,855
我以为佢唔在乎
I didn't think he cared.

906
00:47:38,608 --> 00:47:43,571
我谂我习惯咗冇佢喺身边
I guess I just got used to him not being around

907
00:47:44,698 --> 00:47:47,617
而且一直都冇原谅佢
and I couldn't forgive him for it.

908
00:47:49,327 --> 00:47:50,995
直至我嚟到呢度
Until I got here.

909
00:47:54,916 --> 00:47:56,918
我发现佢其实好在乎
And I realized that he did care.

910
00:47:59,337 --> 00:48:02,298
但系我一直唔知道
But I didn't know…

911
00:48:03,633 --> 00:48:06,386
因为我从来冇畀机会佢
because I never gave him the chance.

912
00:48:07,637 --> 00:48:10,640
而家已经太迟
And now it's too late.

913
00:48:14,936 --> 00:48:16,187
我真系⋯
I really…

914
00:48:19,232 --> 00:48:21,776
我真系希望我有上𠮶班火车
I really wish I'd gotten on that train.

915
00:48:24,335 --> 00:48:25,768
Mmm-hmm.

916
00:48:28,950 --> 00:48:30,285
听住
Listen, kid.

917
00:48:31,308 --> 00:48:32,708
Um…

918
00:48:32,829 --> 00:48:34,956
我可能失咗忆⋯
Look, I may not have memories,

919
00:48:36,374 --> 00:48:38,043
但系有一件事我好清楚
um, but I know this much:

920
00:48:39,961 --> 00:48:41,212
呢件事唔系你嘅错
It wasn't your fault.

921
00:48:44,299 --> 00:48:46,259
唔系任何人嘅错
It wasn't anybody's fault.

922
00:48:48,887 --> 00:48:51,389
我肯定，如果你爸爸喺度⋯
And I'm sure that if your dad was here,

923
00:48:53,330 --> 00:48:55,298
佢会出尽力揽你，揽到你骨折
he would hug you so hard,

924
00:48:55,298 --> 00:48:57,266
佢会出尽力揽你，揽到你骨折
your bones would pop.

925
00:48:58,268 --> 00:48:59,702
然后佢会向你道歉
And he'd tell you

926
00:48:59,702 --> 00:49:01,137
然后佢会向你道歉
he's sorry for everything.

927
00:49:03,818 --> 00:49:06,154
佢肯定以你为荣
He'd be damn proud of you, kid.

928
00:49:10,367 --> 00:49:12,369
我一直都对你唔系几好
I haven't been really nice to you.

929
00:49:12,535 --> 00:49:14,245
真系冇好过
No, you really haven't.

930
00:49:18,541 --> 00:49:19,626
咁⋯
Well…

931
00:49:20,991 --> 00:49:22,658
﹣我哋仲有一个谜团要破解　　﹣咩谜团？
We still got one mystery to solve.

932
00:49:22,658 --> 00:49:24,326
﹣我哋仲有一个谜团要破解　　﹣咩谜团？
What?

933
00:49:24,297 --> 00:49:25,423
你嘅谜团
Yours.

934
00:49:27,092 --> 00:49:29,177
我哋去调查　边个搞成你咁
Let's find out who did this to you.

935
00:49:29,886 --> 00:49:31,137
帮你恢复记忆
Get your memory back.

936
00:49:31,304 --> 00:49:32,681
好呀
I'd like that.

937
00:49:33,890 --> 00:49:35,433
最好不过
I'd like that very much.

938
00:49:39,646 --> 00:49:41,147
一睇就知系反派嘅车
Well, that's a bad-guy car.

939
00:50:00,083 --> 00:50:01,251
唔该妳，洛曼小姐
Thank you, Miss Norman.

940
00:50:01,418 --> 00:50:03,920
系呀，唔该妳　洛曼小姐，妳可以走啦
Yes. Thank you, Miss Norman. That'll be all.

941
00:50:04,629 --> 00:50:06,006
佢哑嘅？
What a blabbermouth.

942
00:50:06,881 --> 00:50:09,050
请入嚟
Please, come in.

943
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:16,599
佢哋系咪好神奇嘅生物？
Magnificent creatures, aren't they?

944
00:50:24,315 --> 00:50:25,650
火伊布
Whoa. A Flareon.

945
00:50:27,444 --> 00:50:30,238
试想像，如果你可以进化⋯
Imagine being able to evolve

946
00:50:30,405 --> 00:50:33,116
变成最理想嘅自己
into the best possible version of yourself.

947
00:50:34,284 --> 00:50:35,326
你好
Hmm. 'Sup?

948
00:50:35,493 --> 00:50:39,831
体内嘅潜能　等住你去触发
That greatness inside you, just waiting to be awoken.

949
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:44,461
你好，提姆
Hello, Tim.

950
00:50:44,627 --> 00:50:46,046
佢识你？
He knows you?

951
00:50:46,212 --> 00:50:48,715
你同哈利嘅Pikachu做咗拍档
I see you've partnered with Harry's Pikachu.

952
00:50:48,882 --> 00:50:50,133
连我都识
And he knows me, too.

953
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:51,843
你识哈利？
You knew Harry?

954
00:50:52,177 --> 00:50:54,387
哈利查𠮶单案⋯
The case Harry was working on,

955
00:50:55,096 --> 00:50:56,306
系由我委托
it was for me.

956
00:50:56,473 --> 00:50:58,850
真系曲折离奇！好曲折！
That's a twist. That's very twisty.

957
00:50:59,017 --> 00:51:02,979
呢种化合物　威胁我建立嘅一切
This compound threatens everything I've built.

958
00:51:03,146 --> 00:51:05,315
佢都知R呢单嘢，佢点会知？
He knows about the R. How does he know about the R?

959
00:51:05,482 --> 00:51:07,901
我拜托哈利帮我查出来源
I hired Harry to trace it to its source.

960
00:51:08,234 --> 00:51:10,904
最后嘅答案令我好惊讶
Imagine my shock when the answer

961
00:51:11,237 --> 00:51:13,490
元凶竟然系我个仔
turned out to be my own son.

962
00:51:15,405 --> 00:51:17,807
我毕生费尽心血　保护人类同Pokémon之间嘅和谐
I've devoted my life to perfecting the partnership

963
00:51:17,807 --> 00:51:20,209
我毕生费尽心血　保护人类同Pokémon之间嘅和谐
between Pokemon and humans.

964
00:51:20,330 --> 00:51:23,583
因为Pokémon可以　启发我哋变得更好
A partnership where Pokemon bring out the best in us.

965
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:26,098
但系我忽略咗　身为父亲嘅责任
In doing so, I'm afraid I neglected

966
00:51:26,098 --> 00:51:28,417
但系我忽略咗　身为父亲嘅责任
my responsibilities as a parent.

967
00:51:31,216 --> 00:51:33,468
罗杰痛恨Pokémon
Roger resents the Pokemon.

968
00:51:33,635 --> 00:51:36,680
我谂佢活喺我阴影下太耐⋯
I think he's lived in my shadow for so long,

969
00:51:36,846 --> 00:51:39,808
决心要摧毁我嘅成就
he actually wants to destroy my legacy.

970
00:51:39,963 --> 00:51:41,297
所谓「父亲」，冇父点有亲
Well, there's no such thing

971
00:51:41,297 --> 00:51:42,631
所谓「父亲」，冇父点有亲
as "daddy issues" without "daddy".

972
00:51:42,727 --> 00:51:45,188
但系克里佛先生　你点可以容许佢咁做？
But, Mr. Clifford, how could you let him do that?

973
00:51:45,355 --> 00:51:48,066
自从我因病要坐轮椅⋯
Ever since my illness put me in this chair,

974
00:51:48,233 --> 00:51:51,069
罗杰就开始接掌公司大权
Roger has taken over more and more of the company.

975
00:51:51,341 --> 00:51:53,426
佢操控咗董事会　警察同政客都听佢指挥
He controls the board.

976
00:51:53,426 --> 00:51:55,511
佢操控咗董事会　警察同政客都听佢指挥
He also controls the police and the politicians.

977
00:51:55,490 --> 00:51:57,450
而且传媒都属于佢
And he owns the press.

978
00:51:57,617 --> 00:52:00,620
我可以相信嘅只有哈利
Harry is the only one I can trust.

979
00:52:00,787 --> 00:52:03,331
所以你要去揾佢
That's why you need to find him.

980
00:52:04,207 --> 00:52:05,709
你冇听到消息
You haven't heard.

981
00:52:05,875 --> 00:52:06,918
哈利已经死咗
Harry's dead.

982
00:52:07,544 --> 00:52:08,920
你错喇，提姆
Oh, no, Tim.

983
00:52:10,171 --> 00:52:11,548
你爸爸⋯
Your father

984
00:52:11,923 --> 00:52:13,258
尚在人间
is alive.

985
00:52:16,678 --> 00:52:18,013
小心呀！
Look out, kid!

986
00:52:22,308 --> 00:52:24,769
先进全息投影
Advanced holographic imaging.

987
00:52:24,936 --> 00:52:27,147
自从我要依靠轮椅⋯
Since being confined to this chair,

988
00:52:27,313 --> 00:52:32,152
我一直投资研究方法　将世界带嚟我面前
I've invested in ways of bringing the world to me.

989
00:52:32,485 --> 00:52:34,654
投影系用警方影像档重组
This was recreated from police footage.

990
00:52:34,821 --> 00:52:37,407
可以睇到佢哋睇唔到⋯
It allows us to see things that they cannot

991
00:52:37,574 --> 00:52:39,868
或者唔想我哋睇到嘅细节
or don't want us to see.

992
00:52:41,911 --> 00:52:43,079
佢未死
He's alive.

993
00:52:43,830 --> 00:52:45,040
Pika
Pika.

994
00:52:45,206 --> 00:52:46,875
系我，我同哈利一齐撞车
It's me. I was with Harry in the crash.

995
00:52:47,042 --> 00:52:48,043
我要去救佢
He needs my help.

996
00:52:51,338 --> 00:52:53,131
如果哈利未死　点解冇人揾到佢？
If Harry's alive, why didn't they find him?

997
00:53:01,097 --> 00:53:02,098
系咩嚟？
What is that?

998
00:53:02,265 --> 00:53:03,433
系超梦
Mewtwo.

999
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:05,894
人类创造嘅妖孽
A man-made abomination

1000
00:53:06,049 --> 00:53:08,801
实验室里面用古代梦幻嘅化石　内藏嘅基因重组而成
created in a laboratory using DNA

1001
00:53:08,801 --> 00:53:11,553
实验室里面用古代梦幻嘅化石　内藏嘅基因重组而成
from the fossil remains of the Ancient Mew.

1002
00:53:11,524 --> 00:53:12,901
难以置信
I can't believe it.

1003
00:53:13,068 --> 00:53:15,111
如果佢喺嚟自梦幻⋯
If that thing came from Mew,

1004
00:53:15,125 --> 00:53:16,776
肯定佢就会系　全世界最强嘅Pokémon
then we're looking at

1005
00:53:16,776 --> 00:53:18,427
肯定佢就会系　全世界最强嘅Pokémon
the most powerful Pokemon in the world.

1006
00:53:24,454 --> 00:53:27,207
系喇！原来系咁
That's it. That's what happened to me.

1007
00:53:27,374 --> 00:53:29,918
超梦消除咗我嘅记忆
Mewtwo wiped my memory.

1008
00:53:30,251 --> 00:53:31,252
但系点解咁做？
But why?

1009
00:53:36,466 --> 00:53:37,759
等阵！
Wait, wait, wait!

1010
00:53:44,057 --> 00:53:47,310
等阵，佢带咗佢去边？
Wait. Wait, wait. Where did it take him?

1011
00:53:47,477 --> 00:53:49,813
呢点要靠你调查
That's for you to solve now.

1012
00:53:49,979 --> 00:53:53,983
揾到超梦，就会揾到你爸爸
Find Mewtwo and you will find your father.

1013
00:53:58,201 --> 00:53:59,418
人生好少有第二次机会
Second chances

1014
00:53:59,418 --> 00:54:00,636
人生好少有第二次机会
are special things, kid.

1015
00:54:00,615 --> 00:54:02,575
破到呢单案系好事
There's a lot we can make better if we crack this case.

1016
00:54:02,742 --> 00:54:04,452
但系我有一个问题　我哋去紧边？
One question, though. Where are we going?

1017
00:54:04,675 --> 00:54:06,225
我唔知，我负责行　你负责指挥，你先系神探
I don't know, I'm just going.

1018
00:54:06,225 --> 00:54:07,776
我唔知，我负责行　你负责指挥，你先系神探
You gotta tell me where. You're the detective.

1019
00:54:07,997 --> 00:54:10,917
好，如果核心人物　系罗杰克里佛⋯
Okay. If Roger Clifford is the key to all of this…

1020
00:54:11,084 --> 00:54:13,753
就要揾个　可以接触到佢嘅人
Then we need someone who has access to him.

1021
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:16,297
唔使讲都知系边个啦，大情圣
And we both know who that is, lover boy.

1022
00:54:16,586 --> 00:54:18,254
够喇，唔好再讲呢样
Okay, come on, that's…

1023
00:54:18,254 --> 00:54:19,922
够喇，唔好再讲呢样
Come on. Let's not start that again.

1024
00:54:26,641 --> 00:54:28,018
佢嚟喇
There she is.

1025
00:54:28,184 --> 00:54:30,687
搞咩戴黑超　佢见唔见到我哋？
What's with the sunglasses? Can she see us?

1026
00:54:30,854 --> 00:54:32,105
佢点会见到我哋
I don't think she can see us.

1027
00:54:32,272 --> 00:54:35,233
﹣多谢妳嚟　　﹣咪同我讲嘢
- Hey. Thanks for coming.    - Don't talk to me.

1028
00:54:36,401 --> 00:54:37,485
好
Okay.

1029
00:54:38,361 --> 00:54:40,947
﹣而家点？　　﹣举止自然啲
- What happens now?    - Just act casual.

1030
00:54:41,114 --> 00:54:42,490
唔好望我
But don't look at me.

1031
00:54:43,867 --> 00:54:45,994
成件事一啲都唔自然
There's nothing really casual about this.

1032
00:54:46,745 --> 00:54:47,787
你睇呢份档案
Look at this.

1033
00:54:49,456 --> 00:54:50,999
唔好意思，系我衰
- Oh, shit.    - Sorry. That was my fault.

1034
00:54:51,374 --> 00:54:52,500
唔好意思⋯
- Ow!    - Sorry. I'm sorry.

1035
00:54:52,756 --> 00:54:53,989
真系好有火花　直接叫佢过嚟坐啦
Oh, this is working out great.

1036
00:54:53,989 --> 00:54:55,223
真系好有火花　直接叫佢过嚟坐啦
Why don't you just have her sit over here.

1037
00:54:55,045 --> 00:54:56,171
不如一齐坐？
You wanna just come sit with us?

1038
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:57,710
我唔应该鼓励你　你唔会有机会
I should never have encouraged you.

1039
00:54:57,710 --> 00:54:58,860
我唔应该鼓励你　你唔会有机会
You have no chance.

1040
00:54:58,895 --> 00:55:00,095
﹣我开咗罗杰部电脑　　﹣咁劲，点做到？
I got access to Roger's computer.

1041
00:55:00,095 --> 00:55:01,296
﹣我开咗罗杰部电脑　　﹣咁劲，点做到？
Oh, wow, how'd you do that?

1042
00:55:01,331 --> 00:55:02,731
﹣倒杯咖啡落佢大脾　　﹣真系浪费
Spilled a cappuccino on his lap.

1043
00:55:02,731 --> 00:55:04,132
﹣倒杯咖啡落佢大脾　　﹣真系浪费
Eh, that sounds like a waste of coffee.

1044
00:55:04,167 --> 00:55:05,684
我起咗佢底　尤其是佢喺呢一带嘅物业
I searched through all his records.

1045
00:55:05,684 --> 00:55:07,202
我起咗佢底　尤其是佢喺呢一带嘅物业
I targeted the property rights in the region

1046
00:55:07,237 --> 00:55:09,421
然后比对市政局记录　佢家族资助嘅公司，终于揾到⋯
and I cross-checked that with city records

1047
00:55:09,421 --> 00:55:11,606
然后比对市政局记录　佢家族资助嘅公司，终于揾到⋯
for any Clifford-financed businesses until I found it.

1048
00:55:11,519 --> 00:55:14,064
呢间机构PCL
May I present PCL:

1049
00:55:14,177 --> 00:55:15,928
一间Pokémon基因研究所，唔止咁
A Pokemon genetic research facility.

1050
00:55:15,928 --> 00:55:17,679
一间Pokémon基因研究所，唔止咁
But that's not all.

1051
00:55:17,650 --> 00:55:18,777
佢有啲料到
She's good.

1052
00:55:18,882 --> 00:55:20,716
上个礼拜，PCL发生「意外」　全部设施都要关闭
Last week, PCL had an "accident"

1053
00:55:20,716 --> 00:55:22,551
上个礼拜，PCL发生「意外」　全部设施都要关闭
and had to shut down their entire facility.

1054
00:55:22,655 --> 00:55:24,616
正正系哈利古德曼失踪𠮶晚
That's the same night Harry Goodman went missing.

1055
00:55:25,492 --> 00:55:27,118
冇人知道发生咩事
No one knows what happened.

1056
00:55:27,285 --> 00:55:29,454
传媒完全冇报导
Total media blackout.

1057
00:55:29,621 --> 00:55:30,997
咩意思？
What does it all mean?

1058
00:55:31,164 --> 00:55:32,749
我唔知，但系我好兴奋
I don't know. This is very exciting.

1059
00:55:32,916 --> 00:55:34,125
﹣你兴唔兴奋？　　﹣兴奋
- Are you excited?    - Yeah.

1060
00:55:34,292 --> 00:55:36,127
佢好似兴奋到尿渗
I think he just peed a little.

1061
00:55:36,294 --> 00:55:38,338
搞错咗，尿渗嘅系我
Oh, nope. That's me. That was me.

1062
00:55:38,505 --> 00:55:41,549
所以呢单嘢有内幕？
So, um, there's a cover-up?

1063
00:55:41,738 --> 00:55:43,005
Mmm-hmm.

1064
00:55:43,968 --> 00:55:45,929
佢哋想隐瞒啲咩？
But, er, what are they covering up?

1065
00:55:47,514 --> 00:55:49,307
我哋去查个究竟
What do you say we go find out?

1066
00:56:06,241 --> 00:56:07,534
等我搞清楚先
So let me get this right.

1067
00:56:07,631 --> 00:56:10,116
我哋被迫听呢啲水疗音乐　费事你爆炸，炸死我哋
We're forced to listen to this spa music

1068
00:56:10,116 --> 00:56:12,601
我哋被迫听呢啲水疗音乐　费事你爆炸，炸死我哋
so your head doesn't explode and kill us all.

1069
00:56:12,455 --> 00:56:13,456
可达
Psyduck.

1070
00:56:13,998 --> 00:56:16,292
你嘅Pikachu好特别
Your Pikachu is so unusual.

1071
00:56:17,168 --> 00:56:18,003
可达
Psyduck.

1072
00:56:18,169 --> 00:56:20,714
放低你只脚　我系唔会帮你按摩
Hey, you put that down. I am not giving you a massage.

1073
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:21,881
可达
Psyduck.

1074
00:56:22,048 --> 00:56:24,551
我未见过Pokémon会戴帽
I have never known a Pokemon to wear a hat.

1075
00:56:24,718 --> 00:56:26,094
佢系好怪，好鬼怪
Yeah, he's weird. He's so weird.

1076
00:56:26,283 --> 00:56:27,683
﹣可达　　﹣我梗系关心拍档生死
Psyduck.

1077
00:56:27,683 --> 00:56:29,084
﹣可达　　﹣我梗系关心拍档生死
Of course I care about my partner's life.

1078
00:56:29,055 --> 00:56:30,890
得喇，伸只脚过嚟
Fine, fine. Hand it over.

1079
00:56:31,788 --> 00:56:33,289
﹣你搞乜呀？　　﹣咩事？
What are you doing?

1080
00:56:33,289 --> 00:56:34,790
﹣你搞乜呀？　　﹣咩事？
What?

1081
00:56:34,686 --> 00:56:37,022
冇嘢，我只系好奇⋯佢系边个
Nothing.

1082
00:56:37,188 --> 00:56:39,315
（路伦博士因争议性研究失去职位）
I was actually wondering who this was.

1083
00:56:40,191 --> 00:56:43,486
PCL首席科学家，安妮路伦博士
It's PCL's chief scientist, Dr. Anne Laurent.

1084
00:56:43,653 --> 00:56:45,488
个唔著衫友讲嘅实系佢
I bet this is the doctor Shirtless was talking about.

1085
00:56:45,502 --> 00:56:46,902
佢嘅Pokémon实验　被大学撤销拨款
She lost her university grant

1086
00:56:46,902 --> 00:56:48,303
佢嘅Pokémon实验　被大学撤销拨款
over experimentation of Pokemon

1087
00:56:48,324 --> 00:56:50,118
因为佢尝试精神控制Pokémon
because she was trying to control their minds.

1088
00:56:50,373 --> 00:56:51,506
Oh, wow.

1089
00:56:51,244 --> 00:56:53,621
佢基本上系Pokémon精神学家
She's essentially a neurologist for Pokemon.

1090
00:56:53,877 --> 00:56:55,127
或者佢会知道　畀人绑喺炸弹旁边
Maybe she could weigh in

1091
00:56:55,127 --> 00:56:56,378
或者佢会知道　畀人绑喺炸弹旁边
on the long-term psychological effects

1092
00:56:56,413 --> 00:56:58,481
会有咩长期精神影响
of being strapped into a baby seat

1093
00:56:58,481 --> 00:57:00,549
会有咩长期精神影响
- next to a bomb.    - Hmm?

1094
00:57:04,549 --> 00:57:05,925
到喇
This is it.

1095
00:57:08,970 --> 00:57:10,180
你睇啲警告牌
Look at the signs.

1096
00:57:10,347 --> 00:57:11,765
（禁止进入 剧毒物质）

1097
00:57:11,931 --> 00:57:13,767
肯定系好大件事
Must have been a really bad accident.

1098
00:57:14,309 --> 00:57:15,894
就系想你咁谂
That's what they want you to believe.

1099
00:57:16,061 --> 00:57:17,771
装假狗嘅人好高招
Whoever staged this did an excellent job.

1100
00:57:17,937 --> 00:57:19,939
标志肯定吓走晒啲傻仔
Those signs are the perfect scarecrow for suckers.

1101
00:57:20,106 --> 00:57:21,816
我都畀佢哋吓到
Yeah, well, they're working on me.

1102
00:57:21,983 --> 00:57:24,110
呢条女想冒险
Kid, this dame's looking for danger.

1103
00:57:24,241 --> 00:57:25,624
你要得佢欢心　就要带佢去闯关
You want to win her over,

1104
00:57:25,624 --> 00:57:27,008
你要得佢欢心　就要带佢去闯关
you gotta lead her straight to it.

1105
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:29,616
首先，女人唔系一条条嘅
First of all, women don't like to be called "dame".

1106
00:57:29,783 --> 00:57:33,703
第二，女人钟意嘅系沉著冷静
Second, women appreciate calm, er, level-headed

1107
00:57:33,870 --> 00:57:36,331
负责任嘅判断
and responsible decision-making.

1108
00:57:36,498 --> 00:57:38,792
佢做咩？喂，喂！
What is she doing? Hey, hey!

1109
00:57:39,459 --> 00:57:40,460
喂！
Hey!

1110
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:43,046
露丝，妳搞乜？
Lucy, what are you doing?

1111
00:57:43,213 --> 00:57:46,174
我要剪开铁丝网　开路入去
I'm, er, I'm cutting the fence so that we can slip through.

1112
00:57:46,563 --> 00:57:47,930
﹣妳去边度揾架生？　　﹣你咪理
Where did you get those?

1113
00:57:47,930 --> 00:57:49,297
﹣妳去边度揾架生？　　﹣你咪理
Oh, don't worry about it.

1114
00:57:49,177 --> 00:57:50,303
﹣你先啦，请　　﹣可达
After you, sir.

1115
00:57:50,867 --> 00:57:52,067
唔制？好，我行先　总之你要冷静

1116
00:57:52,067 --> 00:57:53,268
唔制？好，我行先　总之你要冷静
I'll go first. Whatever's most calming.

Hmm, Psyduck.

1118
00:58:09,781 --> 00:58:11,408

00:58:11,741 --> 00:58:12,742

Okay.

00:58:14,994 --> 00:58:16,871
可达，可达
Psyduck. Psyduck.

1121
00:58:21,698 --> 00:58:22,698
Oh.

1122
00:58:24,004 --> 00:58:26,339
唔紧要，你唔使落地
It's okay. You can stay up there.

1123
00:58:33,877 --> 00:58:36,545
我系有失忆症　都肯定呢个系史上最差嘅计划
I may have amnesia, but I'm pretty sure

1124
00:58:36,545 --> 00:58:39,214
我系有失忆症　都肯定呢个系史上最差嘅计划
this is the worst idea anyone's ever had.

1125
00:58:42,063 --> 00:58:43,481
系咩嚟？
What is that?

1126
00:58:44,941 --> 00:58:46,234
唔清楚
I'm not sure.

1127
00:58:49,195 --> 00:58:51,614
可达，可达
Psyduck. Psyduck.

1128
00:58:53,450 --> 00:58:54,826
系甲贺忍蛙
It's Greninja.

1129
00:58:55,326 --> 00:58:56,828
但系睇落唔对路
But they don't look right.

1130
00:58:57,203 --> 00:58:58,747
「测试22」
"Test 22."

1131
00:58:59,247 --> 00:59:00,874
（进化测试）　「力量强化」？
"Power enhancement"?

1132
00:59:02,876 --> 00:59:04,502
佢哋系实验对象
They were experimenting on them.

1133
00:59:04,669 --> 00:59:05,754
但系点解？
But why?

1134
00:59:05,742 --> 00:59:07,943
如果幕后黑手系罗杰克里佛　佢点解要揾Pokémon做实验？
If Roger Clifford's behind this,

1135
00:59:07,943 --> 00:59:10,145
如果幕后黑手系罗杰克里佛　佢点解要揾Pokémon做实验？
what's he doing experimenting on Pokemon?

1136
00:59:17,432 --> 00:59:18,808
土台龟花园
A Torterra garden.

1137
00:59:25,295 --> 00:59:27,313
「Pokémon进化测试33　成长强化」
"Pokemon evolution test 33.

1138
00:59:27,313 --> 00:59:29,331
「Pokémon进化测试33　成长强化」
"Growth enhancement."

1139
00:59:29,527 --> 00:59:31,279
睇落大细冇乜唔妥
They look normal-sized to me.

1140
00:59:32,238 --> 00:59:34,240
可能未开始
Maybe it hasn't started yet.

1141
00:59:35,241 --> 00:59:38,995
佢哋好似想操控Pokémon进化
It's like they're trying to manipulate Pokemon evolution.

1142
00:59:39,746 --> 00:59:41,414
有可能咩？
Is that even possible?

1143
00:59:42,082 --> 00:59:43,333
我都唔知
I don't know.

1144
00:59:44,167 --> 00:59:46,711
不过我要记录一切
I need to document all of this, though.

1145
00:59:52,217 --> 00:59:53,718
你行先，我阵间跟上嚟
<i>You go ahead. I'll catch up to you.</i>

1146
00:59:53,885 --> 00:59:55,053
﹣妳肯定？　　﹣肯定
- <i>Are you sure?</i>    - <i>Yeah.</i>

1147
01:00:11,441 --> 01:00:12,641
Whoa.

1148
01:00:14,322 --> 01:00:15,824
呢度发生咩事？
What happened here?

1149
01:00:15,990 --> 01:00:17,492
肯定冇好嘢
Bad stuff.

1150
01:00:17,659 --> 01:00:19,494
非常唔妥
Really bad stuff.

1151
01:00:20,328 --> 01:00:22,372
仲认为危险标志系装假狗？
Still think this was staged?

1152
01:00:29,212 --> 01:00:32,048
细路，过嚟呀
Kid, hey! Over here.

1153
01:00:32,674 --> 01:00:35,093
系路伦博士部机
It says Dr. Laurent's station.

1154
01:00:35,552 --> 01:00:37,470
好似仲运作紧
Looks like it's still working.

1155
01:00:46,688 --> 01:00:48,940
开始遥控操作
<i>Remote access initiated.</i>

1156
01:00:55,739 --> 01:00:57,449
可达！
Psyduck!

1157
01:01:03,538 --> 01:01:05,290
大部分档案都损毁咗
Looks like most of the files are corrupted.

1158
01:01:08,209 --> 01:01:10,253
哎呀，又系全息投影
Uh-oh. Another one of those holograms.

1159
01:01:21,473 --> 01:01:22,640
第42日
Day 42.

1160
01:01:23,413 --> 01:01:25,330
经过多次尝试　我哋终于揾到一个稳定嘅方法
After much trial and error

1161
01:01:25,330 --> 01:01:27,248
经过多次尝试　我哋终于揾到一个稳定嘅方法
we perfected a stable method

1162
01:01:27,270 --> 01:01:30,565
去抽取超梦嘅基因
to extract Mewtwo's DNA.

1163
01:01:30,732 --> 01:01:32,817
系超梦，等阵
It's Mewtwo. No, wait.

1164
01:01:32,984 --> 01:01:35,111
咪住，超梦嚟自呢度？
Wait, Mewtwo came from this place?

1165
01:01:36,821 --> 01:01:41,159
第60日，临床测试成功
Day 60. Clinical trials proven successful.

1166
01:01:41,631 --> 01:01:44,650
吸入剂导致混乱，而且　完全失去自由意志
The inhalant results in confusion

1167
01:01:44,650 --> 01:01:47,669
吸入剂导致混乱，而且　完全失去自由意志
and the total loss of free will.

1168
01:01:47,749 --> 01:01:51,670
Pokémon因此野性大发
Which, in turn, makes the Pokemon go wild.

1169
01:01:51,961 --> 01:01:56,257
我哋将呢种化合物称为R血清
We've designated this chemical as serum R.

1170
01:01:58,510 --> 01:01:59,969
佢哋用超梦生产R
They used Mewtwo to make R.

1171
01:02:00,136 --> 01:02:03,139
然后喺对战场做测试
And they were testing it at the battles.

1172
01:02:06,559 --> 01:02:09,020
第68日
Day 68.

1173
01:02:09,187 --> 01:02:11,606
神经连结运作正常
The neural link is operational.

1174
01:02:11,728 --> 01:02:13,596
警告，红色警戒
<i>Alert.</i>

1175
01:02:13,596 --> 01:02:15,464
警告，红色警戒
<i>-Condition: Red.</i> -Oh.

1176
01:02:17,987 --> 01:02:19,489
大件事⋯
No. No, no, no!

1177
01:02:19,781 --> 01:02:21,408
密闭室能源不足⋯
We're losing power in the containment…

1178
01:02:33,817 --> 01:02:35,401
﹣超梦一定系咁逃脱　　﹣终于有进展
That must've been how Mewtwo escaped.

1179
01:02:35,401 --> 01:02:36,985
﹣超梦一定系咁逃脱　　﹣终于有进展
Now we're getting somewhere.

1180
01:02:37,020 --> 01:02:38,737
﹣佢点解要针对哈利？　　﹣问得好
What did that thing want with Harry?

1181
01:02:38,737 --> 01:02:40,455
﹣佢点解要针对哈利？　　﹣问得好
Good question, kid.

1182
01:02:40,385 --> 01:02:42,554
我试吓由头睇
I'll try and take us back to the beginning.

1183
01:02:48,977 --> 01:02:51,980
第1日，实验室差不多全面运作
Day 1. The lab is almostfully operational.

1184
01:02:52,402 --> 01:02:54,887
而家我哋只需要捕捉　人类史上最强嘅Pokémon⋯
All that remains now is to capture

1185
01:02:54,887 --> 01:02:57,372
而家我哋只需要捕捉　人类史上最强嘅Pokémon⋯
the most powerful Pokemon known to mankind:

1186
01:02:57,318 --> 01:02:58,403
超梦
Mewtwo.

1187
01:02:59,612 --> 01:03:03,324
佢喺20年前由关东地区逃脱
It escaped nearly 20 years ago from the Kanto region.

1188
01:03:03,546 --> 01:03:05,380
好在我哋嘅金主　请咗一位专家揾佢
Fortunately, our benefactor's

1189
01:03:05,380 --> 01:03:07,215
好在我哋嘅金主　请咗一位专家揾佢
hired a specialist to track it down.

1190
01:03:07,120 --> 01:03:08,580
祝你好运，古德曼警探
Good luck, Detective Goodman.

1191
01:03:15,658 --> 01:03:17,893
原来超梦捉走哈利　系要报复畀佢捉到
That's why Mewtwo took Harry.

1192
01:03:17,893 --> 01:03:20,128
原来超梦捉走哈利　系要报复畀佢捉到
It was revenge for being captured.

1193
01:03:20,163 --> 01:03:21,630
完全唔合理　哈利冇可能参与呢件事
This doesn't make any sense.

1194
01:03:21,630 --> 01:03:23,097
完全唔合理　哈利冇可能参与呢件事
Harry would've never been a part of this.

1195
01:03:22,635 --> 01:03:24,846
我都想信，但系要面对现实
I wanna believe that, kid. But we gotta be honest here.

1196
01:03:25,013 --> 01:03:26,806
你多年冇见佢，我又失忆
You haven't seen him in years, and I got amnesia.

1197
01:03:26,936 --> 01:03:28,336
我哋根本唔清楚哈利份人
Neither of us can say for sure

1198
01:03:28,336 --> 01:03:29,737
我哋根本唔清楚哈利份人
what Harry would or wouldn't do.

1199
01:03:29,768 --> 01:03:31,061
我哋要快啲返入市区
We gotta get back to the city.

1200
01:03:31,227 --> 01:03:34,147
露丝，露丝，我哋要快啲返去⋯
Lucy. Lucy, we gotta get back to…

1201
01:03:38,651 --> 01:03:39,861
露丝？
Lucy?

1202
01:03:41,821 --> 01:03:43,031
露丝？
Lucy?

1203
01:03:50,705 --> 01:03:52,874
之前冇呢挞嘢
That was not there before, kid.

1204
01:04:04,761 --> 01:04:06,471
小心后面
Look behind you.

1205
01:04:06,609 --> 01:04:08,643
Whoa!

1206
01:04:08,682 --> 01:04:09,849
拉火警钟！
Kid, the fire alarm!

1207
01:04:14,517 --> 01:04:16,034

1220
01:04:52,642 --> 01:04:54,728
可达！可达！可达！可达！
Psyduck! Psyduck! Psyduck! Psyduck!

1221
01:04:56,893 --> 01:04:58,443
﹣可达！　　﹣唔使惊，可达鸭，冇事嘅
- Psyduck!    - It's okay, Psyduck.

1222
01:04:58,443 --> 01:04:59,994
﹣可达！　　﹣唔使惊，可达鸭，冇事嘅
Everything's fine.

1223
01:05:00,025 --> 01:05:01,317
佢要爆喇
He's gonna blow his stack, kid.

1224
01:05:01,484 --> 01:05:03,695
唔使惊，可达鸭，冷静啲
It's okay, Psyduck, it's okay. Calm down.

1225
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:07,157
可达！
Psyduck!

1226
01:05:09,172 --> 01:05:10,556
冇时间陪你头痛
This is no time

1227
01:05:10,556 --> 01:05:11,940
冇时间陪你头痛
for your stupid headaches.

1228
01:05:11,244 --> 01:05:14,497
咪住，而家正正适合头痛
No, wait, this is the perfect time to get a headache.

1229
01:05:14,664 --> 01:05:16,708
﹣可达？　　﹣我好憎帮你按脚
- Psyduck?    - I hated rubbing your feet.

1230
01:05:16,875 --> 01:05:18,376
冷静啲，冷静啲！
Calm down, calm down!

1231
01:05:18,543 --> 01:05:20,253
我唔会原谅我双手帮你按脚
I'll never forgive my hands for what they did.

1232
01:05:20,420 --> 01:05:23,214
痛爆你个头啦，神经鸭！
Get a splitting headache now, you neurotic duck!

1233
01:05:23,381 --> 01:05:26,259
快啲爆！爆呀！爆呀！
Do it! Do it! Do it!

1234
01:05:35,268 --> 01:05:37,062
可达
Psyduck.

1235
01:05:37,228 --> 01:05:39,773
做得好，可达鸭，我顶帽呢？
Good job, Psyduck. Where's my hat?

1236
01:05:45,695 --> 01:05:46,780
有啲唔妥
Something's wrong.

1237
01:06:03,672 --> 01:06:05,507
唔系啩？
Is this really happening?

1238
01:06:06,049 --> 01:06:07,050
唔使担心
Don't worry.

1239
01:06:07,467 --> 01:06:10,387
可逹鸭嘅精神力量　令我哋产生幻觉
Psyduck's psionic waves are causing hallucinations.

1240
01:06:10,553 --> 01:06:11,930
唔系真嘅
None of this is real.

1241
01:06:11,901 --> 01:06:13,535
系真㗎！走呀！
Nope.

1242
01:06:13,535 --> 01:06:15,169
系真㗎！走呀！
All of this is real! Run!

1243
01:06:15,204 --> 01:06:16,938
Go, go, go!

1244
01:06:25,068 --> 01:06:27,779
﹣发生咩事？　　﹣快啲走！
- What's happening?    - Let's go! Let's go!

1245
01:06:29,952 --> 01:06:32,387
搞成咁，仲有边个唔信气候变化？
At this point,

1246
01:06:32,387 --> 01:06:34,823
搞成咁，仲有边个唔信气候变化？
how could you not believe in climate change?

1247
01:06:48,037 --> 01:06:49,438
﹣死喇！　　﹣有我接住
Oh no, no, no!

1248
01:06:49,438 --> 01:06:50,839
﹣死喇！　　﹣有我接住
I got you.

1249
01:06:52,178 --> 01:06:53,179
提姆！

走快啲！
Go, go, go!

1253
01:07:06,109 --> 01:07:07,110
跳
Okay.

1254
01:07:17,162 --> 01:07:18,246
我哋冇死
We made it.

1255
01:07:19,247 --> 01:07:21,166
我好鬼憎呢个森林
I officially hate this forest.

1256
01:07:30,091 --> 01:07:31,092
提姆！
Tim!

1257

就嚟冇路走
Kid, the walls are closing in.

1261
01:07:47,734 --> 01:07:50,195
要快啲谂办法
We have to do something and we gotta do it fast.

1262
01:07:50,362 --> 01:07:51,279
我要跳过去
I gotta jump for it.

1263
01:07:51,446 --> 01:07:54,366
呢个E计划唔错　谂咗ABCD先啦
That's a great fifth option. Let's work on the first four.

1264
01:07:54,532 --> 01:07:56,659
﹣你跳唔到咁远！　　﹣冇得拣
- You're not gonna make it!    - There's no other choice.

1265
01:07:56,772 --> 01:07:58,373
我哋大把选择　但系跌死咗就⋯
We have a lot of choices.

1266
01:07:58,373 --> 01:07:59,974
我哋大把选择　但系跌死咗就⋯
Falling to our death is not one of…

1267
01:08:06,711 --> 01:08:07,712
提姆！
Tim!

1268
01:08:08,922 --> 01:08:10,882
出力拉呀！
Pull, pull, pull!

1269
01:08:11,049 --> 01:08:12,133
出力爬！
Come on!

1270
01:08:15,720 --> 01:08:18,723
我以为⋯我以为我⋯
I thought I was gonna… I thought I was gonna…

1271
01:08:18,890 --> 01:08:21,184
我⋯我⋯
I… I…

1272
01:08:21,351 --> 01:08:22,352
我见到眼球
Eyeball.

1273
01:08:22,727 --> 01:08:24,521
眼球，眼球！
Eyeball. Eyeball!

1274
01:08:37,492 --> 01:08:38,868
我明啦！
Oh! I get it!

1275
01:08:39,828 --> 01:08:42,706
我明啦，呢个唔系森林
I get it now. This isn't a forest at all.

1276
01:08:43,331 --> 01:08:46,835
成个都系土台龟花园
This is the Torterra garden.

1277
01:08:55,427 --> 01:08:56,428
Pikachu！
Pikachu!

1278
01:09:22,662 --> 01:09:23,663
可达
Psyduck.

1279
01:09:27,125 --> 01:09:28,418
佢受咗伤
He's hurt.

1280
01:09:31,212 --> 01:09:33,173
﹣佢点呀？　　﹣我唔得喇
- Is he okay?    - I'm in bad shape, kid.

1281
01:09:33,340 --> 01:09:35,008
我喺度呀，拍档，我喺度
I'm here, partner. I'm here.

1282
01:09:36,468 --> 01:09:39,179
你头先叫我拍档？
Did you just call me partner?

我哋都唔肯定
We don't know that.

1340
01:15:51,259 --> 01:15:55,513
大家有眼见　我背叛咗你老窦，即系⋯

1341
01:15:56,389 --> 01:15:57,599
我都可以背叛你
I could betray you, too.

1342
01:15:57,766 --> 01:15:59,851
你唔会，我唔在乎见到咩
You wouldn't do that. I don't care what I saw.

1347
01:16:06,711 --> 01:16:08,395
我之前乱讲，骨子里冇嘢　我都系个假象
There's no jellies. There's no me.

I don't believe that.

你靠自己好过
You're better off on your own.

1350

我唔会对我嘅　怪鸡眼版女神留手
I'm very attracted to.

1512
01:26:26,061 --> 01:26:27,979
向上飞，唔好索啲气体
Uh-oh! Pull up, pull up. Don't breathe the gas.

1513
01:26:29,397 --> 01:26:30,982
你系咪索晒？
You breathed the gas, didn't you?

1514
01:26:39,616 --> 01:26:40,700

01:28:08,329 --> 01:28:09,956
𠮶只百变怪有冇咁劲呀？

Ditto…

1531
01:28:58,546 --> 01:29:00,090
简直螳臂挡车
A feeble effort.

1532
01:29:00,256 --> 01:29:04,260
Pikachu冇可能打赢超梦
A Pikachu cannot defeat Mewtwo in battle.

1533
01:29:05,053 --> 01:29:07,347

I didn't need to defeat you.

1534
01:29:07,597 --> 01:29:09,933
只需要分散你注意力
I just needed to distract you.

1535
01:29:12,514 --> 01:29:13,513
Huh.

Pikachu！
Pikachu!

1540
01:29:28,785 --> 01:29:29,786

﹣Pikachu！　　﹣提姆！
- Pikachu!    - Tim!

1542
01:29:47,303 --> 01:29:48,471
你冇嘢嘛？
- Oh!    - Are you okay?

1543
01:29:48,550 --> 01:29:50,784
对唔住，你最需要我嘅时候　我推开咗你
I'm sorry. I'm sorry I pushed you away

1544
01:29:50,784 --> 01:29:53,019
对唔住，你最需要我嘅时候　我推开咗你

我会令一切恢复原状
I will undo what has been done.

1549
01:30:36,603 --> 01:30:39,898
以后唔好再试，好嘛？
Let's never do that again, okay?

1550
01:30:55,914 --> 01:30:59,292
最奇怪嘅系　无论佢有几多缺点⋯
The strange thing is that, no matter what his flaws,

1551
01:30:59,459 --> 01:31:01,044
到头来⋯
deep down,

1552
01:31:01,836 --> 01:31:04,589
我都系怪责自己　冇好好陪佢
I blame myself for not being there for him.

1553
01:31:05,293 --> 01:31:07,995
妳之前就调查呢单消息　冇人知道前已经有线索

Had a lead on it before anyone else even knew.

1555
01:31:10,732 --> 01:31:12,032
﹣冇错　　﹣好，我要妳上镜
That's correct.

1556
01:31:12,032 --> 01:31:13,333
﹣冇错　　﹣好，我要妳上镜
Good. Right, you're going on camera.

我要妳今晚黄金时段　主持CNM专题报道
I want you giving an in-depth report

1558
01:31:15,202 --> 01:31:17,036
我要妳今晚黄金时段　主持CNM专题报道

1559
01:31:16,976 --> 01:31:18,603
记住最后要讲⋯
And make sure you close with:

1562
01:31:23,149 --> 01:31:26,611

Great work. Hey, calm down. Stay calm. Okay.

1566
01:31:36,824 --> 01:31:38,241

Oh, I hope we never

1567
01:31:38,241 --> 01:31:39,659
希望以后唔好再见
- get to see each other again.    - Hmm.
