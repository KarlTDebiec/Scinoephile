1
00:02:00,625 --> 00:02:02,333
Police.

2
00:02:02,333 --> 00:02:04,250
Show me your ID.

3
00:02:10,292 --> 00:02:12,208
- Check his ID.
- Yes sir.

4
00:02:12,917 --> 00:02:14,708
- What's in your bag?
- Headquarter,

5
00:02:14,708 --> 00:02:19,042
- Let me see.
- please verify ID number C532743…

6
00:02:19,042 --> 00:02:20,625
Bracket 1, Kwai Ching-hung.

7
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:23,458
Open it.

8
00:02:33,083 --> 00:02:35,375
The arrangement for Hong Kong

9
00:02:35,375 --> 00:02:40,375
contained in the agreement
are not measures of expediency.

10
00:02:40,375 --> 00:02:44,583
They are long-term policies
which will be incorporated

11
00:02:44,583 --> 00:02:47,000
in the Basic Law for Hong Kong

12
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,917
and preserved intact for 50 years from 1997.

13
00:02:52,792 --> 00:02:55,292
It is the common interest

14
00:02:55,292 --> 00:02:59,792
as well as shared
responsibilities of China and Britain

15
00:02:59,792 --> 00:03:07,208
to ensure the Joint Declaration is fully
implemented with no encumbrances.

16
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:30,875
An armed robbery took place this afternoon in Kwun Tong.

17
00:03:30,875 --> 00:03:34,958
4 armed suspects robbed 5 gold shops
on Mut Wah Street.

18
00:03:34,958 --> 00:03:36,167
Fuck you!

19
00:03:36,167 --> 00:03:39,167
In the footage provided by our audience,

20
00:03:39,167 --> 00:03:42,542
the robbers exchanged fire

21
00:03:42,542 --> 00:03:44,625
with the Special Duties Unit.

22
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:48,292
2 passersby and 3 policemen
were injured in the incident.

23
00:03:48,292 --> 00:03:51,292
The 5 gold shops lost $10M in total.

24
00:03:51,292 --> 00:03:53,583
The police believe the mastermind

25
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:55,500
is the "Most Wanted" Yip Kwok-foon.

26
00:03:58,167 --> 00:04:02,333
Bro foon, you're unbeatable!

27
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:04,958
But shit has hit the fan!

28
00:04:05,667 --> 00:04:07,625
I told you to put more newspaper underneath!

29
00:04:07,625 --> 00:04:09,750
Look, there's blood everywhere!

30
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,917
Take it, jerk!

31
00:04:15,208 --> 00:04:17,083
Shit has really hit the fan!

32
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:20,458
I can give you 20% tops. Sorry.

33
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:22,000
We agreed on 40%.

34
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,625
Don't you have moral principle?

35
00:04:23,625 --> 00:04:26,000
You're paying $2M for $10M's worth of swag?

36
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,500
We used to get 50%!

37
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:29,500
Now you fences are getting it all!

38
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,292
We're getting shit!

39
00:04:31,292 --> 00:04:33,333
Times have changed.

40
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:35,875
The cops are on the prowl!

41
00:04:42,417 --> 00:04:45,333
Especially for your swag, Bro Foon!

42
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:49,000
It took us 2 years to fence it last time!

43
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:52,417
Stocks, real estate,
and even chestnuts are more profitable!

44
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:56,917
Do me a favor.

45
00:04:56,917 --> 00:04:58,167
40%.

46
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:04,625
Bro Foon, you always have your way!

47
00:05:09,583 --> 00:05:11,792
How about you find another fence?

48
00:05:11,792 --> 00:05:14,375
If I can't take it, I doubt others would dare to!

49
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:15,958
Fuck you!

50
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:19,875
Open the safe!

51
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:21,500
Are you robbing me?

52
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:33,333
Don't make me do it.

53
00:05:58,667 --> 00:06:00,708
Thanks so much, Bro Foon.

54
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:04,792
Don't look me up in the future.

55
00:06:04,792 --> 00:06:06,792
There's no more business between us!

56
00:06:09,542 --> 00:06:11,417
We go separate ways!

57
00:06:45,667 --> 00:06:47,875
Light, Bro Foon.
