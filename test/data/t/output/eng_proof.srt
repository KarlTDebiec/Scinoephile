1
00:01:58,792 --> 00:02:00,459
Police.

2
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,417
Show me your ID.

3
00:02:08,458 --> 00:02:10,375
- Check his ID.
- Yes sir.

4
00:02:11,083 --> 00:02:12,833
- What's in your bag?
- Headquarters,

5
00:02:12,875 --> 00:02:17,167
- Let me see.
- Please verify ID number C532743...

6
00:02:17,208 --> 00:02:18,791
Bracket 1, Kwai Ching-hung.

7
00:02:20,375 --> 00:02:21,625
Open it.

8
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:33,500
The arrangements for Hong Kong

9
00:02:33,542 --> 00:02:35,417
contained in the agreement
are not measures of expediency.

10
00:02:35,458 --> 00:02:38,458
contained in the agreement
are not measures of expediency

11
00:02:38,542 --> 00:02:42,709
They are long-term policies which will be incorporated

12
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:45,125
in the Basic Law for Hong Kong

13
00:02:45,167 --> 00:02:50,084
and preserved intact for 50 years from 1997.

14
00:02:50,958 --> 00:02:53,375
It is in the common interests

15
00:02:53,458 --> 00:02:57,916
as well as shared responsibilities of China and Britain

16
00:02:57,958 --> 00:03:01,541
to ensure the Joint Declaration is fully
implemented with no encumbrances.

17
00:03:01,583 --> 00:03:05,375
to ensure the Joint Declaration is fully
implemented with no encumbrances.

18
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,958
An armed robbery took place this afternoon in Kwun Tong.

19
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:30,500
Four armed suspects robbed five gold shops
on Mut Wah Street.

20
00:03:30,542 --> 00:03:33,084
Four armed suspects robbed five gold shops
on Mut Wah Street.

21
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:34,208
Fuck you!

22
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:37,291
In the footage provided by our audience,

23
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:40,666
the robbers exchanged fire

24
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:42,750
with the Special Duties Unit.

25
00:03:42,792 --> 00:03:46,334
Two passersby and three policemen
were injured in the incident.

26
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:49,416
The five gold shops lost $10 million in total.

27
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:51,708
The police believe the mastermind

28
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,667
is the "Most Wanted" Yip Kwok-foon.

29
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:58,791
Bro Foon, you're unbeatable!

30
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:00,500
Bro Foon, you're unbeatable!

31
00:04:01,042 --> 00:04:03,125
But shit has hit the fan!

32
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:05,750
I told you to put more newspaper underneath!

33
00:04:05,792 --> 00:04:07,834
Look, there's blood everywhere!

34
00:04:07,917 --> 00:04:10,084
Take it, jerk!

35
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:15,208
Shit has really hit the fan!

36
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:18,583
I can give you 20% tops. Sorry.

37
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:20,125
We agreed on 40%.

38
00:04:20,167 --> 00:04:21,584
Don't you have any moral principles?

39
00:04:21,792 --> 00:04:24,125
You're paying $2M for $10M worth of swag?

40
00:04:24,167 --> 00:04:25,667
We used to get 50%!

41
00:04:25,875 --> 00:04:27,625
Now you fences are getting it all!

42
00:04:27,667 --> 00:04:29,375
We're getting shit!

43
00:04:29,458 --> 00:04:31,458
Times have changed.

44
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,042
The cops are on the prowl!

45
00:04:40,583 --> 00:04:43,458
Especially for your swag, Bro Foon!

46
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:47,167
It took us two years to fence it last time!

47
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:50,583
Stocks, real estate,
and even chestnuts are more profitable!

48
00:04:53,292 --> 00:04:55,042
Do me a favor.

49
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:56,333
40%.

50
00:04:59,042 --> 00:05:02,792
Bro Foon, you always have your way!

51
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,917
How about you find another fence?

52
00:05:09,958 --> 00:05:12,500
If I can't take it, I doubt others would dare to!

53
00:05:12,542 --> 00:05:14,125
Fuck you!

54
00:05:16,042 --> 00:05:18,042
Open the safe!

55
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:19,667
Are you robbing me?

56
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:31,500
Don't make me do it.

57
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:58,875
Thanks so much, Bro Foon.

58
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,917
Don't look me up in the future.

59
00:06:02,958 --> 00:06:04,958
There's no more business between us!

60
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:09,583
We go separate ways!

61
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:46,041
Light, Bro Foon.

62
00:07:15,208 --> 00:07:16,541
Fisherman!

63
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:27,542
Don't worry.

64
00:07:27,667 --> 00:07:29,625
These ships belong to Yi Fa.

65
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:30,917
What's Yi Fa?

66
00:07:30,958 --> 00:07:32,250
Yi Fa from Panyu, Guangzhou.

67
00:07:32,292 --> 00:07:33,792
They smuggle electric appliances.

68
00:07:34,833 --> 00:07:37,583
So pompously? So brazenly?

69
00:07:37,667 --> 00:07:41,459
They have strong backing. It's legit!

70
00:07:42,042 --> 00:07:47,834
A TV set sells for $2K
in Hong Kong and $8K in China.

71
00:07:51,417 --> 00:07:53,417
They earn millions of dollars in each transaction.

72
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:55,541
Cash keeps rolling in!

73
00:08:08,375 --> 00:08:10,417
Used notes with no consecutive serial numbers.

74
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:11,916
I need them today!

75
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:13,625
You have $80 million over there.

76
00:08:13,667 --> 00:08:17,334
I want it by 5 PM!

77
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:20,167
You go get it. I want it now!

78
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:23,625
Manager Shum, how much do we have?

79
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:25,750
Manager Fok!

80
00:08:40,625 --> 00:08:43,958
We are in love but can't be together.

81
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:52,917
I wait day by day but you never come back...

82
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:02,292
I want to forget you but you haunt my memory.

83
00:09:04,417 --> 00:09:06,042
Mr Cheuk,

84
00:09:06,125 --> 00:09:08,708
let's discuss the price.

85
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:15,833
Was it a bit flat?

86
00:09:16,792 --> 00:09:18,625
No way! Let's start over!

87
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:22,333
Red face,

88
00:09:22,792 --> 00:09:25,625
red skirt, red scarf,

89
00:09:26,542 --> 00:09:28,917
like white paper...

90
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:41,666
I said let's start over. Didn't you hear me?

91
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:47,666
I said let's start over. Didn't you hear me?

92
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:49,625
Let's not waste time!

93
00:10:05,167 --> 00:10:06,584
Mr Tycoon,

94
00:10:09,042 --> 00:10:11,792
we agreed on $3 billion.

95
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:13,458
That's final.

96
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,708
It's impossible to get so much cash
out of the blue.

97
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:19,708
I've only got $500 million on hand.

98
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:28,250
Did I say you could go?

99
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:31,125
Take the $500 million now.

100
00:10:31,167 --> 00:10:32,667
Don't get too greedy.

101
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:34,333
Then I'll give you back half of your son.

102
00:10:34,417 --> 00:10:36,959
You want the upper or lower half?

103
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,458
Do you really think I won't call the police?

104
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:43,333
Do the cops know where your son is?

105
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:48,583
All they can do is arrest and torture me.

106
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:51,333
All they can do is arrest and torture me.

107
00:10:51,375 --> 00:10:53,583
But after 48 hours, they have to release me.

108
00:10:53,625 --> 00:10:56,208
By that time, however, your son will be...

109
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:01,959
Call the Commissioner of Police!

110
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:07,541
I said let's start over. Didn't you hear me?

111
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:13,000
You hear me, or not?

112
00:11:13,042 --> 00:11:15,209
If you can't hear me with your ear,

113
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:18,000
I might as well cut it off, OK?

114
00:11:18,042 --> 00:11:21,292
Please don't!

115
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:23,708
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

116
00:11:27,917 --> 00:11:30,709
You should've said so earlier.

117
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:45,250
What's up?

118
00:11:45,292 --> 00:11:47,125
The Commissioner didn't answer?

119
00:11:57,208 --> 00:11:59,500
You're playing me, right?

120
00:11:59,542 --> 00:12:01,125
Let's play it all the way then!

121
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:19,625
Leaving so soon, Officer Wu?

122
00:12:20,292 --> 00:12:21,625
Mr Tycoon is looking for you.

123
00:12:21,792 --> 00:12:25,125
Mr Tycoon, didn't you call the cops? Come here!

124
00:12:28,292 --> 00:12:29,500
Mr Ho.

125
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:31,708
They are sending these dogs after me,

126
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,333
but they are useless.

127
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:36,708
No wonder it was easy to kidnap your son.

128
00:12:37,667 --> 00:12:39,334
So, you are willing to confess?

129
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:40,958
Officer,

130
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:44,583
if I said I'd fucked your mother,
did I really fuck her?

131
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:47,708
Shouldn't you ask Mr Ho where his son is?

132
00:12:48,917 --> 00:12:50,292
My son...

133
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:51,958
is all right.

134
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:55,042
I came here to borrow money from Mr Tycoon.

135
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:57,375
Is that a crime?

136
00:12:57,417 --> 00:12:59,834
Mr Ho, tell us if he's threatening you.

137
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:01,167
We can arrest him right away!

138
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:02,291
No, he's not.

139
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:04,416
Have you heard it loud and clear, Officer?

140
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:06,875
I said he's not threatening me!

141
00:13:08,417 --> 00:13:11,459
Calm down, Royal Hong Kong Police!

142
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:13,750
Mr Tycoon,

143
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:15,750
how much will you "lend" me?

144
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:17,500
$3 billion.

145
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:41,125
Are you in Guangzhou for business or leisure?

146
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,500
Excuse me?

147
00:13:47,625 --> 00:13:49,750
Business? Travel?

148
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:53,292
Yeah, I am a businessman.

149
00:13:59,583 --> 00:14:03,208
Guangzhou Railway Station

150
00:14:23,958 --> 00:14:25,875
I'd like to reserve a private room

151
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:30,083
at 8 PM tomorrow.

152
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:34,250
My name is Chen. Thank you.

153
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:00,500
Hello, Commander.

154
00:15:00,542 --> 00:15:02,584
8 PM tomorrow at Fengman Restaurant.

155
00:15:04,667 --> 00:15:06,917
Who the fuck am I? I'm Chiu.

156
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:08,750
Don't make me fucking wait for you.

157
00:15:08,792 --> 00:15:10,000
That's it.

158
00:15:56,083 --> 00:15:59,666
Fengman Restaurant

159
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:02,667
Almost there, Mr Fong.

160
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:03,750
OK.

161
00:16:04,667 --> 00:16:06,042
Which room?

162
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:08,167
OK. Coming.

163
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:09,583
- Take it.
- What?

164
00:16:09,625 --> 00:16:11,833
Take it. Let me put the tie on.

165
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:14,750
Da-bao. This way.

166
00:16:14,792 --> 00:16:15,500
Mr Fong.

167
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:16,667
Where's the vase?

168
00:16:17,042 --> 00:16:18,000
It's just a cheap one.

169
00:16:18,042 --> 00:16:19,417
Never mind. Let's go.

170
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:22,666
Chief Chen.

171
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:28,625
Chief Chen.

172
00:16:31,167 --> 00:16:32,917
This is Zhang Da-bao, Boss Zhang,

173
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:35,833
This is Zhang Da-bao, Boss Zhang,

174
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:37,041
who has bought Yi Fa.

175
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:39,750
This is Chief Chen from Industry and Commerce.

176
00:16:39,792 --> 00:16:41,334
We're buddies.

177
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:42,458
Nice to meet you, Chief Chen.

178
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,792
Nice to meet you.

179
00:16:44,042 --> 00:16:44,584
Let's have a drink.

180
00:16:44,667 --> 00:16:45,542
Let's drink together.

181
00:16:45,583 --> 00:16:47,500
Have a seat.

182
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,625
Bottoms up!

183
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:56,333
Boss Zhang cannot drink?

184
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:57,417
Bottoms up!

185
00:16:57,458 --> 00:16:59,125
I said bottoms up!

186
00:16:59,167 --> 00:17:00,000
Yes!

187
00:17:00,042 --> 00:17:01,667
Bottoms up!

188
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:08,042
Da-bao is my buddy.

189
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:10,750
We've only met quite recently.

190
00:17:10,792 --> 00:17:13,459
But we hit it off right away!

191
00:17:13,542 --> 00:17:14,917
Chief Chen,

192
00:17:15,792 --> 00:17:17,292
Chief Chen,

193
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:19,250
please help him.

194
00:17:19,292 --> 00:17:23,375
This vase must be expensive!

195
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:25,583
Just a modest gift.

196
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:27,125
Here's how it works:

197
00:17:27,167 --> 00:17:30,667
when Chief Chen grows tired of it,
Boss Zhang can buy it back!

198
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:33,500
It's worth at least ¥300,000!

199
00:17:35,417 --> 00:17:37,375
Didn't we agree on ¥200,000?

200
00:17:38,292 --> 00:17:39,875
I got the price wrong?

201
00:17:40,542 --> 00:17:42,584
Oh, even Homer sometimes nods.

202
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:43,792
No way!

203
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:47,041
Chief Chen is a connoisseur.

204
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:48,833
What do we know?

205
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:51,292
If Chief Chen says ¥300,000, then it's ¥300,000.

206
00:17:52,417 --> 00:17:54,292
Come get the business license tomorrow.

207
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:57,625
I'll have it nicely framed for you.

208
00:17:57,667 --> 00:17:58,834
Thanks so much, Chief Chen.

209
00:17:58,917 --> 00:18:00,625
We're buddies.

210
00:18:00,667 --> 00:18:03,417
Boss Zhang, what would you like to eat?

211
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:06,458
Braised pork with preserved vegetables.

212
00:18:07,458 --> 00:18:09,666
That's too oily for me.

213
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,208
Let me order.

214
00:18:13,458 --> 00:18:16,208
Shall we have a seafood platter?

215
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:18,000
Let me order it.

216
00:18:18,042 --> 00:18:19,292
Waiter!

217
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:21,291
Mr Zhang, best of luck with your business!

218
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:22,875
Thanks a lot.

219
00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:24,291
Cheers.

220
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:24,958
Bottoms up!

221
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:26,708
Bottoms up!

222
00:18:36,542 --> 00:18:40,334
This guy plays golf every Sunday
in Clear Water Bay.

223
00:18:40,375 --> 00:18:45,583
One-way road. Quiet. No phone signal. It may work.

224
00:18:45,667 --> 00:18:47,417
Hey! Where's our rice?

225
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:48,666
Next.

226
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,208
This one is easy.

227
00:18:51,292 --> 00:18:53,375
A super playboy.

228
00:18:53,417 --> 00:18:55,834
Drunk every night.

229
00:18:57,125 --> 00:18:59,875
He recently took an actress as a mistress.

230
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:03,750
Hey!

231
00:19:03,792 --> 00:19:04,625
Where is our rice?

232
00:19:04,708 --> 00:19:06,041
Rice? Give me a second.

233
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:07,791
Your rice is coming right away.

234
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:11,125
Sometimes he would send his driver away.

235
00:19:11,167 --> 00:19:13,209
Sorry to keep you waiting.

236
00:19:13,292 --> 00:19:14,500
Enjoy your food.

237
00:19:14,917 --> 00:19:16,167
Close the door.

238
00:19:19,792 --> 00:19:21,709
Sir, please follow me.

239
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:23,166
Give me a cup of tea.

240
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:24,666
Hey! Haven't you gone to the bathroom just now?

241
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:26,500
- Wait! Don't puke.
- Hey! The rice is cold!

242
00:19:26,542 --> 00:19:27,584
Give me a second.

243
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:29,083
- I'm sorry. The rice is cold?
- I want tea.

244
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:30,583
- Hurry up!
- Tell me the room number...

245
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:32,750
- I want tea.
- Give me a second. I'll show you the way.

246
00:19:32,792 --> 00:19:33,625
Sure, I'll get you tea.

247
00:19:33,708 --> 00:19:36,208
Give me a second. I will be right back.

248
00:19:38,833 --> 00:19:40,750
Take it easy.

249
00:19:40,792 --> 00:19:43,459
We came to China to shake off those cop dogs.

250
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,583
You went too far last time!

251
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:46,917
I live life to the full.

252
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,042
C'est la vie.

253
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:51,750
There's no other way.

254
00:19:55,417 --> 00:20:00,000
We've stolen cars, committed burglaries,

255
00:20:00,042 --> 00:20:01,417
and robbed cash vans.

256
00:20:02,417 --> 00:20:05,250
We even kidnapped the tycoon's son.

257
00:20:05,292 --> 00:20:06,792
Should we do more kidnappings?

258
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,500
What do you have in mind?

259
00:20:11,417 --> 00:20:13,459
Spit it out. We can discuss.

260
00:20:37,042 --> 00:20:39,375
I'm a mountaineer.

261
00:20:40,042 --> 00:20:41,709
After conquering one mountain,

262
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:45,375
I need to find a higher and harder mountain.

263
00:20:46,292 --> 00:20:47,875
That's it.

264
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:52,125
Before finding that mountain,

265
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:54,042
let's find the money first.

266
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:56,958
Let's keep doing it.

267
00:20:58,167 --> 00:21:00,500
Cheng, 53 years old.

268
00:21:00,542 --> 00:21:03,959
No children. His wife is in charge.

269
00:21:04,708 --> 00:21:08,250
A mobile phone used to cost over ¥10,000.
Who could afford that?

270
00:21:08,292 --> 00:21:10,959
Not everyone is a child of
a high-ranking official.

271
00:21:12,542 --> 00:21:14,667
Now the cheaper, the better.

272
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,375
We have a population of ten million.

273
00:21:18,417 --> 00:21:20,875
Say ¥1,000 a set,

274
00:21:22,792 --> 00:21:25,250
¥10,000 for ten sets.

275
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:29,000
We will be fatter than Chow Yun-fat!

276
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:33,875
Beepers are already outdated.

277
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:39,708
OK, I'll talk to you later.

278
00:21:42,833 --> 00:21:45,291
Excuse me, Boss.

279
00:21:49,083 --> 00:21:50,500
Please go on.

280
00:21:51,417 --> 00:21:54,875
Don't give us a hard time.
We're doing small business.

281
00:21:54,917 --> 00:22:00,000
Big Bro, these kids are great.

282
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:02,667
The guy who came in first
has a criminal record in Hong Kong.

283
00:22:02,708 --> 00:22:04,375
Don't know why you brought him here.

284
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:06,875
I told you to bring some decent-looking guys.

285
00:22:06,917 --> 00:22:09,625
They all look like criminals and idiots.

286
00:22:10,167 --> 00:22:13,542
You should be out of business.

287
00:22:18,708 --> 00:22:20,250
What is he staring at?

288
00:22:24,083 --> 00:22:27,583
He is smart and helpful

289
00:22:30,083 --> 00:22:31,916
I don't want the guy in blue either.

290
00:22:33,292 --> 00:22:35,167
You only need two men this time?

291
00:22:36,083 --> 00:22:38,958
Take the others to broaden their horizons.

292
00:22:44,667 --> 00:22:47,209
Got it!

293
00:22:47,417 --> 00:22:49,084
Let me see to it.

294
00:22:50,917 --> 00:22:53,959
What are you fucking looking at?

295
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,500
You, you, get lost!

296
00:22:56,542 --> 00:22:59,834
Stop drinking and scram!

297
00:22:59,875 --> 00:23:02,125
You two come with me.

298
00:23:06,167 --> 00:23:07,959
Faster.

299
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,583
So slow!

300
00:23:12,375 --> 00:23:13,667
Big Bro Chiu,

301
00:23:13,708 --> 00:23:14,750
Wang Lei.

302
00:23:14,833 --> 00:23:16,083
Hong Qi.

303
00:23:16,125 --> 00:23:17,125
Say Big Bro Chiu.

304
00:23:17,167 --> 00:23:18,084
Big Bro Chiu!

305
00:23:19,542 --> 00:23:20,459
They understand Cantonese?

306
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:23,375
Of course!

307
00:23:24,583 --> 00:23:27,500
Come have a drink.

308
00:23:27,833 --> 00:23:29,250
Spruce them up before sending them to Hong Kong.

309
00:23:29,292 --> 00:23:31,750
Sure will!

310
00:23:46,292 --> 00:23:47,542
Motherfucker.

311
00:23:47,583 --> 00:23:49,208
Sit and eat.

312
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,208
Commander,

313
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:56,042
who's this Big Bro Chiu?

314
00:23:57,375 --> 00:24:00,333
Who cares if he is Big Bro Chiu or not?

315
00:24:04,125 --> 00:24:05,667
He is a douchebag.

316
00:24:05,708 --> 00:24:07,375
He is a sly,

317
00:24:07,417 --> 00:24:09,500
old fox who changes identities.

318
00:24:10,958 --> 00:24:14,625
He looks just like Kwai Ching-hung,

319
00:24:14,667 --> 00:24:16,459
the invisible King of Thieves in Hong Kong.

320
00:24:17,292 --> 00:24:20,084
Kwai Ching-hung disappeared

321
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:21,708
after killing cops.

322
00:24:21,792 --> 00:24:24,542
Then Big Bro Chiu popped up.

323
00:24:24,583 --> 00:24:28,500
Big Bro Chiu is just a name.

324
00:24:50,083 --> 00:24:51,625
Is Fai here?

325
00:24:52,417 --> 00:24:53,959
Fai.

326
00:24:54,833 --> 00:24:55,541
What's up?

327
00:24:55,583 --> 00:24:57,250
- Someone is looking for you.
- Hey.

328
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:00,792
Bro Coke?

329
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,292
Hey!

330
00:25:02,333 --> 00:25:03,041
She's Thai?

331
00:25:03,083 --> 00:25:04,458
Noon, go buy a dozen Cokes.

332
00:25:04,542 --> 00:25:05,709
When did you come back?

333
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:06,958
Just now.

334
00:25:07,708 --> 00:25:10,250
You are too kind. Come in and have a seat.

335
00:25:10,292 --> 00:25:11,167
Did you just speak Thai?

336
00:25:11,292 --> 00:25:13,417
Do you think I speak French?

337
00:25:31,167 --> 00:25:32,334
You stink!

338
00:25:32,375 --> 00:25:33,875
Really?

339
00:25:34,083 --> 00:25:35,125
Bo.

340
00:25:35,167 --> 00:25:36,834
How can you be so rude?

341
00:25:36,917 --> 00:25:38,709
Come help set the table.

342
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:40,792
Dinner will be served soon.

343
00:25:41,583 --> 00:25:42,875
Naughty girl.

344
00:25:43,167 --> 00:25:43,959
Go wash your hands.

345
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,500
I did wash my hands.

346
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:49,500
You ate yesterday. Are you going to eat today?

347
00:25:51,083 --> 00:25:53,833
Bo, slow down. Don't rush.

348
00:25:53,875 --> 00:25:55,292
Bro, Coke.

349
00:25:57,583 --> 00:25:58,541
You want some?

350
00:25:58,583 --> 00:26:00,375
Shall we share it?

351
00:26:02,083 --> 00:26:03,000
Don't let her drink it.

352
00:26:03,042 --> 00:26:05,417
She was coughing.
I don't wanna spend money on meds.

353
00:26:05,458 --> 00:26:07,375
I wasn't coughing. I just had a fever.

354
00:26:07,417 --> 00:26:09,084
It's all right to have a sip.

355
00:26:09,167 --> 00:26:11,167
Not coughing? You are being cheeky!

356
00:26:11,208 --> 00:26:12,583
I say no Coke.
