29
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:58,791
Bro Foon, you're unbeatable!

00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:00,500
Bro Foon, you're unbeatable!

31
00:04:01,042 --> 00:04:03,125
But shit has hit the fan!

32
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:05,750
I told you to put more newspaper underneath!

33
00:04:05,792 --> 00:04:07,834
Look, there's blood everywhere!

34
00:04:07,917 --> 00:04:10,084
Take it, jerk!

35
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:15,208
Shit has really hit the fan!

00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:18,583
I can give you 20% tops. Sorry.

37
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:20,125
We agreed on 40%.

38
00:04:20,167 --> 00:04:21,584
Don't you have any moral principles?

39
00:04:21,792 --> 00:04:24,125
You're paying $2M for $10M's worth of swag?

40
00:04:24,167 --> 00:04:25,667
We used to get 50%!

41
00:04:25,875 --> 00:04:27,625
Now you fences are getting everything!

42
00:04:27,667 --> 00:04:29,375
We're getting shit!

43
00:04:29,458 --> 00:04:31,458

The cops are on the prowl!

45
00:04:40,583 --> 00:04:43,458
Especially for your swag, Bro Foon!

46
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:47,167
It took us 2 years to fence it last time!

47
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:50,583
Stocks, real estate,
and even chestnuts are more profitable!

48
00:04:53,292 --> 00:04:55,042
Do me a favor.

49
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:56,333
40%.

50
00:04:59,042 --> 00:05:02,792
Bro Foon, you always have your way!
