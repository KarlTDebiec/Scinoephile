是不是低了点儿？
Was it a bit flat?

86
00:09:16,791 --> 00:09:18,625

96
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,708
突然要那么多现金，不可能
It's impossible to get so much cash out of the blue.

97
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:19,708
我现在手上就这五亿
I've only got $500M on hand.

98
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:28,249
我有让你走开吗？
Did I say you could go?

那我先还一半儿子给你

102
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:36,958
你要上半，还是下半？

103
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,458
你真的以为我不敢报警？
Do you really think I won't call the police?

104
00:10:41,124 --> 00:10:43,333
警察知道你儿子在哪儿吗？
Do the cops know where your son is?

105
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:48,583
最多抓我回去打
All they can do is arrest and torture me.

106
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:51,333
倒吊、灌水、烧阴囊，全都玩过

四十八小时就会放了我

不过，那时候你儿子就⋯

109
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:01,958
打电话给警务处处长！
Call the Commissioner of Police!

110
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:07,541
我刚才说再唱一次，你听不见？
I said let's start over. Didn't you hear me?

111
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:13,000
那你是这样听得见？还是这样听不见？
You hear me, or not?

112
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:15,208
耳朵生来不是用来听的吗？
If you can't hear me with your ear,

113
00:11:15,249 --> 00:11:18,000
要是这样都听不见，不如切掉它，好吗？
I might as well cut if off, OK?

114
00:11:18,041 --> 00:11:21,291
不要！不要！
Please don't!

115
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:23,708
对不起，对不起！
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

116
00:11:27,916 --> 00:11:30,708
早点说，不就没事了吗？
You should've said so earlier.

117
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:45,249
怎么了？
What's up?

118
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:47,124
警务处处长不接你电话？
The Commissioner didn't answer?

119
00:11:57,208 --> 00:11:59,499
你耍我的吧？
You're playing me, right?

120
00:11:59,541 --> 00:12:01,124
我就有多大玩多大！
Let's play it all the way then!

121
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:19,625
胡警官，走这么快？
Leaving so soon, Officer Wu?

大富翁！你不是找警察吗？过来！

125
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:31,708
这群狗仔队负责跟我
They are sending these dogs after me,

126
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,333
非常无能
but they are useless.

127
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:36,708
不然怎会那么容易抓到你儿子？
No wonder it was easy to kidnap your son.

128
00:12:37,666 --> 00:12:39,333
你肯招认了？
So, you are willing to confess?

129
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:40,958
警察先生！
Officer,

130
00:12:41,249 --> 00:12:44,583
我说干了你娘就真的干了你娘吗？
if I said I'd fucked your mother, did I really fuck her?

131
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:47,708
人家的儿子在哪儿，你应问当事人
Shouldn't you ask Mr Ho where his son is?

132
00:12:48,916 --> 00:12:50,291
我儿子⋯
My son…

133
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:51,958
没事
is all right.

134
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:55,041
我今天来是找大富翁借钱
I came here to borrow money from Mr Tycoon.

135
00:12:55,166 --> 00:12:57,375
不犯法吧？
Is that a crime?

136
00:12:57,416 --> 00:12:59,833
何先生，如果有人威胁你，你说一句
Mr Ho, tell us if he's threatening you.

137
00:12:59,874 --> 00:13:01,166
马上开档案抓人！
We can arrest him right away!

138
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:02,291
没有
No, he's not.

139
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:04,416
听见吗？警察先生？
Have you heard it loud and clear, Officer?

140
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:06,874
我说没有就没有！
I said he's not threatening me!

141
00:13:08,416 --> 00:13:11,458
克制点，皇家警察！
Calm down, Royal Hong Kong Police!

142

大富翁！
Mr Tycoon,

143

陈科
Chief Chen,

咦？这个花瓶是贵价货！
This vase must be expensive!

196
00:17:23,874 --> 00:17:25,583
小小意思
Just a modest gift.

197
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:27,124
老规矩
Here's how it works:

198
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:30,666
陈科玩腻了，就让回给张总！
when Chief Chen grows tired of it, Boss Zhang can buy it back!

199
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:33,499
那至少值三十万！
It's worth at least RMB¥300K!

200
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:37,375
不是说好了二十万吗？
Didn't we agree on RMB¥200K?

201
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:39,874
我看错？
I got the price wrong?

202
00:17:40,541 --> 00:17:42,583
老猫烧须？
Oh, even Homer sometimes nods.

203
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:43,791
怎会？
No way!

204
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:47,041
说到古董，陈科才是专家
Chief Chen is a connoisseur.

205
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:48,833
我们哪会懂，对吧？
What do we know?

206
00:17:48,874 --> 00:17:51,291
陈科说三十便三十
If Chief Chen says RMB¥300K, then it's RMB¥300K.

207
00:17:52,416 --> 00:17:54,291

你以为谁都是高干子弟？
Not everyone is a child of a high-ranking official.

272

现在愈便宜愈好
Now the cheaper, the better.

273

你别难为小的了，小生意
Don't give us a hard time. We're doing small business.

287
00:22:10,166 --> 00:22:13,541
干你娘的，你该收山了
You should be out of business.

288
00:22:18,708 --> 00:22:20,249

What is he staring at?

289
00:22:24,083 --> 00:22:27,583
可是这个很聪明、很能干的
He is smart and helpful

290
00:22:30,083 --> 00:22:31,916
蓝衣那个也不要
I don't want the guy in blue either.

平常会有一辆警车在门口
Usually there's a police wagon at the entrance.

468
00:32:32,208 --> 00:32:34,083
对面街有马会
Jockey Club is across the street.

469
00:32:34,124 --> 00:32:36,291
我们在里面看紧
We keep a close eye on the police wagon.

470
00:32:36,333 --> 00:32:40,249
待八时警车离去，我们立刻动手
As soon as it leaves at 8 PM, we rob the gold shop right away.

471
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:43,249
那天跑夜马，会有好多人，搞定之后⋯
It's the racing night. It will be crowded. After it's done…

472
00:32:43,291 --> 00:32:45,541
﹣赚不了钱！　　﹣记得要跟紧我
- There's not much money in this.    - Follow me closely.

473
00:32:47,041 --> 00:32:48,166
你刚说什么？
What did you just say?

474
00:32:50,333 --> 00:32:52,416
你们做大茶饭的
You've committed big crimes.

475
00:32:52,541 --> 00:32:55,166
怎么就打劫小金行？
Why pick this small gold shop?

476
00:32:55,208 --> 00:32:56,249
对啊
Yes,

477
00:32:56,291 --> 00:32:59,583
听人家说，你们三大贼王合作
I've heard the 3 Kings of Thieves would join forces.

478
00:32:59,791 --> 00:33:02,291
没几个亿，都有几千万了
At least millions of dollars will be involved.

479
00:33:03,083 --> 00:33:04,916
什么三大贼王？
What 3 Kings of Thieves?

480
00:33:05,666 --> 00:33:07,041
说吧！
Say it!

481
00:33:08,041 --> 00:33:11,625
欢哥，你是否真的重出江湖
Bro Foon, are you making a comeback?

482
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:14,249
跟卓子强、季正雄
This time with Cheuk Tze-keung and Kwai Ching-hung.

483
00:33:14,291 --> 00:33:18,874
三大贼王合作做大案？
The 3 Kings of Thieves are collaborating?

484
00:33:19,791 --> 00:33:22,166
有人看到你们三人在大陆见面
Someone has seen you three meeting in China.

485
00:33:23,625 --> 00:33:25,249
你从哪儿听回来的？
Where did you hear this?

486
00:33:25,958 --> 00:33:27,541
外面全这么说
Everyone is saying that.

487
00:33:27,791 --> 00:33:29,333
这你也信！
And you believe it?

488
00:33:29,375 --> 00:33:33,333
老大不是说过，拿枪混不到饭吃！
Didn't Big Bro say you couldn't make money by toting guns?

489
00:33:33,958 --> 00:33:35,000
如果我是季正雄
If I'm Kwai,

490
00:33:35,041 --> 00:33:36,375
就不用和你们一起吃盒饭
I don't have to eat lunch boxes with you.

491
00:33:38,166 --> 00:33:39,708
蠢货
Idiots.

492
00:33:42,166 --> 00:33:43,708
神经病
That's ridiculous!

493
00:33:43,958 --> 00:33:45,583
一个「砰！砰！砰！」
Yip is all noise and fury.

494
00:33:45,625 --> 00:33:47,291
一个鬼鬼祟祟
Kwai is hush and shush.

495
00:33:47,333 --> 00:33:49,541
三个风格不一样，搞什么？
We are so different. How can it work?

496
00:33:49,708 --> 00:33:51,750
跟我走私多些电器
Smuggle more goods with me.

497
00:33:51,791 --> 00:33:53,625
一起赚到笑！
Let's make more money together!

498
00:33:54,708 --> 00:33:55,916
收到
Got it.

499
00:33:56,041 --> 00:33:57,124
英明！
Brilliant!

500
00:33:57,166 --> 00:34:01,208
有时心痒，也想重拾枪杆
Sometimes I feel like toting my gun again.

501
00:34:01,249 --> 00:34:02,874
打劫！打劫！
Robbery! Robbery!

502
00:34:02,916 --> 00:34:04,000
多威风！
That's so cool!

503
00:34:04,041 --> 00:34:05,375
你这叫威风？
You call that cool?

504
00:34:05,874 --> 00:34:07,958
老大开AK才威风！
Big Bro wielding AK-47 is cool!

505
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:10,166
不是这样开
Not like this.

506
00:34:10,666 --> 00:34:12,166
AK后座力大
AK-47 recoil is powerful.

507
00:34:12,208 --> 00:34:13,458
不是托着
Don't hold it.

508
00:34:13,499 --> 00:34:14,583
而是按着
Press it.

509
00:34:14,625 --> 00:34:15,583
站稳马步
Stand firm.

510
00:34:15,625 --> 00:34:17,333
射他老子
Shoot the hell out of him.

511
00:34:27,083 --> 00:34:30,249
怎么了？跟就跟
What the fuck?! Join me

512
00:34:31,333 --> 00:34:33,291
不跟就回去吃屎
or go home and eat shit.

513
00:34:37,083 --> 00:34:39,666
潮哥，那⋯
Big Bro Chiu,

514
00:34:40,083 --> 00:34:43,708
我们打个小金行，能赚多少钱？
how much can we earn from robbing this gold shop?

515
00:34:50,625 --> 00:34:51,416
打不打电话？
You're calling or not?

516
00:34:51,458 --> 00:34:55,333
你们觉得，如果三大贼王合作
If the 3 Kings of Thieves join forces,

517
00:34:55,375 --> 00:34:57,166
就算开「鱼蛋档」
even if we open a fish ball stall together,

518
00:34:57,208 --> 00:34:59,583
也很轰动吧？
we will create a stir, right?

519
00:35:00,041 --> 00:35:02,000
起什么名字好呢？
What shall I call our stall?

520
00:35:02,041 --> 00:35:03,291
打不打电话？
Are you calling your family or not?

521
00:35:21,375 --> 00:35:23,041
不要睡！
Hey, wake up!

522
00:35:25,416 --> 00:35:26,625
金库？
Gold depository?

523
00:35:27,166 --> 00:35:28,416
马场？
Racecourse?

524
00:35:33,249 --> 00:35:35,208
绑架彭定康？
Kidnap Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten?

525
00:35:35,249 --> 00:35:37,124
鲁平？
The Head of Hong Kong and Macau Affairs, Lu Ping?

526
00:35:37,666 --> 00:35:38,874
不行
No way.

527
00:36:01,291 --> 00:36:02,333
搞什么？
What are you listening?

528
00:36:02,416 --> 00:36:04,458
四大天王同台演出
The 4 Heavenly Kings singing on stage together.

529
00:36:04,499 --> 00:36:05,791

What are they singing?

530
00:36:07,625 --> 00:36:09,833
唱什么也听不到，有什么好听？
I can't hear a thing. What's so good about it?

533
00:36:16,249 --> 00:36:18,958
我要水，水！
Water, give me water.

534
00:36:19,249 --> 00:36:22,166
我肯打了，我打了
I will make the call.

535
00:36:34,458 --> 00:36:36,458
我丈夫怎么样？我求求你！
How's my husband? I beg you!

536

他身体不好，别为难他

你别以为我们很有钱，只是表面风光
We are not as loaded as it may seem.

538

卓先生，你怎么才肯放过我丈夫？
Mr Cheuk, can you let my husband go?

要不这样，我有八千万现金
I have $80M in cash.

00:36:59,375 --> 00:37:00,666
全给你好吗？
Is it OK?

00:37:00,958 --> 00:37:02,375

混蛋，又不是你招呼那些官！

吃吃喝喝也埋怨？
Don't complain about carousing,

668
00:44:37,249 --> 00:44:38,750
看在钱的份上
for money's sake.

叫你派线人到警察局找季正雄的档案
Your mole hasn't found Kwai's dossier

680
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,375
还没找到？

681
00:47:47,958 --> 00:47:51,416
那么叶国欢潜逃回大陆，还没找到？
No news about Yip in China?

682
00:47:54,708 --> 00:47:57,249
以前跟他混的那些手下、销赃那些呢？
What about his underlings? His fences?

683
00:47:57,291 --> 00:48:00,833
一块儿偷渡来的？同乡呢？
His fellow illegal immigrants? His village mates?

684
00:48:01,208 --> 00:48:02,750
也找不到？
Can't find them?

685
00:48:03,958 --> 00:48:05,291

去你妈的！
Fuck you!

690

警察悬红一百多万
The cops have offered a $1M reward on him.

691
00:48:31,416 --> 00:48:32,916
这么多年都没消息
But there's no news over these years.

692
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,499
你再给我一点时间
Give me some time.

693
00:48:35,541 --> 00:48:37,666
悬红可以考虑
Reward money is a good idea.

694
00:48:39,166 --> 00:48:41,666
警察出一百多万，我就出一千万！
The cops offer $1M; I'll up it to $10M!

谁报料，谁就有钱收

那么张扬？警察一定窃听

699
00:48:53,458 --> 00:48:55,458
你们三个贼王聚在一起
Those assholes will prevent the 3 Kings from meeting up.

700
00:48:55,499 --> 00:48:57,166
那群混蛋一定拦路的

701
00:48:57,541 --> 00:48:59,083
未必
Not necessarily.

702
00:48:59,708 --> 00:49:01,708
警察不知多想找到他们
The cops want them too.

703
00:49:01,750 --> 00:49:03,958
肯定派很多人来打听
They will send loads of people after us.

704
00:49:04,791 --> 00:49:07,041
想想怎么甩掉他们吧

705

脱衣服

714
00:49:59,458 --> 00:50:02,791
季正雄，跟他合作过一次，很普通
I worked with Kwai once. He's so average.

715
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:06,708
叶国欢，我认识他，住在海陆丰那个

716
00:50:06,750 --> 00:50:07,916
季正雄本名是邢镇南

717

就这样了
OK.

720
00:50:32,791 --> 00:50:35,666
我当过叶国欢司机，被警察追
I drove for Yip and was chased by the cops.

721
00:50:35,708 --> 00:50:37,166
叶国欢的货，也是我销的
I fenced for Yip.

722
00:50:37,208 --> 00:50:38,666
叶国欢打劫时我也在现场的
I was present in Yip's every heist.

723
00:50:38,708 --> 00:50:39,708
大家都一起开AK
We wielded AK-47 together.

724
00:50:39,750 --> 00:50:42,375
卓老板，我好羡慕你，你所有新闻我都看过
Mr Cheuk, I envy you. I admire all your works.

725
00:50:42,416 --> 00:50:44,874
叶国欢曾光顾过我
Yip bought sex from me.

726
00:50:44,916 --> 00:50:47,541
他那时粗声粗气，很厉害的
He was loud and proud.

727
00:50:49,874 --> 00:50:52,708
打劫？香港仔？
Heists? Hong Kong kids?

728
00:50:52,833 --> 00:50:55,958
打架最在行，鬼祟又没胆

00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:00,666
旗兵，是鼎爷我第一个引入的，知道吗？

730
00:51:01,249 --> 00:51:04,041
打劫前，最重要教他们什么？
What did I teach them before a heist?

731
00:51:04,083 --> 00:51:06,083
道义两个字！
Moral principle!

732
00:51:06,124 --> 00:51:08,166
省港旗兵之父
Father of the Chinese retired soldiers,

733
00:51:08,208 --> 00:51:09,583
进入正题没有？
can you cut to the chase?

734
00:51:09,666 --> 00:51:11,874
你究竟认识叶国欢，还是季正雄？
Do you know Yip or Kwai?

735
00:51:11,916 --> 00:51:14,791
别打断老子讲话
Don't interrupt me when I talk.

736
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,333
说得快你又听不懂！

00:51:19,791 --> 00:51:21,291
道义两个字

我有一次，带大圈文、湖南鬼、潮州威
I once brought 3 Mainlanders

740
00:51:26,249 --> 00:51:30,208
跟警察驳火的时候，「砰！砰！砰！」
to a showdown with the cops. Bang!

741
00:51:30,249 --> 00:51:33,041
潮州威吓得枪都掉了！
One of them, Wei, was so scared he dropped his gun!

742
00:51:33,166 --> 00:51:36,041
你知道吗？是我冲过去救他的！
You know what? I rushed to save him!

743
00:51:36,083 --> 00:51:39,666
所以他欠我很多，知道吗？
He owes me a lot.

744
00:51:40,458 --> 00:51:42,458
知道昆西是谁吗？
Know who Kun-xi is?

745
00:51:45,416 --> 00:51:47,041
叶国欢以前的老大？
Yip's former boss?

746
00:51:48,583 --> 00:51:51,583
就是潮州威的干儿子
Quincy is Wei's godson.

747
00:51:51,625 --> 00:51:53,083
想见他吗？
Want to meet him?

748
00:51:54,166 --> 00:51:55,416
一百万！

750
00:51:58,541 --> 00:52:00,499

00:52:00,916 --> 00:52:02,499
一百万而已
It's just $1M.

752
00:52:03,083 --> 00:52:04,458
但是要快
Act fast.

753

带你去逛街好吗？

怎么了，台山仔，最近手头很紧？
Are you tight in cash lately, Taishan Boy?

759
00:52:55,249 --> 00:52:58,041
三根枪够用了吗？
How can 3 pieces be enough?

760
00:53:07,666 --> 00:53:12,208
枪不是用来嗅的，是用来开的
Guns are for firing, not for sniffing.

761
00:53:18,916 --> 00:53:22,333
长官教我们：安全第一
Our commander taught us: safety first.

762
00:53:22,958 --> 00:53:24,416
那你嗅这么久
Have you sniffed that Cheuk is looking for Yip and Kwai?

有否嗅到卓子强，在找叶国欢和季正雄？
Have you sniffed that Cheuk is looking for Yip and Kwai?

768
00:53:43,333 --> 00:53:45,291
他们二人很危险的
Both of them are very dangerous.

769
00:53:45,874 --> 00:53:48,791
不危险，怎么做大哥？
Which kingpin is not dangerous?

770
00:53:48,833 --> 00:53:50,874

They are being so brazen?

00:53:52,583 --> 00:53:55,375
就是快回归才要干一次大的

773
00:53:55,458 --> 00:53:59,541
回归之后，连饭也不给你吃，蠢货
After the Handover, it will be slim pickings, Idiot.

774
00:54:00,958 --> 00:54:02,291
这样吧
Listen.

775
00:54:02,333 --> 00:54:03,666
你替我打听一下
Sniff out their whereabouts.

776
00:54:03,708 --> 00:54:07,416
我喝茶、吃饭、装修也全靠你了！
The restoration of this Association depends on you!

777
00:54:08,249 --> 00:54:12,333
老弟，有消息就告诉我
Keep me posted, kiddo.

778
00:54:12,375 --> 00:54:15,124
有消息就告诉我
Keep me posted!

779
00:54:28,750 --> 00:54:29,666
先生，请站住
Stand still, sir.

780
00:54:29,750 --> 00:54:30,791
什么事？

金哥、忠哥，其实那些官

939
01:07:40,916 --> 01:07:42,916
你们都相熟了吧？

947
01:07:58,375 --> 01:07:59,833

操！本想可以一战成名，光宗耀祖
Fuck! Thought I would be famous overnight.

950
01:08:14,416 --> 01:08:15,833
白来一趟
What a waste of time!

951
01:08:18,083 --> 01:08:19,916
扬不扬名不是问题
Fame is not an issue.

952
01:08:19,958 --> 01:08:22,874
来到这儿，一个钱也没得分就回去
I can't just go back empty-handed.

953
01:08:22,916 --> 01:08:25,041
还在这儿啃面包
Not to mention having to chew this bread here.

954
01:08:33,249 --> 01:08:34,750
潮哥
Big Bro Chiu,

总不能，就这样回去吧？
We can't just go back like this.

957
01:08:48,166 --> 01:08:51,333
潮哥，真要我们回去吗？
Big Bro Chiu, you really want us to leave?

958
01:08:55,124 --> 01:08:57,166
你们要是真有什么大茶饭的话
If you guys have something big in mind,

959
01:08:57,208 --> 01:08:59,000

你说是潮哥就是潮哥吧
If you say you're Big Bro Chiu, then so be it.

我知道的了，您放心

964
01:09:11,249 --> 01:09:14,958
规矩我懂，一定不会跟别人乱说话的

965
01:09:15,416 --> 01:09:17,541

分了它
Share it.

967

说真的，我们可以的
Seriously, we can make it work.

968

你们三大贼王合作⋯
The 3 Kings of Thieves join forces…

969
01:10:26,083 --> 01:10:28,791
多管闲事
Mind your own business.

970
01:10:28,833 --> 01:10:30,499
知道这么多干吗？
Mind your own business.

971
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
不是要洗肾吗？还抽烟？

都说你狗改不了吃屎
Old habits die hard.

973
01:11:10,916 --> 01:11:13,083
不是还生气吧？
Are you still angry with me?

974
01:11:13,124 --> 01:11:15,833
你们想打劫楼下的金行吗？
You're planning to rob the gold shop downstairs?

975
01:11:21,541 --> 01:11:23,750
还以为你真的来探我
I thought you're paying me a visit.

976
01:11:24,333 --> 01:11:26,249
原来贪我这里方便
You're here just for the location.

977
01:11:27,666 --> 01:11:28,291
你听我说
Listen to me…

978
01:11:28,333 --> 01:11:29,375
还有什么好说？
No more!

979
01:11:29,416 --> 01:11:29,833
先听我讲完
Listen to me…

980
01:11:29,874 --> 01:11:31,291
我当你是兄弟，你当我是凯子啊！
I treat you as my brother. You treat me as a fool!

981
01:11:31,333 --> 01:11:31,916
我没当你是凯子
I never treat you as a fool.

982
01:11:31,958 --> 01:11:34,124
算了，不用说了！
Forget it! Just shut up!

983
01:11:35,958 --> 01:11:38,499
我现在有妻有女

你不要来搞我家人好吗？
Can you leave my family alone?

986
01:11:56,166 --> 01:11:57,958
这次是老大不对
I'm in the wrong this time.

987
01:12:03,083 --> 01:12:05,583
你也知道现在赚钱不易
You know it's hard to make a living.

988
01:12:14,666 --> 01:12:16,416
大家好兄弟
We're sworn brothers.

989
01:12:17,958 --> 01:12:19,791
这次是我欠你的
I owe you this time.

990
01:12:23,041 --> 01:12:25,958
这几天的事就算是粉笔字，抹了它
Forget what happened these past few days.

991
01:12:27,041 --> 01:12:28,750
不要对人说
Keep it to yourself.

992
01:12:50,916 --> 01:12:52,541
老大明天一早就走
I'll leave early tomorrow morning.

993
01:12:52,833 --> 01:12:54,791
总之你不会再见到我
You won't see me again.

久仰大名
I've heard so much about you.

1000

卓老板，一路上来辛苦了

1004
01:15:12,916 --> 01:15:15,083
待会带你吃点好的洗尘
I'll treat you to something special.

1005
01:15:15,124 --> 01:15:17,874
我们这里的虾蛄、咸蟹很有特色

1006
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:21,249
吃完找两个发花帮你洗头

Where's Yip?

1011
01:15:34,041 --> 01:15:37,499
外面那辆货车，还有一吨炸药
The truck outside holds a ton of dynamite.

1012
01:15:38,208 --> 01:15:39,666
砰！
Bang!

1013
01:15:39,750 --> 01:15:41,249
炸什么都行！
You can blow up whatever you want.

1014
01:15:42,291 --> 01:15:44,208
叶国欢啊！
Where's Yip?

1015
01:15:49,583 --> 01:15:51,375

老大，再考虑一下
Big Bro, let's think it through.

为何要走回头路？
Why go back to our old business?

1024
01:16:22,708 --> 01:16:23,791
你教我做事？
Are you lecturing me?

1025
01:16:23,833 --> 01:16:25,666
能赚钱啊！
We're making money!

1026
01:16:25,750 --> 01:16:27,458
以前那种活，不能混一世
We can't be robbers for the rest of our lives!

1027
01:16:27,499 --> 01:16:29,333
你去做吧！
You do it!

1028
01:16:29,375 --> 01:16:31,124
你跟船家都谈好吧！
You have struck a deal with the Fisherman!

1029

老大，他只是想想罢了
Big Bro, he was just thinking out loud.

1030
01:16:34,625 --> 01:16:35,874
要走就走
Leave if you want!

1031
01:16:35,958 --> 01:16:37,249
我不阻人发达！
I won't stop you!

1032
01:16:37,291 --> 01:16:39,208
现在几点？不用睡啊？
Do you know what time it is? You don't sleep?

1033
01:16:39,249 --> 01:16:41,124
拜山再说！
Go fuck yourself!

1034
01:16:42,666 --> 01:16:44,000
去你妈的！
Fuck you!

1035
01:16:44,124 --> 01:16:45,041
下来！
Come down!

1036
01:17:00,333 --> 01:17:02,499
那家伙收山了
Yip has retired!

1037
01:17:02,541 --> 01:17:04,208
他以前跟我的！
He used to be my man!

1038
01:17:04,249 --> 01:17:05,291
跟我合作不更好？
Am I not a better partner?

1039
01:17:05,333 --> 01:17:07,625
你是谁啊？
Who the hell are you?

1040
01:17:12,499 --> 01:17:13,208
喂？
Hello?

1041

01:17:20,291 --> 01:17:21,375
不会吧？
Are you kidding me?

1044
01:17:22,208 --> 01:17:23,833
你说是就是呀？
Why should I believe you?

1045
01:17:23,874 --> 01:17:25,958
我叶国欢有麟有角！
I am who I am!

1046
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:27,708
不信我们见个面吧！
If you don't believe me, let's meet up!

1047
01:17:29,041 --> 01:17:30,458
你先等等
Wait. Got another call.

上去！
Go up!

1055
01:17:43,083 --> 01:17:44,166
上去！
Go up!

1056
01:17:46,375 --> 01:17:47,333
喂？
Hello?

1057
01:17:47,958 --> 01:17:49,166
说话啊！
Speak!

1058
01:17:49,708 --> 01:17:51,375
是不是卓子强？
Are you Cheuk?

1059
01:17:52,208 --> 01:17:53,166
谁？
Who's speaking?

1060
01:17:59,208 --> 01:18:00,666
季正雄
Kwai Ching-hung.

1061
01:18:03,124 --> 01:18:04,708
要我帮忙吗？
Need my help?

1062
01:18:06,124 --> 01:18:07,708
不会吧！
Are you kidding me?

1063
01:18:09,458 --> 01:18:11,499
你说是就是了？
Do you have any proof?

1064
01:18:12,416 --> 01:18:15,249
86年油麻地东盛表行是我做的
I robbed Tung Shing Watch in 1986.

1065
01:18:16,041 --> 01:18:17,499
88年，旺角金太子门口
I killed 3 plainclothes

1066
01:18:17,541 --> 01:18:19,208
三个便衣探员是我杀的

还有92年置地广场⋯

01:18:22,041 --> 01:18:25,625
92年置地广场是叶国欢干的吧！
Wasn't it Yip who robbed Landmark in 1992!

1069
01:18:28,041 --> 01:18:30,124
别人说你就信

也是我干的
I did them all.

1072
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
你以为只有他有AK吗？
Do you think only Yip had AK-47?

1073
01:18:38,041 --> 01:18:40,708
他老哥爱上镜，警察又笨
He loved to be on camera and the cops were dumb.

1074
01:18:40,750 --> 01:18:43,958
﹣我只好顺水推舟⋯　　﹣你等一会！别挂啊
- I just took advantage of the situation…    - Hold on! Don't hang up.

1075
01:18:56,499 --> 01:18:57,791
刚刚最后一句你说什么？
What did you just say?

1076
01:18:57,833 --> 01:18:58,625
去你妈的！
Fuck you!

1077

耍我啊？
Are you playing me?

就是你，叶国欢！
It's you, Yip!

92年置地、94年珍宝、前年好运佳
Landmark in 1992, Jumbo in 1994, and Lucky Guy two years ago.

1080
01:19:09,791 --> 01:19:10,583
也是你干的？
Are you responsible for all?

1081
01:19:10,625 --> 01:19:11,625
不是！
No!

1082
01:19:11,666 --> 01:19:12,666
我要遮遮掩掩？
I never did my jobs in clandestine!

1083
01:19:12,833 --> 01:19:15,458
鬼鬼祟祟？见不了人啊？
Why should I hide myself?

1084
01:19:50,750 --> 01:19:51,708
人齐了
We're all here.

1085

01:20:25,208 --> 01:20:26,208
