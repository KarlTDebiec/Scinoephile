突然要那么多现金，不可能
It's impossible to get so much cash out of the blue.

97

我现在手上就这五亿
I've only got $500M on hand.

98
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:30,083
我有让你走开吗？

103
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:41,292
你真的以为我不敢报警？

104
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:45,167
警察知道你儿子在哪儿吗？
Do the cops know where your son is?

105
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:50,208
最多抓我回去打
All they can do is arrest and torture me.

106
00:10:50,208 --> 00:10:53,208
倒吊、灌水、烧阴囊，全都玩过

四十八小时就会放了我

不过，那时候你儿子就⋯

109
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:03,792
打电话给警务处处长！
Call the Commissioner of Police!

110
00:11:06,792 --> 00:11:09,375
我刚才说再唱一次，你听不见？
I said let's start over. Didn't you hear me?

111
00:11:11,542 --> 00:11:14,875
那你是这样听得见？还是这样听不见？
You hear me, or not?

112
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:17,083
耳朵生来不是用来听的吗？
If you can't hear me with your ear,

113
00:11:17,083 --> 00:11:19,875
要是这样都听不见，不如切掉它，好吗？
I might as well cut it off, OK?

114
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:23,208
不要！不要！
Please don't!

115
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:25,542
对不起，对不起！
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

116
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:32,542
早点说，不就没事了吗？
You should've said so earlier.

117
00:11:45,667 --> 00:11:47,125
怎么了？
What's up?

118
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:48,958
警务处处长不接你电话？
The Commissioner didn't answer?

119
00:11:59,042 --> 00:12:01,375
你耍我的吧？
You're playing me, right?

120
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:02,958
我就有多大玩多大！
Let's play it all the way then!

121
00:12:19,417 --> 00:12:21,458
胡警官，走这么快？
Leaving so soon, Officer Wu?

大富翁！你不是找警察吗？过来！

125
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:33,583
这群狗仔队负责跟我
They are sending these dogs after me,

126
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:35,167
非常无能
but they are useless.

127
00:12:35,417 --> 00:12:38,542
不然怎会那么容易抓到你儿子？
No wonder it was easy to kidnap your son.

128
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,167
你肯招认了？
So, you are willing to confess?

129
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:42,792
警察先生！
Officer,

130
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:46,458
我说干了你娘就真的干了你娘吗？
if I said I'd fucked your mother, did I really fuck her?

131
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:49,542
人家的儿子在哪儿，你应问当事人
Shouldn't you ask Mr Ho where his son is?

132
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,125
我儿子⋯
My son…

133
00:12:52,417 --> 00:12:53,792
没事
is all right.

134
00:12:54,458 --> 00:12:57,000
我今天来是找大富翁借钱
I came here to borrow money from Mr Tycoon.

135
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,250
不犯法吧？
Is that a crime?

136
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:01,708
何先生，如果有人威胁你，你说一句
Mr Ho, tell us if he's threatening you.

137
00:13:01,708 --> 00:13:03,000
马上开档案抓人！
We can arrest him right away!

138
00:13:03,417 --> 00:13:04,167
没有
No, he's not.

139

听见吗？警察先生？
Have you heard it loud and clear, Officer?

140
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:08,708
我说没有就没有！
I said he's not threatening me!

141
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:13,292
克制点，皇家警察！
Calm down, Royal Hong Kong Police!

咦？这个花瓶是贵价货！

196
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:27,417
小小意思
Just a modest gift.

197
00:17:27,667 --> 00:17:29,000
老规矩
Here's how it works:

198
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,583
陈科玩腻了，就让回给张总！
when Chief Chen grows tired of it, Boss Zhang can buy it back!

199
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:35,333
那至少值三十万！
It's worth at least RMB¥300K!

不是说好了二十万吗？
Didn't we agree on RMB¥200K?

201
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:41,708
我看错？
I got the price wrong?

202
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:44,458
老猫烧须？
Oh, even Homer sometimes nods.

203
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:45,667
怎会？
No way!

204
00:17:45,667 --> 00:17:48,917
说到古董，陈科才是专家
Chief Chen is a connoisseur.

205
00:17:48,917 --> 00:17:50,708
我们哪会懂，对吧？

206
00:17:50,708 --> 00:17:53,125
陈科说三十便三十
If Chief Chen says RMB¥300K, then it's RMB¥300K.

207

288
00:22:20,542 --> 00:22:22,083

What is he staring at?

00:22:25,917 --> 00:22:29,417
可是这个很聪明、很能干的
He is smart and helpful

290
00:22:31,917 --> 00:22:33,750

00:32:31,958 --> 00:32:34,042
平常会有一辆警车在门口
Usually there's a police wagon at the entrance.

469
00:32:34,042 --> 00:32:35,958
对面街有马会
Jockey Club is across the street.

470
00:32:35,958 --> 00:32:38,167
我们在里面看紧
We keep a close eye on the police wagon.

471
00:32:38,167 --> 00:32:42,083
待八时警车离去，我们立刻动手
As soon as it leaves at 8pm, we rob the gold shop right away.

472
00:32:42,583 --> 00:32:45,125
那天跑夜马，会有好多人，搞定之后⋯
It's the racing night. It will be crowded. After it's done…

473
00:32:45,125 --> 00:32:47,375
赚不了钱！　　记得要跟紧我
- There's not much money in this.    - Follow me closely.

474
00:32:48,875 --> 00:32:50,000
你刚说什么？
What did you just say?

475
00:32:52,167 --> 00:32:54,375
你们做大茶饭的
You've committed big crimes.

476
00:32:54,375 --> 00:32:57,042
怎么就打劫小金行？
Why pick this small gold shop?

477
00:32:57,042 --> 00:32:58,125
对啊
Yes,

478
00:32:58,125 --> 00:33:01,417
听人家说，你们三大贼王合作
I've heard the 3 Kings of Thieves would join forces.

479
00:33:01,625 --> 00:33:04,125
没几个亿，都有几千万了
At least millions of dollars will be involved.

480
00:33:04,917 --> 00:33:06,750
什么三大贼王？
What 3 Kings of Thieves?

481
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:08,875
说吧！
Say it!

482
00:33:09,875 --> 00:33:13,583
欢哥，你是否真的重出江湖
Bro Foon, are you making a comeback?

483
00:33:13,583 --> 00:33:16,125
跟卓子强、季正雄
This time with Cheuk Tze-keung and Kwai Ching-hung.

484
00:33:16,125 --> 00:33:20,708
三大贼王合作做大案？
The 3 Kings of Thieves are collaborating?

485
00:33:21,625 --> 00:33:24,000
有人看到你们三人在大陆见面
Someone has seen you three meeting in China.

486
00:33:25,458 --> 00:33:27,083
你从哪儿听回来的？
Where did you hear this?

487
00:33:27,792 --> 00:33:29,375
外面全这么说
Everyone is saying that.

488
00:33:29,625 --> 00:33:31,208
这你也信！
And you believe it?

489
00:33:31,208 --> 00:33:35,167
老大不是说过，拿枪混不到饭吃！
Didn't Big Bro say you couldn't make money by toting guns?

490
00:33:35,792 --> 00:33:36,875
如果我是季正雄
If I'm Kwai,

491
00:33:36,875 --> 00:33:38,208
就不用和你们一起吃盒饭
I don't have to eat lunch boxes with you.

492
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,542
蠢货
Idiots.

493
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,542
神经病
That's ridiculous!

494
00:33:45,792 --> 00:33:47,458
一个「砰！砰！砰！」
Yip is all noise and fury.

495
00:33:47,458 --> 00:33:49,167
一个鬼鬼祟祟
Kwai is hush and shush.

496
00:33:49,167 --> 00:33:51,375
三个风格不一样，搞什么？
We are so different. How can it work?

497
00:33:51,542 --> 00:33:53,625
跟我走私多些电器
Smuggle more goods with me.

498
00:33:53,625 --> 00:33:55,458
一起赚到笑！
Let's make more money together!

499
00:33:56,542 --> 00:33:57,875
收到
Got it.

500
00:33:57,875 --> 00:33:59,000
英明！
Brilliant!

501
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:03,083
有时心痒，也想重拾枪杆
Sometimes I feel like toting my gun again.

502
00:34:03,083 --> 00:34:04,750
打劫！打劫！
Robbery! Robbery!

503
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:05,875
多威风！
That's so cool!

504
00:34:05,875 --> 00:34:07,208
你这叫威风？
You call that cool?

505
00:34:07,708 --> 00:34:09,792
老大开AK才威风！
Big Bro wielding AK-47 is cool!

506
00:34:10,583 --> 00:34:12,000
不是这样开
Not like this.

507
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:14,042
AK后座力大
AK-47 recoil is powerful.

508
00:34:14,042 --> 00:34:15,333
不是托着
Don't hold it.

509
00:34:15,333 --> 00:34:16,458
而是按着
Press it.

510
00:34:16,458 --> 00:34:17,458
站稳马步
Stand firm.

511
00:34:17,458 --> 00:34:19,167
射他老子
Shoot the hell out of him.

512
00:34:28,917 --> 00:34:32,083
怎么了？跟就跟
What the fuck?! Join me

513
00:34:33,167 --> 00:34:35,125
不跟就回去吃屎
or go home and eat shit.

514
00:34:38,917 --> 00:34:41,500
潮哥，那⋯
Big Bro Chiu,

515
00:34:41,917 --> 00:34:45,542
我们打个小金行，能赚多少钱？
how much can we earn from robbing this gold shop?

516
00:34:52,458 --> 00:34:53,292
打不打电话？
You're calling or not?

517
00:34:53,292 --> 00:34:57,208
你们觉得，如果三大贼王合作
If the 3 Kings of Thieves join forces,

518
00:34:57,208 --> 00:34:59,042
就算开「鱼蛋档」
even if we open a fish ball stall together,

519
00:34:59,042 --> 00:35:01,417
也很轰动吧？
we will create a stir, right?

520
00:35:01,875 --> 00:35:03,875
起什么名字好呢？
What shall I call our stall?

521
00:35:03,875 --> 00:35:05,125
打不打电话？
Are you calling your family or not?

522
00:35:23,208 --> 00:35:24,875
不要睡！
Hey, wake up!

523
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:28,458
金库？
Gold depository?

524
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,250
马场？
Racecourse?

525
00:35:35,083 --> 00:35:37,083
绑架彭定康？
Kidnap Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten?

526
00:35:37,083 --> 00:35:38,958
鲁平？
The Head of Hong Kong and Macau Affairs, Lu Ping?

527
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:40,708
不行
No way.

528
00:36:03,125 --> 00:36:04,250
搞什么？
What are you listening to?

529
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:06,333
四大天王同台演出
The 4 Heavenly Kings singing on stage together.

530
00:36:06,333 --> 00:36:07,625
唱什么歌？
What are they singing?

531
00:36:09,458 --> 00:36:11,667
唱什么也听不到，有什么好听？
I can't hear a thing. What's so good about it?

四大天王破天荒第一次合唱
When the 4 Heavenly Kings sing together,

533
00:36:14,042 --> 00:36:15,958

it's terrific no matter what they sing.

534
00:36:18,083 --> 00:36:20,792
我要水，水！
Water, give me water.

535
00:36:21,083 --> 00:36:24,000
我肯打了，我打了
I will make the call.

536
00:36:36,292 --> 00:36:38,333
我丈夫怎么样？我求求你！
How's my husband? I beg you!

537
00:36:38,333 --> 00:36:40,708
他身体不好，别为难他
He's not in good health. Don't hurt him.

538

你别以为我们很有钱，只是表面风光
We are not as loaded as it may seem.

539

卓先生，你怎么才肯放过我丈夫？
Mr Cheuk, can you let my husband go?

要不你开个价，我自己掏腰包⋯

要不这样，我有八千万现金
I have $80M in cash.

543
00:37:01,208 --> 00:37:02,500
全给你好吗？
Is it OK?

00:37:02,792 --> 00:37:04,250

混蛋，又不是你招呼那些官！

吃吃喝喝也埋怨？
Don't complain about carousing,

669
00:44:39,083 --> 00:44:40,583
看在钱的份上
for money's sake.

叫你派线人到警察局找季正雄的档案
Your mole hasn't found Kwai's dossier

681
00:47:41,833 --> 00:47:43,208
还没找到？

682
00:47:49,792 --> 00:47:53,250
那么叶国欢潜逃回大陆，还没找到？
No news about Yip in China?

683
00:47:56,542 --> 00:47:59,125
以前跟他混的那些手下、销赃那些呢？
What about his underlings? His fences?

684
00:47:59,125 --> 00:48:02,667
一块儿偷渡来的？同乡呢？
His fellow illegal immigrants? His village mates?

685
00:48:03,042 --> 00:48:04,583
也找不到？
Can't find them?

686
00:48:05,792 --> 00:48:07,125

去你妈的！

去你妈的！
Fuck you!

691

警察悬红一百多万
The cops have offered a $1M reward on him.

00:48:33,250 --> 00:48:34,833
这么多年都没消息
But there's no news over these years.

693
00:48:34,833 --> 00:48:37,375
你再给我一点时间
Give me some time.

694
00:48:37,375 --> 00:48:39,500
悬红可以考虑
Reward money is a good idea.

695
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,542
警察出一百多万，我就出一千万！
The cops offer $1M; I'll up it to $10M!

谁报料，谁就有钱收

那么张扬？警察一定窃听

700
00:48:55,292 --> 00:48:57,146
你们三个贼王聚在一起
Those assholes will prevent the 3 Kings from meeting up.

701
00:48:57,146 --> 00:48:59,000
那群混蛋一定拦路的

702
00:48:59,375 --> 00:49:00,917
未必
Not necessarily.

703
00:49:01,542 --> 00:49:03,583
警察不知多想找到他们
The cops want them too.

704
00:49:03,583 --> 00:49:05,792
肯定派很多人来打听
They will send loads of people after us.

705
00:49:06,625 --> 00:49:08,875
想想怎么甩掉他们吧
Find a way to shake them off.

706

脱衣服

715
00:50:01,292 --> 00:50:04,667
季正雄，跟他合作过一次，很普通
I worked with Kwai once. He's so average.

716
00:50:04,667 --> 00:50:08,583
叶国欢，我认识他，住在海陆丰那个

717
00:50:08,583 --> 00:50:09,875
季正雄本名是邢镇南

718

Yes.

720
00:50:13,583 --> 00:50:14,292
就这样了
OK.

721
00:50:34,625 --> 00:50:37,542
我当过叶国欢司机，被警察追
I drove for Yip and was chased by the cops.

722
00:50:37,542 --> 00:50:39,000
叶国欢的货，也是我销的
I fenced for Yip.

723
00:50:39,042 --> 00:50:40,500
叶国欢打劫时我也在现场的
I was present in Yip's every heist.

724
00:50:40,542 --> 00:50:41,542
大家都一起开AK
We wielded AK-47s together.

725
00:50:41,583 --> 00:50:44,250
卓老板，我好羡慕你，你所有新闻我都看过
Mr Cheuk, I envy you. I admire all your works.

726
00:50:44,250 --> 00:50:46,750
叶国欢曾光顾过我
Yip bought sex from me.

727
00:50:46,750 --> 00:50:49,375
他那时粗声粗气，很厉害的
He was loud and proud.

728
00:50:51,708 --> 00:50:54,667
打劫？香港仔？
Heists? Hong Kong kids?

729
00:50:54,667 --> 00:50:57,833
打架最在行，鬼祟又没胆

00:50:57,833 --> 00:51:02,500
旗兵，是鼎爷我第一个引入的，知道吗？
I imported the Chinese retired soldiers to Hong Kong.

731
00:51:03,083 --> 00:51:05,917
打劫前，最重要教他们什么？
What did I teach them before a heist?

732
00:51:05,917 --> 00:51:07,958
道义两个字！
Moral principle!

733
00:51:07,958 --> 00:51:10,042
省港旗兵之父
Father of the Chinese retired soldiers,

734
00:51:10,042 --> 00:51:11,500
进入正题没有？
can you cut to the chase?

735
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:13,750
你究竟认识叶国欢，还是季正雄？
Do you know Yip or Kwai?

736

别打断老子讲话
Don't interrupt me when I talk.

737
00:51:16,833 --> 00:51:19,167

00:51:21,625 --> 00:51:23,167
道义两个字

我有一次，带大圈文、湖南鬼、潮州威

741
00:51:28,083 --> 00:51:32,083
跟警察驳火的时候，「砰！砰！砰！」
to a showdown with the cops. Bang!

742
00:51:32,083 --> 00:51:35,000
潮州威吓得枪都掉了！
One of them, Wei, was so scared he dropped his gun!

743
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,917
你知道吗？是我冲过去救他的！
You know what? I rushed to save him!

744
00:51:37,917 --> 00:51:41,500
所以他欠我很多，知道吗？
He owes me a lot.

745
00:51:42,292 --> 00:51:44,292
知道昆西是谁吗？
Know who Kun-xi is?

746
00:51:47,250 --> 00:51:48,875
叶国欢以前的老大？
Yip's former boss?

747
00:51:50,417 --> 00:51:53,458
就是潮州威的干儿子
Quincy is Wei's godson.

748
00:51:53,458 --> 00:51:54,917
想见他吗？
Want to meet him?

749
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,250
一百万！

750

You better check him out thoroughly.

751
00:52:00,375 --> 00:52:02,333

00:52:02,750 --> 00:52:04,333
一百万而已
It's just $1M.

753
00:52:04,917 --> 00:52:06,292

Act fast.

754

怎么了，台山仔，最近手头很紧？
Are you tight in cash lately, Taishan Boy?

760
00:52:57,083 --> 00:52:59,875
三根枪够用了吗？
How can 3 pieces be enough?

761
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:14,042
枪不是用来嗅的，是用来开的
Guns are for firing, not for sniffing.

762
00:53:20,750 --> 00:53:24,167
长官教我们：安全第一
Our commander taught us: safety first.

763
00:53:24,792 --> 00:53:27,479
那你嗅这么久
Have you sniffed out that Cheuk is looking for Yip and Kwai?

有否嗅到卓子强，在找叶国欢和季正雄？
Have you sniffed out that Cheuk is looking for Yip and Kwai?

769

他们二人很危险的
Both of them are very dangerous.

770

不危险，怎么做大哥？
Which kingpin is not dangerous?

771
00:53:50,667 --> 00:53:52,750

就是快回归才要干一次大的

774
00:53:57,292 --> 00:54:01,375
回归之后，连饭也不给你吃，蠢货
After the Handover, it will be slim pickings, Idiot.

775
00:54:02,792 --> 00:54:04,167
这样吧
Listen.

776
00:54:04,167 --> 00:54:05,542
你替我打听一下
Sniff out their whereabouts.

777
00:54:05,542 --> 00:54:09,250
我喝茶、吃饭、装修也全靠你了！
The restoration of this Association depends on you!

778
00:54:10,083 --> 00:54:14,208
老弟，有消息就告诉我
Keep me posted, kiddo.

779
00:54:14,208 --> 00:54:16,958
有消息就告诉我
Keep me posted!

780
00:54:30,583 --> 00:54:31,583
先生，请站住
Stand still, sir.

781
00:54:31,583 --> 00:54:32,667
什么事？

惨了，这次倾家荡产入货

金哥、忠哥，其实那些官

940
01:07:42,750 --> 01:07:44,750
你们都相熟了吧？
and connections well…

01:07:44,917 --> 01:07:46,333
你说什么？

没有
No.

948
01:08:00,208 --> 01:08:01,708
拿来！

950
01:08:11,708 --> 01:08:15,833
操！本想可以一战成名，光宗耀祖
Fuck! Thought I would be famous overnight.

951
01:08:16,250 --> 01:08:17,667
白来一趟
What a waste of time!

952
01:08:19,917 --> 01:08:21,792
扬不扬名不是问题
Fame is not an issue.

953
01:08:21,792 --> 01:08:24,750
来到这儿，一个钱也没得分就回去
I can't just go back empty-handed.

954
01:08:24,750 --> 01:08:26,875
还在这儿啃面包
Not to mention having to chew this bread here.

955
01:08:35,083 --> 01:08:36,625
潮哥
Big Bro Chiu,

956
01:08:36,625 --> 01:08:39,000
我们来到香港也不容易

总不能，就这样回去吧？
We can't just go back like this.

958
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:53,167
潮哥，真要我们回去吗？
Big Bro Chiu, you really want us to leave?

959
01:08:56,958 --> 01:08:59,042
你们要是真有什么大茶饭的话
If you guys have something big in mind,

960
01:08:59,042 --> 01:09:00,917

我很能守秘密的

01:09:07,917 --> 01:09:10,375
你说是潮哥就是潮哥吧
If you say you're Big Bro Chiu, then so be it.

964

我知道的了，您放心
I understand. Don't worry.

965
01:09:13,083 --> 01:09:16,792
规矩我懂，一定不会跟别人乱说话的
I know the rules. It's between you and me.

966
01:09:17,250 --> 01:09:19,375
我们也是讲义气的嘛

967
01:09:33,167 --> 01:09:34,417
分了它
Share it.

968
01:09:47,917 --> 01:09:49,625
说真的，我们可以的
Seriously, we can make it work.

969
01:09:49,625 --> 01:09:51,208
你们三大贼王合作⋯
The 3 Kings of Thieves join forces…

970
01:10:27,917 --> 01:10:30,125
多管闲事
Mind your own business.

971
01:10:30,125 --> 01:10:32,333
知道这么多干吗？
Mind your own business.

972
01:11:00,833 --> 01:11:02,833
不是要洗肾吗？还抽烟？
Aren't you on dialysis? Still smoking?

都说你狗改不了吃屎
Old habits die hard.

974
01:11:12,750 --> 01:11:14,958
不是还生气吧？
Are you still angry with me?

975
01:11:14,958 --> 01:11:17,667
你们想打劫楼下的金行吗？
You're planning to rob the gold shop downstairs?

976
01:11:23,375 --> 01:11:25,583
还以为你真的来探我
I thought you're paying me a visit.

977
01:11:26,167 --> 01:11:28,083
原来贪我这里方便
You're here just for the location.

978
01:11:29,500 --> 01:11:30,167
你听我说
Listen to me…

979
01:11:30,167 --> 01:11:31,250
还有什么好说？
No more!

980
01:11:31,250 --> 01:11:31,708
先听我讲完
Listen to me…

981
01:11:31,708 --> 01:11:33,167
我当你是兄弟，你当我是凯子啊！
I treat you as my brother. You treat me as a fool!

982
01:11:33,167 --> 01:11:33,792
我没当你是凯子
I never treat you as a fool.

983
01:11:33,792 --> 01:11:35,958
算了，不用说了！
Forget it! Just shut up!

984
01:11:37,792 --> 01:11:40,333
我现在有妻有女

01:11:40,875 --> 01:11:43,208
生活过得很好
My life is great.

你不要来搞我家人好吗？
Can you leave my family alone?

987
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:59,792
这次是老大不对
I'm in the wrong this time.

988
01:12:04,917 --> 01:12:07,417
你也知道现在赚钱不易
You know it's hard to make a living.

989
01:12:16,500 --> 01:12:18,250
大家好兄弟
We're sworn brothers.

990
01:12:19,792 --> 01:12:21,625
这次是我欠你的
I owe you this time.

991
01:12:24,875 --> 01:12:27,792
这几天的事就算是粉笔字，抹了它
Forget what happened these past few days.

992
01:12:28,875 --> 01:12:30,583
不要对人说
Keep it to yourself.

993
01:12:52,750 --> 01:12:54,375
老大明天一早就走
I'll leave early tomorrow morning.

994
01:12:54,667 --> 01:12:56,625
总之你不会再见到我
You won't see me again.

995
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:17,750
可乐叔叔
Uncle Coke.

996
01:13:20,708 --> 01:13:22,125

卓老板
Mr Cheuk,

01:14:57,333 --> 01:14:59,125
久仰大名
I've heard so much about you.

1001
01:15:03,083 --> 01:15:04,333

1004

卓老板，一路上来辛苦了
Mr  Cheuk. How was your journey?

1005
01:15:14,750 --> 01:15:16,958
待会带你吃点好的洗尘
I'll treat you to something special.

1006
01:15:16,958 --> 01:15:19,833
我们这里的虾蛄、咸蟹很有特色
Shrimps and crabs are local specialties.

1007
01:15:19,833 --> 01:15:23,125
吃完找两个发花帮你洗头
After food we'll find two shampoo girls for you.

1008
01:15:23,125 --> 01:15:25,167

1011
01:15:32,542 --> 01:15:33,958
叶国欢呢？
Where's Yip?

1012
01:15:35,875 --> 01:15:39,333
外面那辆货车，还有一吨炸药
The truck outside holds a ton of dynamite.

1013
01:15:40,042 --> 01:15:41,583
砰！
Bang!

1014
01:15:41,583 --> 01:15:43,083
炸什么都行！
You can blow up whatever you want.

1015
01:15:44,125 --> 01:15:46,042
叶国欢啊！
Where's Yip?

1016
01:15:51,417 --> 01:15:53,250
全都部队出身
They were all retired soldiers.

1017
01:15:53,250 --> 01:15:54,833
胆大包天，身经百战！
They're fearless veterans in battles!

1018

我要叶国欢！
I want Yip!

1019
01:16:01,833 --> 01:16:03,083
零钱！

老大，再考虑一下
Big Bro, let's think it through.

1022
01:16:18,542 --> 01:16:20,042
拿来！
Give it to me!

01:16:20,625 --> 01:16:21,542
现在也不错
We're doing all right.

1024
01:16:21,542 --> 01:16:23,583
为何要走回头路？
Why go back to our old business?

1025
01:16:24,542 --> 01:16:25,667
你教我做事？
Are you lecturing me?

1026
01:16:25,667 --> 01:16:27,583
能赚钱啊！
We're making money!

1027
01:16:27,583 --> 01:16:29,333
以前那种活，不能混一世
We can't be robbers for the rest of our lives!

1028
01:16:29,333 --> 01:16:31,208
你去做吧！
You do it!

1029
01:16:31,208 --> 01:16:32,958
你跟船家都谈好吧！
You have struck a deal with the Fisherman!

1030
01:16:34,125 --> 01:16:36,458
老大，他只是想想罢了
Big Bro, he was just thinking out loud.

1031
01:16:36,458 --> 01:16:37,792
要走就走
Leave if you want!

1032
01:16:37,792 --> 01:16:39,125
我不阻人发达！
I won't stop you!

1033
01:16:39,125 --> 01:16:41,083
现在几点？不用睡啊？
Do you know what time it is? You don't sleep?

1034
01:16:41,083 --> 01:16:42,958
拜山再说！
Go fuck yourself!

1035
01:16:44,500 --> 01:16:45,958
去你妈的！
Fuck you!

1036
01:16:45,958 --> 01:16:46,875
下来！
Come down!

1037
01:17:02,167 --> 01:17:04,375
那家伙收山了
Yip has retired!

1038
01:17:04,375 --> 01:17:06,083
他以前跟我的！
He used to be my man!

1039
01:17:06,083 --> 01:17:07,167
跟我合作不更好？
Am I not a better partner?

1040
01:17:07,167 --> 01:17:09,458
你是谁啊？
Who the hell are you?

1041
01:17:14,333 --> 01:17:15,083
喂？
Hello?

1042
01:17:15,083 --> 01:17:16,917
喂，卓子强
Hello, Cheuk.

我是叶国欢
It's Yip Kwok-foon speaking.

1044
01:17:22,125 --> 01:17:23,208
不会吧？
Are you kidding me?

1045
01:17:24,042 --> 01:17:25,708
你说是就是呀？
Why should I believe you?

1046
01:17:25,708 --> 01:17:27,833
我叶国欢有麟有角！
I am who I am!

1047
01:17:27,833 --> 01:17:29,542
不信我们见个面吧！
If you don't believe me, let's meet up!

1048
01:17:30,875 --> 01:17:32,333
你先等等
Wait. Got another call.

1049
01:17:32,333 --> 01:17:33,000
去你妈的！
Fuck you!

1050
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:34,417
等什么？喂？
Wait for what? Hello?

1051
01:17:34,958 --> 01:17:35,667
喂？
Hello?

1052

喂！
Hey!

1054
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:43,083
你死定了！
You are dead!

1055
01:17:43,500 --> 01:17:44,750
上去！
Go up!

1056
01:17:44,917 --> 01:17:46,000
上去！
Go up!

1057
01:17:48,208 --> 01:17:49,167
喂？
Hello?

1058
01:17:49,792 --> 01:17:51,000
说话啊！
Speak!

1059
01:17:51,542 --> 01:17:53,208
是不是卓子强？
Are you Cheuk?

1060
01:17:54,042 --> 01:17:55,000
谁？
Who's speaking?

1061
01:18:01,042 --> 01:18:02,500
季正雄
Kwai Ching-hung.

1062
01:18:04,958 --> 01:18:06,542
要我帮忙吗？
Need my help?

1063
01:18:07,958 --> 01:18:09,542
不会吧！
Are you kidding me?

1064
01:18:11,292 --> 01:18:13,333
你说是就是了？
Do you have any proof?

1065
01:18:14,250 --> 01:18:17,083
86年油麻地东盛表行是我做的
I robbed Tung Shing Watch in 1986.

1066
01:18:17,875 --> 01:18:19,375
88年，旺角金太子门口
I killed 3 plainclothes

1067
01:18:19,375 --> 01:18:21,042
三个便衣探员是我杀的
in 1988.

1068
01:18:21,333 --> 01:18:22,625
还有92年置地广场⋯
And Landmark in 1992…

1069
01:18:23,875 --> 01:18:27,458
92年置地广场是叶国欢干的吧！
Wasn't it Yip who robbed Landmark in 1992!

1070
01:18:29,875 --> 01:18:31,958
别人说你就信
Don't be so gullible.

1071
01:18:32,583 --> 01:18:36,083
94年珍宝表行、前年好运佳
Jumbo Watch in 1994 and Lucky Guy Jewellery two years ago.

1072
01:18:36,083 --> 01:18:37,833
也是我干的
I did them all.

1073
01:18:37,833 --> 01:18:39,875
你以为只有他有AK吗？
Do you think only Yip had an AK-47?

1074
01:18:39,875 --> 01:18:42,583
他老哥爱上镜，警察又笨
He loved to be on camera and the cops were dumb.

1075
01:18:42,583 --> 01:18:45,792
我只好顺水推舟⋯　　你等一会！别挂啊
- I just took advantage of the situation…    - Hold on! Don't hang up.

1076
01:18:58,333 --> 01:18:59,667
刚刚最后一句你说什么？
What did you just say?

1077
01:18:59,667 --> 01:19:00,500
去你妈的！
Fuck you!

1078
01:19:00,500 --> 01:19:01,250
耍我啊？
Are you playing me?

1079
01:19:03,417 --> 01:19:06,250
就是你，叶国欢！
It's you, Yip!

1080
01:19:08,458 --> 01:19:11,625
92年置地、94年珍宝、前年好运佳
Landmark in 1992, Jumbo in 1994, and Lucky Guy two years ago.

1081
01:19:11,625 --> 01:19:12,458
也是你干的？
Are you responsible for all?

1082
01:19:12,458 --> 01:19:13,500
不是！
No!

1083
01:19:13,500 --> 01:19:14,500
我要遮遮掩掩？
I never did my jobs clandestinely!

1084
01:19:14,667 --> 01:19:17,292
鬼鬼祟祟？见不了人啊？
Why should I hide myself?

1085
01:19:52,583 --> 01:19:53,542
人齐了
We're all here.

1086
01:19:53,792 --> 01:19:54,750
你现在在哪？
Where are you right now?

1087
01:19:54,750 --> 01:19:56,125

Hong Kong!

1088
01:19:57,417 --> 01:19:59,292
好，回香港再联络
I'll call you when I'm back in Hong Kong.

1089
01:20:22,792 --> 01:20:23,792
喂？
Hello?

1090
01:20:27,042 --> 01:20:28,042
喂？
Hello?

1091
01:20:33,375 --> 01:20:34,542
喂？
Hello?

1092
01:20:34,542 --> 01:20:36,625
季正雄，你还在吗？
Kwai Ching-hung, you still there?

1093
01:20:37,292 --> 01:20:37,917
喂？
