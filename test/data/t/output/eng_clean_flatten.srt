1
00:01:58,791 --> 00:02:00,458
Police.

2
00:02:00,499 --> 00:02:02,416
Show me your ID.

3
00:02:08,458 --> 00:02:10,375
- Check his ID.    - Yes sir.

4
00:02:11,083 --> 00:02:12,833
- What's in your bag?    - Headquarters,

5
00:02:12,874 --> 00:02:17,166
- Let me see.    - Please verify ID number C532743…

6
00:02:17,208 --> 00:02:18,791
Bracket 1, Kwai Ching-hung.

7
00:02:20,375 --> 00:02:21,625
Open it.

8
00:02:31,249 --> 00:02:33,499
The arrangements for Hong Kong

9
00:02:33,541 --> 00:02:35,416
contained in the agreement are not measures of expediency.

10
00:02:35,458 --> 00:02:38,458
contained in the agreement are not measures of expediency.

11
00:02:38,541 --> 00:02:42,708
They are long-term policies which will be incorporated

12
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:45,124
in the Basic Law for Hong Kong

13
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:50,083
and preserved intact for 50 years from 1997.

14
00:02:50,958 --> 00:02:53,375
It is the common interests

15
00:02:53,458 --> 00:02:57,916
as well as shared responsibilities of China and Britain

16
00:02:57,958 --> 00:03:01,541
to ensure the Joint Declaration is fully implemented with no encumbrances.

17
00:03:01,583 --> 00:03:05,375
to ensure the Joint Declaration is fully implemented with no encumbrances.

18
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,958
An armed robbery took place this afternoon in Kwun Tong.

19
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:30,499
4 armed suspects robbed 5 gold shops on Mut Wah Street.

20
00:03:30,541 --> 00:03:33,083
4 armed suspects robbed 5 gold shops on Mut Wah Street.

21
00:03:33,124 --> 00:03:34,208
Fuck you!

22
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:37,291
In the footage provided by our audience,

23
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:40,666
the robbers exchanged fire

24
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:42,750
with the Special Duties Unit.

25
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:46,333
2 passersby and 3 policemen were injured in the incident.

26
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:49,416
The 5 gold shops lost $10M in total.

27
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:51,708
The police believe the mastermind

28
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,666
is the "Most Wanted" Yip Kwok-foon.

29
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:58,791
Bro Foon, you're unbeatable!

30
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:00,499
Bro Foon, you're unbeatable!

31
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:03,124
But shit has hit the fan!

32
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:05,750
I told you to put more newspaper underneath!

33
00:04:05,791 --> 00:04:07,833
Look, there's blood everywhere!

34
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:10,083
Take it, jerk!

35
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:15,208
Shit has really hit the fan!

36
00:04:15,249 --> 00:04:18,583
I can give you 20% tops. Sorry.

37
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:20,124
We agreed on 40%.

38
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:21,583
Don't you have moral principle?

39
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:24,124
You're paying $2M for $10M worth of swag?

40
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:25,666
We used to get 50%!

41
00:04:25,874 --> 00:04:27,625
Now you fences are getting it all!

42
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:29,375
We're getting shit!

43
00:04:29,458 --> 00:04:31,458
Times have changed.

44
00:04:31,499 --> 00:04:34,041
The cops are on the prowl!

45
00:04:40,583 --> 00:04:43,458
Especially for your swag, Bro Foon!

46
00:04:43,499 --> 00:04:47,166
It took us 2 years to fence it last time!

47
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:50,583
Stocks, real estate, and even chestnuts are more profitable!

48
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:55,041
Do me a favor.

49
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:56,333
40%.

50
00:04:59,041 --> 00:05:02,791
Bro Foon, you always have your way!

51
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,916
How about you find another fence?

52
00:05:09,958 --> 00:05:12,499
If I can't take it, I doubt others would dare to!

53
00:05:12,541 --> 00:05:14,124
Fuck you!

54
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:18,041
Open the safe!

55
00:05:18,249 --> 00:05:19,666
Are you robbing me?

56
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:31,499
Don't make me do it.

57
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:58,874
Thanks so much, Bro Foon.

58
00:06:00,499 --> 00:06:02,916
Don't look me up in the future.

59
00:06:02,958 --> 00:06:04,958
There's no more business between us!

60
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:09,583
We go separate ways!

61
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:46,041
Light, Bro Foon.

62
00:07:15,208 --> 00:07:16,541
Fisherman!

63
00:07:26,249 --> 00:07:27,541
Don't worry.

64
00:07:27,666 --> 00:07:29,625
These ships belong to Yi Fa.

65
00:07:30,124 --> 00:07:30,916
What's Yi Fa?

66
00:07:30,958 --> 00:07:32,249
Yi Fa from Panyu, Guangzhou.

67
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:33,791
They smuggle electric appliances.

68
00:07:34,833 --> 00:07:37,583
So pompously? So brazenly?

69
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:41,458
They have strong backing. It's legit!

70
00:07:42,041 --> 00:07:47,833
A TV set sells for $2K in Hong Kong and $8K in China.

71
00:07:51,416 --> 00:07:53,416
They earn millions of dollars in each transaction.

72
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:55,541
Cash keeps rolling in!

73
00:08:08,375 --> 00:08:10,416
Used notes with no consecutive serial numbers.

74
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:11,916
I need them today!

75
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:13,625
You have $80M over there.

76
00:08:13,666 --> 00:08:17,333
I want it by 5 PM!

77
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:20,166
You go get it. I want it now!

78
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:23,625
Manager Shum, how much do we have?

79
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:25,750
Manager Fok!

80
00:08:40,625 --> 00:08:43,958
We are in love but can't be together.

81
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:52,916
I wait day by day but you never come back…

82
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:02,291
I want to forget you but you haunt my memory.

83
00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:06,041
Mr Cheuk,

84
00:09:06,124 --> 00:09:08,708
let's discuss the price.

85
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:15,833
Was it a bit flat?

86
00:09:16,791 --> 00:09:18,625
No way! Let's start over!

87
00:09:20,124 --> 00:09:22,333
Red face,

88
00:09:22,791 --> 00:09:25,625
red skirt, red scarf,

89
00:09:26,541 --> 00:09:28,916
like white paper…

90
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:41,666
I said let's start over. Didn't you hear me?

91
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:47,666
I said let's start over. Didn't you hear me?

92
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:49,625
Let's not waste time!

93
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:06,583
Mr Tycoon,

94
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:11,791
we agreed on $3 billion.

95
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:13,458
That's final.

96
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,708
It's impossible to get so much cash out of the blue.

97
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:19,708
I've only got $500M on hand.

98
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:28,249
Did I say you could go?

99
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:31,124
Take the $500M now.

100
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:32,666
Don't get too greedy.

101
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:34,333
Then I'll give you back half of your son.

102
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:36,958
You want the upper or lower half?

103
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,458
Do you really think I won't call the police?

104
00:10:41,124 --> 00:10:43,333
Do the cops know where your son is?

105
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:48,583
All they can do is arrest and torture me.

106
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:51,333
All they can do is arrest and torture me.

107
00:10:51,375 --> 00:10:53,583
But after 48 hours, they have to release me.

108
00:10:53,625 --> 00:10:56,208
By that time, however, you son will be…

109
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:01,958
Call the Commissioner of Police!

110
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:07,541
I said let's start over. Didn't you hear me?

111
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:13,000
You hear me, or not?

112
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:15,208
If you can't hear me with your ear,

113
00:11:15,249 --> 00:11:18,000
I might as well cut if off, OK?

114
00:11:18,041 --> 00:11:21,291
Please don't!

115
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:23,708
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

116
00:11:27,916 --> 00:11:30,708
You should've said so earlier.

117
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:45,249
What's up?

118
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:47,124
The Commissioner didn't answer?

119
00:11:57,208 --> 00:11:59,499
You're playing me, right?

120
00:11:59,541 --> 00:12:01,124
Let's play it all the way then!

121
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:19,625
Leaving so soon, Officer Wu?

122
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:21,625
Mr Tycoon is looking for you.

123
00:12:21,791 --> 00:12:25,124
Mr Tycoon, didn't you call the cops? Come here!

124
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:29,499
Mr Ho.

125
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:31,708
They are sending these dogs after me,

126
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,333
but they are useless.

127
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:36,708
No wonder it was easy to kidnap your son.

128
00:12:37,666 --> 00:12:39,333
So, you are willing to confess?

129
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:40,958
Officer,

130
00:12:41,249 --> 00:12:44,583
if I said I'd fucked your mother, did I really fuck her?

131
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:47,708
Shouldn't you ask Mr Ho where his son is?

132
00:12:48,916 --> 00:12:50,291
My son…

133
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:51,958
is all right.

134
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:55,041
I came here to borrow money from Mr Tycoon.

135
00:12:55,166 --> 00:12:57,375
Is that a crime?

136
00:12:57,416 --> 00:12:59,833
Mr Ho, tell us if he's threatening you.

137
00:12:59,874 --> 00:13:01,166
We can arrest him right away!

138
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:02,291
No, he's not.

139
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:04,416
Have you heard it loud and clear, Officer?

140
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:06,874
I said he's not threatening me!

141
00:13:08,416 --> 00:13:11,458
Calm down, Royal Hong Kong Police!

142
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:13,750
Mr Tycoon,

143
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:15,750
how much will you "lend" me?

144
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:17,499
$3 billion.

145
00:13:39,249 --> 00:13:41,124
Are you in Guangzhou for business or leisure?

146
00:13:44,499 --> 00:13:45,499
Excuse me?

147
00:13:47,625 --> 00:13:49,750
Business? Travel?

148
00:13:51,249 --> 00:13:53,291
Yea, I am a businessman.

149
00:13:59,583 --> 00:14:03,208
Guangzhou Railway Station

150
00:14:23,958 --> 00:14:25,874
I'd like to reserve a private room

151
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:30,083
at 8 PM tomorrow.

152
00:14:31,166 --> 00:14:34,249
My name is Chen. Thank you.

153
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:00,499
Hello, Commander.

154
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:02,583
8 PM tomorrow at Fengman Restaurant.

155
00:15:04,666 --> 00:15:06,916
Who the fuck am I? I'm Chiu.

156
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:08,750
Don't make me fucking wait for you.

157
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:10,000
That's it.

158
00:15:56,083 --> 00:15:59,666
Fengman Restaurant

159
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:02,666
Almost there, Mr Fong.

160
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:03,750
OK.

161
00:16:04,666 --> 00:16:06,041
Which room?

162
00:16:06,249 --> 00:16:08,166
OK. Coming.

163
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:09,583
- Take it.    - What?

164
00:16:09,625 --> 00:16:11,833
Take it. Let me put the tie on.

165
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:14,750
Da-bao. This way.

166
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:15,499
Mr Fong.

167
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:16,666
Where's the vase?

168
00:16:17,041 --> 00:16:18,000
It's just a cheap one.

169
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:19,416
Never mind. Let's go.

170
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:22,666
Chief Chen.

171
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:28,625
Chief Chen.

172
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:32,916
This is Zhang Da-bao, Boss Zhang,

173
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:35,833
This is Zhang Da-bao, Boss Zhang,

174
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:37,041
who has bought Yi Fa.

175
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:39,750
This is Chief Chen from Industry and Commerce.

176
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:41,333
We're buddies.

177
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:42,458
Nice to meet you, Chief Chen.

178
00:16:42,499 --> 00:16:43,791
Nice to meet you.

179
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:44,583
Let's have a drink.

180
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:45,541
Let's drink together.

181
00:16:45,583 --> 00:16:47,499
Have a seat.

182
00:16:49,499 --> 00:16:50,625
Bottoms up!

183
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:56,333
Boss Zhang cannot drink?

184
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:57,416
Bottoms up!

185
00:16:57,458 --> 00:16:59,124
I said bottoms up!

186
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:00,000
Yes!

187
00:17:00,041 --> 00:17:01,666
Bottoms up!

188
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:08,041
Da-bao is my buddy.

189
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:10,750
We've only met quite recently.

190
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:13,458
But we hit it off right away!

191
00:17:13,541 --> 00:17:14,916
Chief Chen,

192
00:17:15,791 --> 00:17:17,291
Chief Chen,

193
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:19,249
please help him.

194
00:17:19,291 --> 00:17:23,375
This vase must be expensive!

195
00:17:23,874 --> 00:17:25,583
Just a modest gift.

196
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:27,124
Here's how it works:

197
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:30,666
when Chief Chen grows tired of it, Boss Zhang can buy it back!

198
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:33,499
It's worth at least RMB¥300K!

199
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:37,375
Didn't we agree on RMB¥200K?

200
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:39,874
I got the price wrong?

201
00:17:40,541 --> 00:17:42,583
Oh, even Homer sometimes nods.

202
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:43,791
No way!

203
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:47,041
Chief Chen is a connoisseur.

204
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:48,833
What do we know?

205
00:17:48,874 --> 00:17:51,291
If Chief Chen says RMB¥300K, then it's RMB¥300K.

206
00:17:52,416 --> 00:17:54,291
Come get the business license tomorrow.

207
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:57,625
I'll have it nicely framed for you.

208
00:17:57,666 --> 00:17:58,833
Thanks so much, Chief Chen.

209
00:17:58,916 --> 00:18:00,625
We're buddies.

210
00:18:00,666 --> 00:18:03,416
Boss Zhang, what would you like to eat?

211
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:06,458
Braised pork with preserved vegetables.

212
00:18:07,458 --> 00:18:09,666
That's too oily for me.

213
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,208
Let me order.

214
00:18:13,458 --> 00:18:16,208
Shall we have a seafood platter?

215
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:18,000
Let me order it.

216
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:19,291
Waiter!

217
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:21,291
Mr Zhang, best of luck with your business!

218
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:22,874
Thanks a lot.

219
00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:24,291
Cheers.

220
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:24,958
Bottoms up!

221
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:26,708
Bottoms up!

222
00:18:36,541 --> 00:18:40,333
This guy plays golf every Sunday in Clear Water Bay.

223
00:18:40,375 --> 00:18:45,583
One-way road. Quiet. No phone signal. It may work.

224
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:47,416
Hey! Where's our rice?

225
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:48,666
Next.

226
00:18:49,499 --> 00:18:51,208
This one is easy.

227
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:53,375
A super playboy.

228
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:55,833
Drunk every night.

229
00:18:57,124 --> 00:18:59,874
He recently has an actress as a mistress.

230
00:19:02,874 --> 00:19:03,750
Hey!

231
00:19:03,791 --> 00:19:04,625
Where is our rice?

232
00:19:04,708 --> 00:19:06,041
Rice? Give me a second.

233
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:07,791
Your rice is coming right away.

234
00:19:09,249 --> 00:19:11,124
Sometimes he would send his driver away.

235
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:13,208
Sorry to keep you waiting.

236
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:14,499
Enjoy your food.

237
00:19:14,916 --> 00:19:16,166
Close the door.

238
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:21,708
Sir, please follow me.

239
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:23,166
Give me a cup of tea.

240
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:24,666
Hey! Haven't you gone to the bathroom just now?

241
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:26,499
- Wait! Don't puke.    - Hey! The rice is cold!

242
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:27,583
Give me a second.

243
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:29,083
- I'm sorry. The rice is cold?    - I want tea.

244
00:19:29,124 --> 00:19:30,583
- Hurry up!    - Tell me the room number…

245
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:32,750
- I want tea.    - Give me a second. I'll show you the way.

246
00:19:32,791 --> 00:19:33,625
Sure, I'll get you tea.

247
00:19:33,708 --> 00:19:36,208
Give me a second. I will be right back.

248
00:19:38,833 --> 00:19:40,750
Take it easy.

249
00:19:40,791 --> 00:19:43,458
We came to China to shake off those cop dogs.

250
00:19:43,499 --> 00:19:44,583
You went too far last time!

251
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:46,916
I live life to the full.

252
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,041
C'est la vie.

253
00:19:50,124 --> 00:19:51,750
There's no other way.

254
00:19:55,416 --> 00:20:00,000
We've stolen cars, committed burglaries,

255
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:01,416
and robbed cash vans.

256
00:20:02,416 --> 00:20:05,249
We even kidnapped the tycoon's son.

257
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:06,791
Should we do more kidnappings?

258
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,499
What do you have in mind?

259
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:13,458
Spit it out. We can discuss.

260
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:39,375
I'm a mountaineer.

261
00:20:40,041 --> 00:20:41,708
After conquering one mountain,

262
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:45,375
I need to find a higher and harder mountain.

263
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:47,874
That's it.

264
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:52,124
Before finding that mountain,

265
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:54,041
let's find the money first.

266
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:56,958
Let's keep doing it.

267
00:20:58,166 --> 00:21:00,499
Cheng, 53 years old.

268
00:21:00,541 --> 00:21:03,958
No children. His wife is in charge.

269
00:21:04,708 --> 00:21:08,249
A mobile phone used to cost over RMB¥10K. Who could afford that?

270
00:21:08,291 --> 00:21:10,958
Not everyone is a child of a high-ranking official.

271
00:21:12,541 --> 00:21:14,666
Now the cheaper, the better.

272
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,375
We have a population of 10 million.

273
00:21:18,416 --> 00:21:20,874
Say RMB¥1K a set,

274
00:21:22,791 --> 00:21:25,249
RMB¥10K for 10 sets.

275
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:29,000
We will be fatter than Chow Yun-fat!

276
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:33,874
Beepers are already outdated.

277
00:21:35,124 --> 00:21:39,708
OK, I'll talk to you later.

278
00:21:42,833 --> 00:21:45,291
Excuse me, Boss.

279
00:21:49,083 --> 00:21:50,499
Please go on.

280
00:21:51,416 --> 00:21:54,874
Don't give us a hard time. We're doing small business.

281
00:21:54,916 --> 00:22:00,000
Big Bro, these kids are great.

282
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:02,666
The guy who came in first has criminal record in Hong Kong.

283
00:22:02,708 --> 00:22:04,375
Don't know why you brought him here.

284
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:06,874
I told you to bring some decent-looking guys.

285
00:22:06,916 --> 00:22:09,625
They all look like criminals and idiots.

286
00:22:10,166 --> 00:22:13,541
You should be out of business.

287
00:22:18,708 --> 00:22:20,249
What is he staring at?

288
00:22:24,083 --> 00:22:27,583
He is smart and helpful

289
00:22:30,083 --> 00:22:31,916
I don't want the guy in blue either.

290
00:22:33,291 --> 00:22:35,166
You only need two men this time?

291
00:22:36,083 --> 00:22:38,958
Take the others to broaden their horizons.

292
00:22:44,666 --> 00:22:47,208
Got it!

293
00:22:47,416 --> 00:22:49,083
Let me see to it.

294
00:22:50,916 --> 00:22:53,958
What are you fucking looking at?

295
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,499
You, you, get lost!

296
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:59,833
Stop drinking and scram!

297
00:22:59,874 --> 00:23:02,124
You two come with me.

298
00:23:06,166 --> 00:23:07,958
Faster.

299
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,583
So slow!

300
00:23:12,375 --> 00:23:13,666
Big Bro Chiu,

301
00:23:13,708 --> 00:23:14,750
Wang Lei.

302
00:23:14,833 --> 00:23:16,083
Hong Qi.

303
00:23:16,124 --> 00:23:17,124
Say Big Bro Chiu.

304
00:23:17,166 --> 00:23:18,083
Big Bro Chiu!

305
00:23:19,541 --> 00:23:20,458
They understand Cantonese?

306
00:23:20,499 --> 00:23:23,375
Of course!

307
00:23:24,583 --> 00:23:27,499
Come have a drink.

308
00:23:27,833 --> 00:23:29,249
Spruce them up before sending them to Hong Kong.

309
00:23:29,291 --> 00:23:31,750
Sure will!

310
00:23:46,291 --> 00:23:47,541
Motherfucker.

311
00:23:47,583 --> 00:23:49,208
Sit and eat.

312
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,208
Commander,

313
00:23:54,249 --> 00:23:56,041
who's this Big Bro Chiu?

314
00:23:57,375 --> 00:24:00,333
Who cares if he is Big Bro Chiu or not?

315
00:24:04,124 --> 00:24:05,666
He is a douchebag.

316
00:24:05,708 --> 00:24:07,375
He is a sly,

317
00:24:07,416 --> 00:24:09,499
old fox who changes identities.

318
00:24:10,958 --> 00:24:14,625
He looks fucking like Kwai Ching-hung,

319
00:24:14,666 --> 00:24:16,458
the invisible King of Thieves in Hong Kong.

320
00:24:17,291 --> 00:24:20,083
Kwai Ching-hung disappeared

321
00:24:20,124 --> 00:24:21,708
after killing cops.

322
00:24:21,791 --> 00:24:24,541
Then Big Bro Chiu popped up.

323
00:24:24,583 --> 00:24:28,499
Big Bro Chiu is just a name.

324
00:24:50,083 --> 00:24:51,625
Is Fai here?

325
00:24:52,416 --> 00:24:53,958
Fai.

326
00:24:54,833 --> 00:24:55,541
What's up?

327
00:24:55,583 --> 00:24:57,249
- Someone is looking for you.    - Hey.

328
00:24:59,499 --> 00:25:00,791
Bro Coke?

329
00:25:01,499 --> 00:25:02,291
Hey!

330
00:25:02,333 --> 00:25:03,041
She's Thai?

331
00:25:03,083 --> 00:25:04,458
Noon, go buy a dozen Cokes.

332
00:25:04,541 --> 00:25:05,708
When did you come back?

333
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:06,958
Just now.

334
00:25:07,708 --> 00:25:10,249
You are too kind. Come in and have a seat.

335
00:25:10,291 --> 00:25:11,166
Did you just speak Thai?

336
00:25:11,291 --> 00:25:13,416
Do you think I speak French?

337
00:25:31,166 --> 00:25:32,333
You stink!

338
00:25:32,375 --> 00:25:33,874
Really?

339
00:25:34,083 --> 00:25:35,124
Bo.

340
00:25:35,166 --> 00:25:36,833
How can you be so rude?

341
00:25:36,916 --> 00:25:38,708
Come help set the table.

342
00:25:39,249 --> 00:25:40,791
Dinner will be served soon.

343
00:25:41,583 --> 00:25:42,874
Naughty girl.

344
00:25:43,166 --> 00:25:43,958
Go wash your hands.

345
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,499
I did wash my hands.

346
00:25:46,249 --> 00:25:49,499
You ate yesterday. Are you going to eat today?

347
00:25:51,083 --> 00:25:53,833
Bo, slow down. Don't rush.

348
00:25:53,874 --> 00:25:55,291
Bro Coke.

349
00:25:57,583 --> 00:25:58,541
You want some?

350
00:25:58,583 --> 00:26:00,375
Shall we share it?

351
00:26:02,083 --> 00:26:03,000
Don't let her drink it.

352
00:26:03,041 --> 00:26:05,416
She was coughing. I don't wanna spend money on meds.

353
00:26:05,458 --> 00:26:07,375
I wasn't coughing. I just had a fever.

354
00:26:07,416 --> 00:26:09,083
It's all right to have a sip.

355
00:26:09,166 --> 00:26:11,166
Not coughing? You are being cheeky!

356
00:26:11,208 --> 00:26:12,583
I say no Coke.

357
00:26:19,958 --> 00:26:22,958
Fai, I'm not gonna eat. I'm running late.

358
00:26:24,208 --> 00:26:25,166
You're going now?

359
00:26:25,291 --> 00:26:26,000
Yes.

360
00:26:29,874 --> 00:26:31,833
Be a good girl.

361
00:26:34,916 --> 00:26:36,499
Bro Coke, dig in.

362
00:26:37,333 --> 00:26:38,375
She's not eating with us?

363
00:26:38,416 --> 00:26:40,333
She has to work night shift.

364
00:26:43,416 --> 00:26:45,333
She's a legit masseuse.

365
00:26:46,541 --> 00:26:48,083
Eat some barbecued pork.

366
00:26:48,416 --> 00:26:50,041
Bo, eat some veggies.

367
00:26:50,083 --> 00:26:51,708
You seldom eat veggies.

368
00:26:54,041 --> 00:26:55,916
Shall we go to Ocean Park?

369
00:26:58,625 --> 00:27:00,375
Shall we ride the roller coaster?

370
00:27:04,666 --> 00:27:08,208
Shall we fly higher and farther?

371
00:27:08,249 --> 00:27:12,291
Tickle, tickle.

372
00:27:16,791 --> 00:27:18,708
Stop making noise, or the landlady will be nasty.

373
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:20,958
She's nasty because you haven't paid the rent.

374
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,458
You're being cheeky. Come down.

375
00:27:22,499 --> 00:27:25,166
What a dragon lady, arguing with your father!

376
00:27:25,583 --> 00:27:28,499
This girl plays too much! Wear your slippers.

377
00:27:28,541 --> 00:27:31,583
Have you finished your homework? Homework first.

378
00:27:31,625 --> 00:27:32,708
Quick!

379
00:27:34,166 --> 00:27:35,958
- I'll spank you.    - Good girl.

380
00:27:36,916 --> 00:27:38,791
This naughty girl!

381
00:27:41,291 --> 00:27:42,583
I've quit smoking.

382
00:27:42,958 --> 00:27:43,625
Quit?

383
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,625
I've quit smoking.

384
00:27:44,666 --> 00:27:46,000
"Whoring, gambling, drinking, roaming…

385
00:27:46,083 --> 00:27:47,708
and smoking are the hobbies of a king."

386
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:49,291
Your mantra.

387
00:27:52,208 --> 00:27:54,874
I'm on dialysis. I have to quit.

388
00:27:55,916 --> 00:27:57,124
Told you you're impotent.

389
00:27:57,166 --> 00:27:58,208
You feel dizzy when you squat.

390
00:27:58,249 --> 00:27:59,291
Fuck!

391
00:28:00,791 --> 00:28:02,375
What have you been up to?

392
00:28:02,708 --> 00:28:04,375
What can I do?

393
00:28:04,458 --> 00:28:06,458
I used to do temporary construction work.

394
00:28:06,499 --> 00:28:07,750
Now I'm a full-time babysitter.

395
00:28:07,791 --> 00:28:09,499
What about you?

396
00:28:09,541 --> 00:28:10,541
Me?

397
00:28:11,249 --> 00:28:13,375
I sell this in China.

398
00:28:14,708 --> 00:28:16,750
People won't use beepers anymore.

399
00:28:17,041 --> 00:28:18,833
Every Chinese will own a mobile phone in the future.

400
00:28:18,874 --> 00:28:21,583
One sells for RMB¥1K, 10 for RMB¥10K.

401
00:28:21,625 --> 00:28:22,874
I'll be fatter than Chow Yun-fat.

402
00:28:22,958 --> 00:28:24,625
Fat with loads of money?

403
00:28:25,124 --> 00:28:27,416
Great.

404
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:33,333
You're doing great. You're becoming a boss.

405
00:28:34,916 --> 00:28:39,791
Going straight is better than going astray.

406
00:28:39,833 --> 00:28:42,708
We're not fierce enough to be Kings of Thieves.

407
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:45,416
All we did were some petty crimes.

408
00:28:45,458 --> 00:28:49,625
Our life was insecure. We couldn't sleep well.

409
00:28:49,666 --> 00:28:53,124
And we didn't earn that much. So what's the point?

410
00:28:59,416 --> 00:29:01,208
I'd like to stay here for a few days.

411
00:29:01,249 --> 00:29:01,958
What?

412
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,458
I can sleep on the couch.

413
00:29:04,791 --> 00:29:05,625
What's that for?

414
00:29:05,666 --> 00:29:09,499
Take it. It will lessen your wife's burden.

415
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:14,375
Dad, I can't find my school manual!

416
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,416
Dad, Dad.

417
00:29:16,458 --> 00:29:17,750
Coming!

418
00:29:19,708 --> 00:29:20,833
That's fine

419
00:29:36,249 --> 00:29:38,750
(Gold shop)

420
00:29:49,291 --> 00:29:52,416
(Jockey Club)

421
00:29:52,499 --> 00:29:55,249
Panyu Yi Fa Market

422
00:29:57,333 --> 00:29:59,791
30 sets of 29-inch TVs. RMB¥12K apiece.

423
00:29:59,833 --> 00:30:02,416
Plus 80 VCD players. RMB¥4K a piece.

424
00:30:02,541 --> 00:30:04,208
RMB¥680K, thank you.

425
00:30:07,249 --> 00:30:09,124
You pay me RMB¥700K.

426
00:30:09,666 --> 00:30:10,874
I will notify you once the goods are delivered.

427
00:30:10,916 --> 00:30:12,041
Next.

428
00:30:12,124 --> 00:30:15,333
RMB¥30K for Chief Chen. Please count it.

429
00:30:17,833 --> 00:30:21,375
Business License

430
00:30:33,333 --> 00:30:36,291
RMB¥30K. The amount is correct.

431
00:30:37,375 --> 00:30:39,124
Will notify you once the goods are onboard.

432
00:30:41,249 --> 00:30:43,291
Please extend my thanks to Chief Chen.

433
00:30:44,333 --> 00:30:47,874
My VCD player is broken.

434
00:30:47,916 --> 00:30:49,958
I'll give you a new one. Kam.

435
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:50,916
Yes.

436
00:30:52,499 --> 00:30:55,791
The latest 33-inch TV set.

437
00:30:55,833 --> 00:30:57,208
Good stuff.

438
00:30:57,249 --> 00:30:58,583
I'll give it to you, too.

439
00:30:58,625 --> 00:31:00,083
Thanks so much, Boss Zhang.

440
00:31:00,124 --> 00:31:01,166
You're welcome.

441
00:31:02,874 --> 00:31:05,541
Gui, Guang, a 33-inch TV set and a VCD player.

442
00:31:05,583 --> 00:31:07,083
Gui, Guang, a 33-inch TV set and a VCD player.

443
00:31:07,124 --> 00:31:08,458
Sure.

444
00:31:09,625 --> 00:31:12,333
Da-bao Electronics

445
00:31:13,958 --> 00:31:15,791
She is greedy.

446
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:18,333
That's business.

447
00:31:18,583 --> 00:31:20,625
Don't pull a long face all day long.

448
00:31:20,708 --> 00:31:22,333
Boss Zhang, Boss Zhang.

449
00:31:22,375 --> 00:31:24,750
No worries. They will take care of it.

450
00:31:24,833 --> 00:31:26,333
- Quick    - What's wrong?

451
00:31:26,541 --> 00:31:28,249
Boss Zhang.

452
00:31:28,333 --> 00:31:29,708
What's wrong?

453
00:31:33,208 --> 00:31:34,166
Something wrong with the goods?

454
00:31:34,208 --> 00:31:36,166
No, close the door.

455
00:31:36,208 --> 00:31:37,833
Close the door.

456
00:31:43,083 --> 00:31:47,541
Want to play tough guy? Call your wife now.

457
00:31:57,874 --> 00:31:59,458
Call your wife now.

458
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:01,000
Tell your folks you're OK, asshole.

459
00:32:01,041 --> 00:32:03,124
If you kill me, you won't get a cent.

460
00:32:03,166 --> 00:32:04,791
Are you threatening me?

461
00:32:09,041 --> 00:32:10,874
Cheuk, be patient.

462
00:32:10,916 --> 00:32:13,333
If he doesn't talk, don't give him food or water.

463
00:32:20,458 --> 00:32:22,833
You're so noisy.

464
00:32:23,583 --> 00:32:25,458
Hey, what are you doing?

465
00:32:25,499 --> 00:32:27,541
Get him back! Get him back!

466
00:32:27,958 --> 00:32:30,083
This is the gold shop.

467
00:32:30,124 --> 00:32:32,166
Usually there's a police wagon at the entrance.

468
00:32:32,208 --> 00:32:34,083
Jockey Club is across the street.

469
00:32:34,124 --> 00:32:36,291
We keep a close eye on the police wagon.

470
00:32:36,333 --> 00:32:40,249
As soon as it leaves at 8 PM, we rob the gold shop right away.

471
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:43,249
It's the racing night. It will be crowded. After it's done…

472
00:32:43,291 --> 00:32:45,541
- There's not much money in this.    - Follow me closely.

473
00:32:47,041 --> 00:32:48,166
What did you just say?

474
00:32:50,333 --> 00:32:52,416
You've committed big crimes.

475
00:32:52,541 --> 00:32:55,166
Why pick this small gold shop?

476
00:32:55,208 --> 00:32:56,249
Yes,

477
00:32:56,291 --> 00:32:59,583
I've heard the 3 Kings of Thieves would join forces.

478
00:32:59,791 --> 00:33:02,291
At least millions of dollars will be involved.

479
00:33:03,083 --> 00:33:04,916
What 3 Kings of Thieves?

480
00:33:05,666 --> 00:33:07,041
Say it!

481
00:33:08,041 --> 00:33:11,625
Bro Foon, are you making a comeback?

482
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:14,249
This time with Cheuk Tze-keung and Kwai Ching-hung.

483
00:33:14,291 --> 00:33:18,874
The 3 Kings of Thieves are collaborating?

484
00:33:19,791 --> 00:33:22,166
Someone has seen you three meeting in China.

485
00:33:23,625 --> 00:33:25,249
Where did you hear this?

486
00:33:25,958 --> 00:33:27,541
Everyone is saying that.

487
00:33:27,791 --> 00:33:29,333
And you believe it?

488
00:33:29,375 --> 00:33:33,333
Didn't Big Bro say you couldn't make money by toting guns?

489
00:33:33,958 --> 00:33:35,000
If I'm Kwai,

490
00:33:35,041 --> 00:33:36,375
I don't have to eat lunch boxes with you.

491
00:33:38,166 --> 00:33:39,708
Idiots.

492
00:33:42,166 --> 00:33:43,708
That's ridiculous!

493
00:33:43,958 --> 00:33:45,583
Yip is all noise and fury.

494
00:33:45,625 --> 00:33:47,291
Kwai is hush and shush.

495
00:33:47,333 --> 00:33:49,541
We are so different. How can it work?

496
00:33:49,708 --> 00:33:51,750
Smuggle more goods with me.

497
00:33:51,791 --> 00:33:53,625
Let's make more money together!

498
00:33:54,708 --> 00:33:55,916
Got it.

499
00:33:56,041 --> 00:33:57,124
Brilliant!

500
00:33:57,166 --> 00:34:01,208
Sometimes I feel like toting my gun again.

501
00:34:01,249 --> 00:34:02,874
Robbery! Robbery!

502
00:34:02,916 --> 00:34:04,000
That's so cool!

503
00:34:04,041 --> 00:34:05,375
You call that cool?

504
00:34:05,874 --> 00:34:07,958
Big Bro wielding AK-47 is cool!

505
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:10,166
Not like this.

506
00:34:10,666 --> 00:34:12,166
AK-47 recoil is powerful.

507
00:34:12,208 --> 00:34:13,458
Don't hold it.

508
00:34:13,499 --> 00:34:14,583
Press it.

509
00:34:14,625 --> 00:34:15,583
Stand firm.

510
00:34:15,625 --> 00:34:17,333
Shoot the hell out of him.

511
00:34:27,083 --> 00:34:30,249
What the fuck?! Join me

512
00:34:31,333 --> 00:34:33,291
or go home and eat shit.

513
00:34:37,083 --> 00:34:39,666
Big Bro Chiu,

514
00:34:40,083 --> 00:34:43,708
how much can we earn from robbing this gold shop?

515
00:34:50,625 --> 00:34:51,416
You're calling or not?

516
00:34:51,458 --> 00:34:55,333
If the 3 Kings of Thieves join forces,

517
00:34:55,375 --> 00:34:57,166
even if we open a fish ball stall together,

518
00:34:57,208 --> 00:34:59,583
we will create a stir, right?

519
00:35:00,041 --> 00:35:02,000
What shall I call our stall?

520
00:35:02,041 --> 00:35:03,291
Are you calling your family or not?

521
00:35:21,375 --> 00:35:23,041
Hey, wake up!

522
00:35:25,416 --> 00:35:26,625
Gold depository?

523
00:35:27,166 --> 00:35:28,416
Racecourse?

524
00:35:33,249 --> 00:35:35,208
Kidnap Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten?

525
00:35:35,249 --> 00:35:37,124
The Head of Hong Kong and Macau Affairs, Lu Ping?

526
00:35:37,666 --> 00:35:38,874
No way.

527
00:36:01,291 --> 00:36:02,333
What are you listening?

528
00:36:02,416 --> 00:36:04,458
The 4 Heavenly Kings singing on stage together.

529
00:36:04,499 --> 00:36:05,791
What are they singing?

530
00:36:07,625 --> 00:36:09,833
I can't hear a thing. What's so good about it?

531
00:36:10,208 --> 00:36:12,166
When the 4 Heavenly Kings sing together,

532
00:36:12,208 --> 00:36:14,124
it's terrific no matter what they sing.

533
00:36:16,249 --> 00:36:18,958
Water, give me water.

534
00:36:19,249 --> 00:36:22,166
I will make the call.

535
00:36:34,458 --> 00:36:36,458
How's my husband? I beg you!

536
00:36:36,499 --> 00:36:38,833
He's not in good health. Don't hurt him.

537
00:36:38,874 --> 00:36:42,291
We are not as loaded as it may seem.

538
00:36:42,375 --> 00:36:44,625
Mr Cheuk, can you let my husband go?

539
00:36:44,666 --> 00:36:47,291
Name a price. I'll pay you from my own pocket…

540
00:36:55,041 --> 00:36:56,166
Hello?

541
00:36:56,208 --> 00:36:59,333
I have $80M in cash.

542
00:36:59,375 --> 00:37:00,666
Is it OK?

543
00:37:00,958 --> 00:37:02,375
$80M it is!

544
00:37:02,416 --> 00:37:04,375
Find Yip and Kwai!

545
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:08,499
What the hell?

546
00:37:08,541 --> 00:37:10,083
The 3 Kings of Thieves join forces for the first time.

547
00:37:10,124 --> 00:37:12,249
It will be terrific no matter what we do!

548
00:37:12,541 --> 00:37:13,583
You don't even have a plan yet,

549
00:37:13,666 --> 00:37:15,208
and you want 2 wanted men around you?

550
00:37:15,249 --> 00:37:15,958
You know I will

551
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,333
come up with a plan!

552
00:37:17,833 --> 00:37:20,000
This is the mountain I'm looking for.

553
00:37:20,041 --> 00:37:22,124
Himalaya!

554
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:52,249
Having night snack?

555
00:37:52,541 --> 00:37:53,458
There's Coke in the fridge.

556
00:37:53,499 --> 00:37:55,208
OK, I'll get it myself.

557
00:38:08,458 --> 00:38:12,000
Fai, how long is your friend staying?

558
00:38:14,499 --> 00:38:16,291
3 or 4 nights.

559
00:38:16,625 --> 00:38:18,041
We have a daughter.

560
00:38:18,083 --> 00:38:19,874
I don't feel comfortable…

561
00:38:19,958 --> 00:38:21,916
with a guy suddenly staying with us.

562
00:38:22,874 --> 00:38:26,208
What does he do?

563
00:38:27,791 --> 00:38:30,958
He sells mobile phones.

564
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,416
Don't worry.

565
00:38:32,916 --> 00:38:34,375
Go to sleep.

566
00:38:34,416 --> 00:38:34,916
OK.

567
00:38:34,958 --> 00:38:39,208
I'll go to bed after sewing.

568
00:38:45,375 --> 00:38:48,249
I will arrive with clients in 3 minutes.

569
00:38:48,416 --> 00:38:49,750
Got it.

570
00:38:53,375 --> 00:38:57,124
Gui, Guang, unload the goods. Be quick.

571
00:39:15,458 --> 00:39:16,625
Big Bro, we have a situation!

572
00:39:16,666 --> 00:39:18,499
Panyu Customs!

573
00:39:19,874 --> 00:39:21,833
Kam! Kam!

574
00:39:21,874 --> 00:39:23,375
Chung, pull over!

575
00:39:27,833 --> 00:39:29,625
Take a look over there.

576
00:39:29,708 --> 00:39:31,083
Take a look again over there.

577
00:39:32,791 --> 00:39:34,291
Don't move. Hands on your head.

578
00:39:34,916 --> 00:39:36,333
Let's go.

579
00:39:38,416 --> 00:39:39,750
Let's go.

580
00:39:40,583 --> 00:39:42,166
What about Kam?

581
00:39:42,208 --> 00:39:43,958
Find Mr Fong.

582
00:39:47,291 --> 00:39:50,708
Chinese customs

583
00:39:54,625 --> 00:39:56,083
Comrade.

584
00:39:56,124 --> 00:39:57,249
What do you want?

585
00:39:57,291 --> 00:39:58,833
We're looking for Chief Long.

586
00:39:58,874 --> 00:40:00,458
We're wondering

587
00:40:00,499 --> 00:40:04,708
if he can discharge the Lianhuashan goods and men?

588
00:40:09,833 --> 00:40:11,916
We know Mr Fong.

589
00:40:13,541 --> 00:40:15,541
In 4 days, the goods will be confiscated

590
00:40:15,583 --> 00:40:18,000
and the men will be executed.

591
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:20,291
Yes, we understand.

592
00:40:41,375 --> 00:40:43,291
Chief, someone wants to see you.

593
00:40:43,333 --> 00:40:46,041
OK.

594
00:40:49,708 --> 00:40:51,333
Chief Long is busy today.

595
00:40:51,375 --> 00:40:52,874
Come again tomorrow.

596
00:41:09,416 --> 00:41:11,666
All right. Yes…

597
00:41:16,333 --> 00:41:18,166
Chief Long is not seeing guests today.

598
00:41:18,208 --> 00:41:19,458
Come again tomorrow.

599
00:41:19,791 --> 00:41:20,583
Asshole.

600
00:41:20,625 --> 00:41:22,583
Who do you think you are?

601
00:41:23,625 --> 00:41:25,375
You don't want to save Kam anymore?

602
00:41:27,249 --> 00:41:28,916
Yes, yes.

603
00:41:34,874 --> 00:41:36,833
Chief Long said he wanted to talk over dinner.

604
00:41:36,874 --> 00:41:38,583
Find a restaurant and wait for him.

605
00:41:38,625 --> 00:41:39,708
Good.

606
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:41,791
Fengman Restaurant.

607
00:41:50,916 --> 00:41:51,583
Hello?

608
00:41:51,708 --> 00:41:53,791
I am in Fugui Restaurant with Chief Long.

609
00:41:54,083 --> 00:41:55,375
Coming right away.

610
00:41:55,416 --> 00:41:56,458
Let's go.

611
00:41:56,916 --> 00:41:58,666
Remember to bring a vase.

612
00:42:00,791 --> 00:42:01,625
Take the vase.

613
00:42:01,666 --> 00:42:03,000
Quick!

614
00:42:03,041 --> 00:42:04,208
Okay!

615
00:42:10,333 --> 00:42:11,375
Hurry up!

616
00:42:12,958 --> 00:42:14,041
Chief Long of Customs.

617
00:42:14,083 --> 00:42:15,583
He's my buddy.

618
00:42:15,708 --> 00:42:17,291
Chief Long, nice to meet you.

619
00:42:17,333 --> 00:42:21,124
I'm an official but you made me wait!

620
00:42:22,541 --> 00:42:23,458
Sorry,

621
00:42:23,499 --> 00:42:24,625
I went to Fengman Restaurant.

622
00:42:24,666 --> 00:42:26,499
Is the food there edible?

623
00:42:27,166 --> 00:42:29,333
He knows nothing about food!

624
00:42:29,375 --> 00:42:32,833
Chief Long is a foodie.

625
00:42:33,124 --> 00:42:34,708
Yes, you're right.

626
00:42:36,249 --> 00:42:38,958
Chief Long, he's my buddy.

627
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,458
Help him this time.

628
00:42:41,874 --> 00:42:43,458
Thank you.

629
00:42:43,499 --> 00:42:45,791
He's your buddy, not mine.

630
00:42:46,041 --> 00:42:50,000
I only help my friends!

631
00:42:50,083 --> 00:42:53,083
If we hit it off, we're friends.

632
00:42:53,499 --> 00:42:54,625
I'm hungry!

633
00:42:54,666 --> 00:42:55,375
Let's order first.

634
00:42:55,416 --> 00:42:57,750
Yes, let's order.

635
00:42:58,625 --> 00:43:00,124
What would you like?

636
00:43:00,166 --> 00:43:00,791
What would you like?

637
00:43:00,833 --> 00:43:01,916
Braised pork with preserved vegetables.

638
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,750
It's not refined enough for me.

639
00:43:05,375 --> 00:43:06,541
Let's order delicacies.

640
00:43:06,583 --> 00:43:08,124
Waiter!

641
00:43:15,416 --> 00:43:17,000
Thanks a lot.

642
00:43:19,375 --> 00:43:22,124
What's your name?

643
00:43:22,166 --> 00:43:23,625
Boss Zhang.

644
00:43:23,958 --> 00:43:25,791
Boss Zhang, right?

645
00:43:26,375 --> 00:43:29,791
You're a fun guy! A fun guy!

646
00:43:29,833 --> 00:43:31,833
Thank you.

647
00:43:32,375 --> 00:43:34,958
Chief Long, thanks for your help.

648
00:43:35,499 --> 00:43:39,791
Let's sing karaoke first.

649
00:43:39,833 --> 00:43:41,791
OK, karaoke first.

650
00:43:43,208 --> 00:43:44,416
Chung

651
00:43:44,791 --> 00:43:46,958
Give me name cards of karaoke bars and the phone.

652
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:47,958
Let's go for more fun.

653
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,208
I can't…

654
00:43:52,083 --> 00:43:53,916
Let's take a bath.

655
00:43:55,208 --> 00:43:56,583
It's good to take a bath.

656
00:43:56,625 --> 00:43:58,625
Find a sauna.

657
00:44:01,708 --> 00:44:04,124
Don't forget the vase.

658
00:44:04,166 --> 00:44:05,583
Yes.

659
00:44:14,791 --> 00:44:17,791
Chinese customs

660
00:44:17,833 --> 00:44:20,541
Thanks to connections, I didn't need to rot in jail.

661
00:44:20,874 --> 00:44:22,375
We stayed in a motel,

662
00:44:22,416 --> 00:44:24,916
with a bed, TV, OK food,

663
00:44:24,958 --> 00:44:26,541
though no whores!

664
00:44:26,708 --> 00:44:28,249
It's not bad, huh? What do you say?

665
00:44:28,291 --> 00:44:29,666
Yes, yes.

666
00:44:32,041 --> 00:44:34,958
Asshole, you didn't need to carouse with those officials!

667
00:44:35,375 --> 00:44:37,208
Don't complain about carousing,

668
00:44:37,249 --> 00:44:38,750
for money's sake.

669
00:44:42,124 --> 00:44:43,874
Hey! Come here.

670
00:44:43,916 --> 00:44:45,666
Our goods!

671
00:44:51,916 --> 00:44:53,249
Come.

672
00:44:53,916 --> 00:44:57,791
Your goods are here.

673
00:44:58,375 --> 00:44:59,583
Take a look. Any problems?

674
00:44:59,666 --> 00:45:02,124
Thanks so much.

675
00:45:02,166 --> 00:45:04,124
Let me take a look.

676
00:45:04,166 --> 00:45:08,541
Sign here if there's no problem.

677
00:45:08,583 --> 00:45:10,124
Thanks so much.

678
00:45:32,333 --> 00:45:33,791
OK.

679
00:47:36,958 --> 00:47:39,958
Your mole hasn't found Kwai's dossier

680
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,375
in the police station?

681
00:47:47,958 --> 00:47:51,416
No news about Yip in China?

682
00:47:54,708 --> 00:47:57,249
What about his underlings? His fences?

683
00:47:57,291 --> 00:48:00,833
His fellow illegal immigrants? His village mates?

684
00:48:01,208 --> 00:48:02,750
Can't find them?

685
00:48:03,958 --> 00:48:05,291
Nothing at all?

686
00:48:09,666 --> 00:48:10,874
Good.

687
00:48:12,249 --> 00:48:13,625
Good.

688
00:48:23,541 --> 00:48:24,916
Fuck you!

689
00:48:25,416 --> 00:48:27,333
Fuck you!

690
00:48:28,916 --> 00:48:31,375
The cops have offered a $1M reward on him.

691
00:48:31,416 --> 00:48:32,916
But there's no news over these years.

692
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,499
Give me some time.

693
00:48:35,541 --> 00:48:37,666
Reward money is a good idea.

694
00:48:39,166 --> 00:48:41,666
The cops offer $1M; I'll up it to $10M!

695
00:48:41,708 --> 00:48:43,583
If it's not enough, then $100M!

696
00:48:44,041 --> 00:48:45,833
I'll set up a special phone line.

697
00:48:45,874 --> 00:48:49,291
Whoever knows their whereabouts will get the money.

698
00:48:50,750 --> 00:48:53,416
So brazenly? The cops will tap the phone.

699
00:48:53,458 --> 00:48:55,458
Those assholes will prevent the 3 Kings from meeting up.

700
00:48:55,499 --> 00:48:57,166
Those assholes will prevent the 3 Kings from meeting up.

701
00:48:57,541 --> 00:48:59,083
Not necessarily.

702
00:48:59,708 --> 00:49:01,708
The cops want them too.

703
00:49:01,750 --> 00:49:03,958
They will send loads of people after us.

704
00:49:04,791 --> 00:49:07,041
Find a way to shake them off.

705
00:49:14,916 --> 00:49:15,375
Hello?

706
00:49:15,416 --> 00:49:15,791
Hello?

707
00:49:15,874 --> 00:49:16,791
Are you Cheuk?

708
00:49:16,833 --> 00:49:17,541
Yes.

709
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,166
Noon tomorrow. Bring a purple umbrella to Temple Street.

710
00:49:24,208 --> 00:49:25,499
I'll have you picked up.

711
00:49:26,291 --> 00:49:27,416
Get on.

712
00:49:31,166 --> 00:49:32,083
Take off your clothes.

713
00:49:32,124 --> 00:49:32,916
Take them all off.

714
00:49:59,458 --> 00:50:02,791
I worked with Kwai once. He's so average.

715
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:06,708
I know Yip. He lived in Guangdong.

716
00:50:06,750 --> 00:50:07,916
Kwai's real name is Xing Zhennan.

717
00:50:08,041 --> 00:50:09,499
His ancestral house was built by me.

718
00:50:09,666 --> 00:50:10,750
Yes.

719
00:50:11,750 --> 00:50:12,416
OK.

720
00:50:32,791 --> 00:50:35,666
I drove for Yip and was chased by the cops.

721
00:50:35,708 --> 00:50:37,166
I fenced for Yip.

722
00:50:37,208 --> 00:50:38,666
I was present in Yip's every heist.

723
00:50:38,708 --> 00:50:39,708
We wielded AK-47 together.

724
00:50:39,750 --> 00:50:42,375
Mr Cheuk, I envy you. I admire all your works.

725
00:50:42,416 --> 00:50:44,874
Yip bought sex from me.

726
00:50:44,916 --> 00:50:47,541
He was loud and proud.

727
00:50:49,874 --> 00:50:52,708
Heists? Hong Kong kids?

728
00:50:52,833 --> 00:50:55,958
These barking dogs are sneaky wussies.

729
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:00,666
I imported the Chinese retired soldiers to Hong Kong.

730
00:51:01,249 --> 00:51:04,041
What did I teach them before a heist?

731
00:51:04,083 --> 00:51:06,083
Moral principle!

732
00:51:06,124 --> 00:51:08,166
Father of the Chinese retired soldiers,

733
00:51:08,208 --> 00:51:09,583
can you cut to the chase?

734
00:51:09,666 --> 00:51:11,874
Do you know Yip or Kwai?

735
00:51:11,916 --> 00:51:14,791
Don't interrupt me when I talk.

736
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,333
If I talk too fast, you won't understand!

737
00:51:17,916 --> 00:51:19,375
Where was I?

738
00:51:19,791 --> 00:51:21,291
Moral principle.

739
00:51:21,333 --> 00:51:26,208
I once brought 3 Mainlanders

740
00:51:26,249 --> 00:51:30,208
to a showdown with the cops. Bang!

741
00:51:30,249 --> 00:51:33,041
One of them, Wei, was so scared he dropped his gun!

742
00:51:33,166 --> 00:51:36,041
You know what? I rushed to save him!

743
00:51:36,083 --> 00:51:39,666
He owes me a lot.

744
00:51:40,458 --> 00:51:42,458
Know who Kun-xi is?

745
00:51:45,416 --> 00:51:47,041
Yip's former boss?

746
00:51:48,583 --> 00:51:51,583
Quincy is Wei's godson.

747
00:51:51,625 --> 00:51:53,083
Want to meet him?

748
00:51:54,166 --> 00:51:55,416
$1M!

749
00:51:57,291 --> 00:51:58,499
You better check him out thoroughly.

750
00:51:58,541 --> 00:52:00,499
Check me out? Motherfucker.

751
00:52:00,916 --> 00:52:02,499
It's just $1M.

752
00:52:03,083 --> 00:52:04,458
Act fast.

753
00:52:05,166 --> 00:52:07,208
Quincy will stand in front of you tomorrow.

754
00:52:07,249 --> 00:52:08,541
Give me the dough.

755
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,000
Hey.

756
00:52:28,124 --> 00:52:29,750
Thanks so much!

757
00:52:30,750 --> 00:52:32,416
Let's go have some fun?

758
00:52:52,041 --> 00:52:55,166
Are you tight in cash lately, Taishan Boy?

759
00:52:55,249 --> 00:52:58,041
How can 3 pieces be enough?

760
00:53:07,666 --> 00:53:12,208
Guns are for firing, not for sniffing.

761
00:53:18,916 --> 00:53:22,333
Our commander taught us: safety first.

762
00:53:22,958 --> 00:53:24,416
Have you sniffed that Cheuk is looking for Yip and Kwai?

763
00:53:24,458 --> 00:53:28,333
Have you sniffed that Cheuk is looking for Yip and Kwai?

764
00:53:29,583 --> 00:53:34,000
Mr Cheuk says he wants to meet those two.

765
00:53:34,666 --> 00:53:37,208
Look, he has set up a special phone line.

766
00:53:37,249 --> 00:53:39,750
Info for money.

767
00:53:39,791 --> 00:53:41,583
How generous!

768
00:53:43,333 --> 00:53:45,291
Both of them are very dangerous.

769
00:53:45,874 --> 00:53:48,791
Which kingpin is not dangerous?

770
00:53:48,833 --> 00:53:50,874
They are being so brazen?

771
00:53:50,916 --> 00:53:52,541
The Handover is imminent.

772
00:53:52,583 --> 00:53:55,375
Because the Handover is imminent, you have to do big!

773
00:53:55,458 --> 00:53:59,541
After the Handover, it will be slim pickings, Idiot.

774
00:54:00,958 --> 00:54:02,291
Listen.

775
00:54:02,333 --> 00:54:03,666
Sniff out their whereabouts.

776
00:54:03,708 --> 00:54:07,416
The restoration of this Association depends on you!

777
00:54:08,249 --> 00:54:12,333
Keep me posted, kiddo.

778
00:54:12,375 --> 00:54:15,124
Keep me posted!

779
00:54:28,750 --> 00:54:29,666
Stand still, sir.

780
00:54:29,750 --> 00:54:30,791
What's wrong?

781
00:54:30,833 --> 00:54:31,416
Where are you going?

782
00:54:31,458 --> 00:54:32,708
Home.

783
00:54:32,750 --> 00:54:34,166
Your ID, please.

784
00:54:41,583 --> 00:54:42,458
Bo!

785
00:54:42,499 --> 00:54:45,166
Why didn't you come home right after school?

786
00:54:45,208 --> 00:54:47,416
I told you so many times.

787
00:54:47,708 --> 00:54:49,208
Where have you been?

788
00:54:49,249 --> 00:54:51,666
We've been looking for you everywhere.

789
00:54:52,916 --> 00:54:55,583
Bro Coke, you should've told us beforehand.

790
00:54:55,625 --> 00:54:57,750
- I thought I was on my way.    - You've scared the hell out of us.

791
00:55:08,958 --> 00:55:10,583
Shut up!

792
00:55:12,208 --> 00:55:14,041
Still drinking? Bad girl!

793
00:55:14,083 --> 00:55:15,499
What happened?

794
00:55:18,041 --> 00:55:19,625
She's naughty.

795
00:55:19,666 --> 00:55:21,750
Teach your girl at home, not on the street.

796
00:55:21,791 --> 00:55:23,166
- I'm sorry.    - You've frightened her.

797
00:55:23,208 --> 00:55:25,583
Yes, I'm sorry.

798
00:55:26,124 --> 00:55:27,625
Let's go home.

799
00:55:28,375 --> 00:55:29,583
Thank you, sir.

800
00:55:44,291 --> 00:55:45,666
Sorry.

801
00:55:55,083 --> 00:55:56,375
Darling.

802
00:55:57,041 --> 00:55:58,416
Daddy loves you.

803
00:55:58,458 --> 00:55:59,499
My good girl.

804
00:56:01,958 --> 00:56:03,083
3 Days!

805
00:56:03,291 --> 00:56:06,874
Chief Song helped us recover the goods in 3 days.

806
00:56:06,916 --> 00:56:09,541
Chief Song, my buddy!

807
00:56:09,583 --> 00:56:10,708
You rock!

808
00:56:11,124 --> 00:56:15,833
It's incumbent on the police to maintain order.

809
00:56:15,916 --> 00:56:17,583
It's incumbent on the police to maintain order.

810
00:56:17,625 --> 00:56:18,874
Boss Zhang,

811
00:56:19,083 --> 00:56:21,291
can you do me a favor?

812
00:56:27,833 --> 00:56:28,958
Go!

813
00:56:36,041 --> 00:56:37,958
Let him vent his anger.

814
00:56:38,750 --> 00:56:39,833
Stop!

815
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:59,249
Chief Song, you're a tea connoisseur.

816
00:57:04,083 --> 00:57:05,625
Enough.

817
00:57:07,625 --> 00:57:09,375
I need you to do me a favor.

818
00:57:09,416 --> 00:57:10,916
What do you mean?

819
00:57:11,833 --> 00:57:14,041
They are the sons of my ex-commander's friend.

820
00:57:14,083 --> 00:57:16,375
They are the sons of my ex-commander's friend.

821
00:57:16,791 --> 00:57:18,874
Forgive them.

822
00:57:19,916 --> 00:57:21,916
Give me face.

823
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,666
They robbed me.

824
00:57:29,124 --> 00:57:31,874
What have you lost?

825
00:57:33,208 --> 00:57:35,458
They robbed me! Me!

826
00:57:37,124 --> 00:57:39,208
We're good buddies.

827
00:57:39,249 --> 00:57:41,124
Who do you think you are?

828
00:57:41,166 --> 00:57:42,916
A petit bourgeois!

829
00:57:43,666 --> 00:57:48,083
A greedy, smuggling, tax-evading petit bourgeois!

830
00:57:48,916 --> 00:57:51,124
Don't think too highly of yourself.

831
00:57:51,166 --> 00:57:54,583
We're good buddies.

832
00:57:54,874 --> 00:57:56,416
Take them away!

833
00:57:57,416 --> 00:57:59,625
We're good buddies.

834
00:58:01,124 --> 00:58:02,541
Shoot him,

835
00:58:02,583 --> 00:58:04,874
I'll act according to the law!

836
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:21,750
Great, there's a vase in the toilet…

837
00:58:21,791 --> 00:58:22,791
We're lucky…

838
00:58:22,833 --> 00:58:24,499
It's small but it will do.

839
00:58:53,583 --> 00:58:55,750
We're good buddies.

840
00:59:21,541 --> 00:59:23,791
RMB¥2M, thank you!

841
00:59:23,833 --> 00:59:25,208
I receive RMB¥1.3M from you. Thanks.

842
00:59:25,249 --> 00:59:26,416
I'll notify you once we have the goods.

843
00:59:26,458 --> 00:59:27,625
Next.

844
00:59:27,666 --> 00:59:29,000
Take your time.

845
00:59:29,041 --> 00:59:30,416
It's insane!

846
00:59:30,583 --> 00:59:32,750
Everyone out.

847
00:59:32,791 --> 00:59:35,083
Get out!

848
00:59:35,291 --> 00:59:37,583
It's insane!

849
00:59:37,625 --> 00:59:38,499
What happened?

850
00:59:38,541 --> 00:59:40,958
Bro Foon, Cheuk has gone mad!

851
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:44,083
He set up a special phone line to look for you.

852
00:59:59,375 --> 01:00:00,874
Inspector Wu.

853
01:00:01,249 --> 01:00:03,458
You're difficult to tail.

854
01:00:03,499 --> 01:00:05,166
I had to wait here for you!

855
01:00:05,625 --> 01:00:06,916
I caught this guy for you.

856
01:00:06,958 --> 01:00:10,124
He said you gave him $1M for Kun-xi's whereabouts.

857
01:00:12,666 --> 01:00:13,916
Is it a crime to look for someone?

858
01:00:13,958 --> 01:00:16,041
No.

859
01:00:16,083 --> 01:00:17,874
But have you checked him out?

860
01:00:17,916 --> 01:00:20,166
He's been in jail for 20 years.

861
01:00:20,208 --> 01:00:22,916
The phone numbers back then only had 6 digits!

862
01:00:22,958 --> 01:00:24,083
He's out of touch now!

863
01:00:24,124 --> 01:00:24,958
Out of touch?

864
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,375
If I go to China, Wei will pick me up!

865
01:00:27,416 --> 01:00:28,291
Wei?

866
01:00:28,375 --> 01:00:30,124
He was shot dead two years ago!

867
01:00:30,166 --> 01:00:32,124
Kun-xi betrayed him!

868
01:00:32,833 --> 01:00:33,874
Have you been conned?

869
01:00:33,916 --> 01:00:35,666
I can arrest him now if you have.

870
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,625
An eye for an eye.

871
01:00:37,666 --> 01:00:38,541
That's moral principle.

872
01:00:38,583 --> 01:00:39,499
Calm down!

873
01:00:39,583 --> 01:00:41,333
I'm very calm.

874
01:00:41,958 --> 01:00:44,208
Or I'd have kicked you too!

875
01:00:47,750 --> 01:00:49,291
Want to report the crime?

876
01:00:49,666 --> 01:00:52,041
If not, I'll let him go.

877
01:00:52,833 --> 01:00:53,874
Well?

878
01:00:57,041 --> 01:01:00,041
If not, I'll let him go!

879
01:01:00,083 --> 01:01:01,000
Get lost!

880
01:01:01,041 --> 01:01:02,166
- Are you assaulting a police officer?    - Don't play tricks.

881
01:01:02,208 --> 01:01:04,333
So what? Motherfucker!

882
01:01:04,666 --> 01:01:05,916
Don't give up,

883
01:01:05,958 --> 01:01:07,375
keep searching for him.

884
01:01:07,416 --> 01:01:09,874
The Royal Hong Kong Police relies on your phone calls.

885
01:01:09,958 --> 01:01:12,124
The Royal Hong Kong Police relies on your phone calls.

886
01:01:21,124 --> 01:01:22,874
Why don't you just drop it?

887
01:01:23,416 --> 01:01:26,833
Don't ruin your impeccable record.

888
01:01:28,499 --> 01:01:30,416
I'd help you if I could!

889
01:01:31,499 --> 01:01:32,833
Even if you were to hit me,

890
01:01:32,874 --> 01:01:36,416
I must say it's a dead end!

891
01:01:41,375 --> 01:01:43,249
I know, I know!

892
01:01:43,583 --> 01:01:45,583
We've come to the climax of tonight.

893
01:01:45,625 --> 01:01:47,208
The last leg of the Triple Trio.

894
01:01:47,249 --> 01:01:51,249
The $170M jackpot pool.

895
01:01:51,291 --> 01:01:54,625
Plus the total bet amount. A single winner

896
01:01:54,750 --> 01:01:57,708
can collect over $300M.

897
01:01:57,750 --> 01:02:00,750
Many horse racing fans are placing bets.

898
01:02:00,791 --> 01:02:02,083
The whole city is abuzz!

899
01:02:02,124 --> 01:02:04,583
A single winning ticket will make you richer than any kings.

900
01:02:04,666 --> 01:02:06,124
See if you can win.

901
01:02:06,166 --> 01:02:10,874
Bets are placed on Wind Chaser.

902
01:02:11,249 --> 01:02:12,416
Gold Weather is the horse least expected to win.

903
01:02:12,458 --> 01:02:16,124
The odds are 99.

904
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:18,583
Win and Place.

905
01:02:22,124 --> 01:02:25,375
Motherfucker, almost $400M in the pool.

906
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,833
Hong Kong citizens are robbed by the Triple Trio.

907
01:02:30,249 --> 01:02:32,499
What does Triple Trio mean?

908
01:02:33,708 --> 01:02:37,166
The $170M jackpot pool

909
01:02:37,208 --> 01:02:39,291
has attracted many fans queuing to place their bets.

910
01:03:00,041 --> 01:03:00,750
No more clothes pegs?

911
01:03:00,791 --> 01:03:01,458
No.

912
01:03:01,499 --> 01:03:02,291
Go get some in the room.

913
01:03:02,333 --> 01:03:03,541
Sure.

914
01:04:00,166 --> 01:04:02,124
The race is about to start.

915
01:04:02,166 --> 01:04:05,124
The $170M jackpot pool.

916
01:04:05,166 --> 01:04:06,375
A single winner

917
01:04:06,416 --> 01:04:08,249
can collect over $300M!

918
01:04:08,375 --> 01:04:10,291
Who will be the lucky one?

919
01:04:10,375 --> 01:04:12,333
A dark horse will increase the size

920
01:04:12,375 --> 01:04:14,166
of the betting pool.

921
01:04:14,416 --> 01:04:16,958
The horses are in the stalls and ready to go.

922
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:18,750
Which horse will take off first?

923
01:04:18,791 --> 01:04:20,958
It's Wind Chaser.

924
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:22,750
It runs faster and faster.

925
01:04:22,791 --> 01:04:24,041
The rest can hardly catch up.

926
01:04:24,083 --> 01:04:27,333
Go! Go! Go!

927
01:04:30,541 --> 01:04:37,499
Faster! Faster! Faster!

928
01:04:40,833 --> 01:04:44,416
No one wins. The warehouse must be filled with money.

929
01:05:05,666 --> 01:05:06,916
Big Bro Chiu.

930
01:06:55,499 --> 01:06:56,124
Hey.

931
01:06:56,166 --> 01:06:59,874
Mr Cheuk, you know who Kun-xi is?

932
01:07:00,375 --> 01:07:02,625
It's Kun-xi speaking.

933
01:07:02,666 --> 01:07:06,874
Look me up in Guangdong. I won't let you down.

934
01:07:18,124 --> 01:07:21,458
You're really quitting? It's a cushy job.

935
01:07:21,499 --> 01:07:22,916
You're telling me!

936
01:07:24,166 --> 01:07:25,791
Talk to Big Bro yourself.

937
01:07:26,874 --> 01:07:32,124
I have invested all I got in the goods.

938
01:07:37,375 --> 01:07:40,833
You already know all those officials

939
01:07:40,916 --> 01:07:42,916
and connections well…

940
01:07:43,083 --> 01:07:44,499
What did you say?

941
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:47,333
Fisherman!

942
01:07:47,375 --> 01:07:48,750
Yes, Bro Foon.

943
01:07:51,041 --> 01:07:52,833
Give me Cheuk's number.

944
01:07:54,083 --> 01:07:55,291
Bro Foon.

945
01:07:55,333 --> 01:07:56,958
You got something to say?

946
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:58,333
No.

947
01:07:58,375 --> 01:07:59,833
Give me the number!

948
01:07:59,874 --> 01:08:01,208
Sure.

949
01:08:09,874 --> 01:08:14,000
Fuck! Thought I would be famous overnight.

950
01:08:14,416 --> 01:08:15,833
What a waste of time!

951
01:08:18,083 --> 01:08:19,916
Fame is not an issue.

952
01:08:19,958 --> 01:08:22,874
I can't just go back empty-handed.

953
01:08:22,916 --> 01:08:25,041
Not to mention having to chew this bread here.

954
01:08:33,249 --> 01:08:34,750
Big Bro Chiu,

955
01:08:34,791 --> 01:08:37,124
coming to Hong Kong has not been easy for us.

956
01:08:37,166 --> 01:08:40,333
We can't just go back like this.

957
01:08:48,166 --> 01:08:51,333
Big Bro Chiu, you really want us to leave?

958
01:08:55,124 --> 01:08:57,166
If you guys have something big in mind,

959
01:08:57,208 --> 01:08:59,000
count us in!

960
01:08:59,083 --> 01:09:01,083
We can do anything.

961
01:09:04,416 --> 01:09:06,041
I can keep a secret.

962
01:09:06,083 --> 01:09:08,499
If you say you're Big Bro Chiu, then so be it.

963
01:09:08,541 --> 01:09:10,916
I understand. Don't worry.

964
01:09:11,249 --> 01:09:14,958
I know the rules. It's between you and me.

965
01:09:15,416 --> 01:09:17,541
We have moral principle.

966
01:09:31,333 --> 01:09:32,583
Share it.

967
01:09:46,083 --> 01:09:47,750
Seriously, we can make it work.

968
01:09:47,791 --> 01:09:49,375
The 3 Kings of Thieves join forces…

969
01:10:26,083 --> 01:10:28,791
Mind your own business.

970
01:10:28,833 --> 01:10:30,499
Mind your own business.

971
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
Aren't you on dialysis? Still smoking?

972
01:11:04,416 --> 01:11:06,958
Old habits die hard.

973
01:11:10,916 --> 01:11:13,083
Are you still angry with me?

974
01:11:13,124 --> 01:11:15,833
You're planning to rob the gold shop downstairs?

975
01:11:21,541 --> 01:11:23,750
I thought you're paying me a visit.

976
01:11:24,333 --> 01:11:26,249
You're here just for the location.

977
01:11:27,666 --> 01:11:28,291
Listen to me…

978
01:11:28,333 --> 01:11:29,375
No more!

979
01:11:29,416 --> 01:11:29,833
Listen to me…

980
01:11:29,874 --> 01:11:31,291
I treat you as my brother. You treat me as a fool!

981
01:11:31,333 --> 01:11:31,916
I never treat you as a fool.

982
01:11:31,958 --> 01:11:34,124
Forget it! Just shut up!

983
01:11:35,958 --> 01:11:38,499
I have a wife and a daughter now.

984
01:11:39,041 --> 01:11:41,333
My life is great.

985
01:11:41,375 --> 01:11:43,916
Can you leave my family alone?

986
01:11:56,166 --> 01:11:57,958
I'm in the wrong this time.

987
01:12:03,083 --> 01:12:05,583
You know it's hard to make a living.

988
01:12:14,666 --> 01:12:16,416
We're sworn brothers.

989
01:12:17,958 --> 01:12:19,791
I owe you this time.

990
01:12:23,041 --> 01:12:25,958
Forget what happened these past few days.

991
01:12:27,041 --> 01:12:28,750
Keep it to yourself.

992
01:12:50,916 --> 01:12:52,541
I'll leave early tomorrow morning.

993
01:12:52,833 --> 01:12:54,791
You won't see me again.

994
01:13:14,666 --> 01:13:15,916
Uncle Coke.

995
01:13:18,874 --> 01:13:20,291
Not in bed yet?

996
01:13:33,583 --> 01:13:36,249
Guangdong province

997
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:48,083
Sai Wan Container Terminal, Hong Kong

998
01:14:54,375 --> 01:14:55,458
Mr Cheuk,

999
01:14:55,499 --> 01:14:57,291
I've heard so much about you.

1000
01:15:01,249 --> 01:15:02,499
Where's Yip?

1001
01:15:02,958 --> 01:15:05,916
Let me show you something.

1002
01:15:05,958 --> 01:15:07,249
This way.

1003
01:15:09,958 --> 01:15:12,874
Mr Cheuk. How's your journey?

1004
01:15:12,916 --> 01:15:15,083
I'll treat you to something special.

1005
01:15:15,124 --> 01:15:17,874
Shrimps and crabs are local specialties.

1006
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:21,249
After food we'll find two shampoo girls for you.

1007
01:15:21,291 --> 01:15:23,333
This way, please.

1008
01:15:25,124 --> 01:15:28,708
Type 54 pistols, grenades, AK weapons.

1009
01:15:28,750 --> 01:15:30,458
I've got all you want.

1010
01:15:30,708 --> 01:15:32,124
Where's Yip?

1011
01:15:34,041 --> 01:15:37,499
The truck outside holds a ton of dynamite.

1012
01:15:38,208 --> 01:15:39,666
Bang!

1013
01:15:39,750 --> 01:15:41,249
You can blow up whatever you want.

1014
01:15:42,291 --> 01:15:44,208
Where's Yip?

1015
01:15:49,583 --> 01:15:51,375
They were all retired soldiers.

1016
01:15:51,416 --> 01:15:52,916
They're fearless veterans in battles!

1017
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:54,708
I want Yip!

1018
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:01,249
Coin!

1019
01:16:08,333 --> 01:16:09,458
Give it to me!

1020
01:16:14,041 --> 01:16:16,666
Big Bro, let's think it through.

1021
01:16:16,708 --> 01:16:18,208
Give it to me!

1022
01:16:18,791 --> 01:16:19,666
We're doing all right.

1023
01:16:19,708 --> 01:16:21,750
Why go back to our old business?

1024
01:16:22,708 --> 01:16:23,791
Are you lecturing me?

1025
01:16:23,833 --> 01:16:25,666
We're making money!

1026
01:16:25,750 --> 01:16:27,458
We can't be robbers for the rest of our lives!

1027
01:16:27,499 --> 01:16:29,333
You do it!

1028
01:16:29,375 --> 01:16:31,124
You have struck a deal with the Fisherman!

1029
01:16:32,291 --> 01:16:34,583
Big Bro, he was just thinking out loud.

1030
01:16:34,625 --> 01:16:35,874
Leave if you want!

1031
01:16:35,958 --> 01:16:37,249
I won't stop you!

1032
01:16:37,291 --> 01:16:39,208
Do you know what time it is? You don't sleep?

1033
01:16:39,249 --> 01:16:41,124
Go fuck yourself!

1034
01:16:42,666 --> 01:16:44,000
Fuck you!

1035
01:16:44,124 --> 01:16:45,041
Come down!

1036
01:17:00,333 --> 01:17:02,499
Yip has retired!

1037
01:17:02,541 --> 01:17:04,208
He used to be my man!

1038
01:17:04,249 --> 01:17:05,291
Am I not a better partner?

1039
01:17:05,333 --> 01:17:07,625
Who the hell are you?

1040
01:17:12,499 --> 01:17:13,208
Hello?

1041
01:17:13,249 --> 01:17:15,041
Hello, Cheuk.

1042
01:17:15,083 --> 01:17:16,958
It's Yip Kwok-foon speaking.

1043
01:17:20,291 --> 01:17:21,375
Are you kidding me?

1044
01:17:22,208 --> 01:17:23,833
Why should I believe you?

1045
01:17:23,874 --> 01:17:25,958
I am who I am!

1046
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:27,708
If you don't believe me, let's meet up!

1047
01:17:29,041 --> 01:17:30,458
Wait. Got another call.

1048
01:17:30,499 --> 01:17:31,083
Fuck you!

1049
01:17:31,166 --> 01:17:32,583
Wait for what? Hello?

1050
01:17:33,124 --> 01:17:33,791
Hello?

1051
01:17:34,124 --> 01:17:34,916
Hey!

1052
01:17:35,416 --> 01:17:36,000
Hey!

1053
01:17:40,166 --> 01:17:41,249
You are dead!

1054
01:17:41,666 --> 01:17:42,916
Go up!

1055
01:17:43,083 --> 01:17:44,166
Go up!

1056
01:17:46,375 --> 01:17:47,333
Hello?

1057
01:17:47,958 --> 01:17:49,166
Speak!

1058
01:17:49,708 --> 01:17:51,375
Are you Cheuk?

1059
01:17:52,208 --> 01:17:53,166
Who's speaking?

1060
01:17:59,208 --> 01:18:00,666
Kwai Ching-hung.

1061
01:18:03,124 --> 01:18:04,708
Need my help?

1062
01:18:06,124 --> 01:18:07,708
Are you kidding me?

1063
01:18:09,458 --> 01:18:11,499
Do you have any proof?

1064
01:18:12,416 --> 01:18:15,249
I robbed Tung Shing Watch in 1986.

1065
01:18:16,041 --> 01:18:17,499
I killed 3 plainclothes

1066
01:18:17,541 --> 01:18:19,208
in 1988.

1067
01:18:19,499 --> 01:18:20,791
And Landmark in 1992…

1068
01:18:22,041 --> 01:18:25,625
Wasn't it Yip who robbed Landmark in 1992!

1069
01:18:28,041 --> 01:18:30,124
Don't be so gullible.

1070
01:18:30,750 --> 01:18:34,124
Jumbo Watch in 1994 and Lucky Guy Jewellery two years ago.

1071
01:18:34,249 --> 01:18:35,958
I did them all.

1072
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
Do you think only Yip had AK-47?

1073
01:18:38,041 --> 01:18:40,708
He loved to be on camera and the cops were dumb.

1074
01:18:40,750 --> 01:18:43,958
- I just took advantage of the situation…    - Hold on! Don't hang up.

1075
01:18:56,499 --> 01:18:57,791
What did you just say?

1076
01:18:57,833 --> 01:18:58,625
Fuck you!

1077
01:18:58,666 --> 01:18:59,375
Are you playing me?

1078
01:19:01,583 --> 01:19:04,416
It's you, Yip!

1079
01:19:06,625 --> 01:19:09,750
Landmark in 1992, Jumbo in 1994, and Lucky Guy two years ago.

1080
01:19:09,791 --> 01:19:10,583
Are you responsible for all?

1081
01:19:10,625 --> 01:19:11,625
No!

1082
01:19:11,666 --> 01:19:12,666
I never did my jobs in clandestine!

1083
01:19:12,833 --> 01:19:15,458
Why should I hide myself?

1084
01:19:50,750 --> 01:19:51,708
We're all here.

1085
01:19:51,958 --> 01:19:52,874
Where are you right now?

1086
01:19:52,916 --> 01:19:54,291
Hong Kong!

1087
01:19:55,583 --> 01:19:57,458
I'll call you when I'm back in Hong Kong.

1088
01:20:20,958 --> 01:20:21,958
Hello?

1089
01:20:25,208 --> 01:20:26,208
Hello?

1090
01:20:31,541 --> 01:20:32,625
Hello?

1091
01:20:32,708 --> 01:20:34,791
Kwai Ching-hung, you still there?

1092
01:20:35,458 --> 01:20:36,000
Hello?

1093
01:20:36,083 --> 01:20:36,708
Yes.

1094
01:20:37,583 --> 01:20:39,083
Where are you?

1095
01:20:41,874 --> 01:20:42,791
Hong Kong.

1096
01:20:47,625 --> 01:20:49,499
Call you when I'm back in Hong Kong.

1097
01:20:49,583 --> 01:20:50,791
Let's talk later.

1098
01:21:01,499 --> 01:21:03,000
Motherfucker! The 3 Kings

1099
01:21:03,041 --> 01:21:04,375
of Thieves have nothing to do with you.

1100
01:21:05,041 --> 01:21:06,708
Since you're here,

1101
01:21:07,750 --> 01:21:09,791
you can't bail without leaving something.

1102
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:16,166
Yes.

1103
01:21:37,874 --> 01:21:39,916
There's less than $10M here.

1104
01:21:40,666 --> 01:21:42,541
Mr Cheuk's life

1105
01:21:44,333 --> 01:21:46,750
worth at least $100M!

1106
01:21:58,708 --> 01:21:59,708
Put your guns down!

1107
01:22:02,416 --> 01:22:04,791
Retired soldiers? Go!

1108
01:22:10,083 --> 01:22:11,208
Car key.

1109
01:22:11,916 --> 01:22:13,208
Car key!

1110
01:22:27,750 --> 01:22:29,750
You think I'm bullshitting?

1111
01:22:31,666 --> 01:22:33,583
If you don't treat me as your Big Bro, let's split!

1112
01:22:34,416 --> 01:22:36,499
Big Bro, we always follow your orders.

1113
01:22:36,541 --> 01:22:37,874
You said "drop the guns," we dropped the guns.

1114
01:22:37,916 --> 01:22:38,625
You said "drop the guns," we dropped the guns.

1115
01:22:38,666 --> 01:22:39,583
Is that very hard for you?

1116
01:22:39,625 --> 01:22:40,499
No, we always follow you, Big Bro.

1117
01:22:40,541 --> 01:22:41,833
No, we always follow you, Big Bro.

1118
01:22:41,916 --> 01:22:43,666
We support you no matter what!

1119
01:22:47,583 --> 01:22:49,083
Are you looking down on me?

1120
01:22:49,416 --> 01:22:51,291
I stoop so low that I need your support?

1121
01:22:51,791 --> 01:22:53,041
I don't need you!

1122
01:22:53,083 --> 01:22:54,916
You're just my followers!

1123
01:22:57,333 --> 01:22:58,874
Hey you!

1124
01:23:00,375 --> 01:23:01,625
What are you fighting for?

1125
01:23:01,666 --> 01:23:04,791
Sorry, we're tourists.

1126
01:23:04,833 --> 01:23:08,583
We got lost, so we quarreled.

1127
01:23:08,625 --> 01:23:10,583
The residents upstairs filed a complaint.

1128
01:23:11,541 --> 01:23:13,124
- Where are your IDs?    - Here.

1129
01:23:21,333 --> 01:23:24,333
We planned to take a boat to Macau

1130
01:23:25,124 --> 01:23:26,499
but got lost here.

1131
01:23:26,541 --> 01:23:28,083
We couldn't find the pier.

1132
01:23:28,166 --> 01:23:31,166
So we quarreled.

1133
01:23:33,750 --> 01:23:34,916
Call the station.

1134
01:23:35,708 --> 01:23:38,375
PC1844 calling the station. Send.

1135
01:23:43,666 --> 01:23:45,708
Quick!

1136
01:23:45,750 --> 01:23:47,499
Don't let him flee!

1137
01:23:47,541 --> 01:23:48,916
Motherfucker!

1138
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:51,916
He's in the front!

1139
01:23:52,458 --> 01:23:53,666
Go after him!

1140
01:24:20,333 --> 01:24:22,291
Hello? Uncle Dog, I've found them.

1141
01:24:22,583 --> 01:24:24,791
Believe it or not, they called me up!

1142
01:24:24,958 --> 01:24:26,458
I even got a whole ton of dynamite!

1143
01:24:26,499 --> 01:24:28,625
It will work this time. Get me a boat.

1144
01:24:28,666 --> 01:24:30,791
I have an idea!

1145
01:24:30,833 --> 01:24:32,166
We'll blow up the Handover ceremony!

1146
01:24:32,208 --> 01:24:34,166
We can threaten either the British queen or the Chinese government.

1147
01:24:34,208 --> 01:24:36,083
It will create a stir for sure!

1148
01:24:36,208 --> 01:24:37,458
What the fuck!

1149
01:25:25,583 --> 01:25:26,874
The night snack is here. Back yet?

1150
01:25:26,916 --> 01:25:27,750
Coming back.

1151
01:25:27,833 --> 01:25:30,124
We're at the entrance to the complainant's building.

1152
01:25:30,499 --> 01:25:33,333
It's quiet. No one's here. OVER.

1153
01:25:34,750 --> 01:25:38,000
Be civilized. Don't talk too loud.

1154
01:25:38,041 --> 01:25:40,541
If you go to Macau, take the ferry in Sheung Wan.

1155
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:42,208
This is Sai Wan.

1156
01:25:42,249 --> 01:25:43,041
Oh.

1157
01:25:43,541 --> 01:25:46,208
Go to the main street and take a cab.

1158
01:25:46,499 --> 01:25:47,291
Take a cab!

1159
01:25:52,041 --> 01:25:54,666
Mainlanders are numskulls.

1160
01:28:34,333 --> 01:28:35,458
Quick!

1161
01:28:43,458 --> 01:28:45,041
Mainlanders?

1162
01:28:45,666 --> 01:28:47,499
I'm Yip Kwok-foon!

1163
01:29:59,750 --> 01:30:02,499
Military Police

1164
01:31:24,249 --> 01:31:25,083
Waiter.

1165
01:31:26,166 --> 01:31:28,000
Sir, have you reserved a table?

1166
01:31:28,041 --> 01:31:29,458
I booked a room under the name of Chen.

1167
01:31:29,583 --> 01:31:31,708
Give me a second.

1168
01:31:33,041 --> 01:31:36,208
Mr Chen. Please follow me.

1169
01:31:36,625 --> 01:31:37,874
This way, please.

1170
01:31:37,916 --> 01:31:38,916
Hey.

1171
01:31:38,958 --> 01:31:39,708
Where is our rice?

1172
01:31:39,750 --> 01:31:40,874
Rice? Give me a second.

1173
01:31:41,083 --> 01:31:42,916
Your rice is coming right away.

1174
01:31:45,416 --> 01:31:47,249
Sorry to keep you waiting.

1175
01:31:47,333 --> 01:31:48,499
Thank you.

1176
01:31:48,541 --> 01:31:50,000
Enjoy your food.

1177
01:31:50,499 --> 01:31:52,208
Mr Chen. This way, please.

1178
01:31:52,833 --> 01:31:55,291
Hey! Haven't you gone to the bathroom just now?

1179
01:31:55,375 --> 01:31:59,166
Wait! Don't puke!

1180
01:31:59,708 --> 01:32:01,874
Are you all right?

1181
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:05,041
I thought you went to the restroom. Why are you here?

1182
01:32:05,583 --> 01:32:06,874
I'm sorry. This way, please.

1183
01:32:06,916 --> 01:32:08,208
We are super busy today.

1184
01:32:08,249 --> 01:32:09,375
- Hey!    - This way, please.

1185
01:32:09,458 --> 01:32:10,958
The rice is cold!

1186
01:32:11,249 --> 01:32:12,249
Give me a second.

1187
01:32:12,291 --> 01:32:13,916
- I'm sorry. The rice is cold?    - I want tea.

1188
01:32:13,958 --> 01:32:15,124
Give me a second. I'll give you another bowl.

1189
01:32:15,166 --> 01:32:16,583
- Quick!    - Tell me the room number. I'll look for it myself.

1190
01:32:16,625 --> 01:32:18,833
- I want tea.    - Give me a second.

1191
01:32:18,874 --> 01:32:19,666
Sure I'll get you tea.

1192
01:32:19,708 --> 01:32:22,499
Give me a second. I'll be right back.

1193
01:32:27,541 --> 01:32:29,750
We should not forget you.

1194
01:32:29,791 --> 01:32:33,208
And we should watch with the closest interests

1195
01:32:33,291 --> 01:32:39,083
as you embark on this new era of your remarkable history.
