1
00:02:00,625 --> 00:02:02,333
Police.

2
00:02:02,333 --> 00:02:04,250
Show me your ID.

3
00:02:10,292 --> 00:02:12,208
- Check his ID.
- Yes sir.

4
00:02:12,917 --> 00:02:14,708
- What's in your bag?
- Headquarter,

5
00:02:14,708 --> 00:02:19,042
- Let me see.
- please verify ID number 0532743…

6
00:02:19,042 --> 00:02:20,625
Bracket 1, Kwai Ching-hung.

7
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:23,458
Open it.

8
00:02:33,083 --> 00:02:35,375
The arrangement for Hong Kong

9
00:02:35,375 --> 00:02:40,375
contained in the agreement
are not measures of expediency.

10
00:02:40,375 --> 00:02:44,583
They are long-term policies
which will be incorporated

11
00:02:44,583 --> 00:02:47,000
in the Basic Law for Hong Kong

12
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,917
and preserved intact for 50 years from 1997.

13
00:02:52,792 --> 00:02:55,292
It is the common interests

14
00:02:55,292 --> 00:02:59,792
as well as shared
responsibilities of China and Britain

15
00:02:59,792 --> 00:03:07,208
to ensure the Joint Declaration is fully
implemented with no encumbrances.

16
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:30,875
An armed robbery took place this afternoon in Kwun Tong.

17
00:03:30,875 --> 00:03:34,958
<i>4 armed suspects robbed 5 gem shops
on Mut Watt Street.</i>

18
00:03:34,958 --> 00:03:36,167
Fuck you!

19
00:03:36,167 --> 00:03:39,167
In the footage provided by our audience,

20
00:03:39,167 --> 00:03:42,542
the robbers exchanged fire

21
00:03:42,542 --> 00:03:44,625
with the Special Duties Unit.

22
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:48,292
2 passersby and 3 policemen
were injured in the incident.

23
00:03:48,292 --> 00:03:51,292
The<i>5</i>gold shops lost $1 OM in total.

24
00:03:51,292 --> 00:03:53,583
The police believe the mastermind

25
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:55,500
is the “Most Wanted” Yip Kwok-foon.

26
00:03:58,167 --> 00:04:02,333
Bro foon, you're unbeatable!

27
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:04,958
But shit has hit the fan!

28
00:04:05,667 --> 00:04:07,625
I told you to put more newspaper underneath!

29
00:04:07,625 --> 00:04:09,750
Look, there's blood everywhere!

30
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,917
Take it, jerk!

31
00:04:15,208 --> 00:04:17,083
Shit has really hit the fan!

32
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:20,458
I can give you 20% tops. Sorry.

33
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:22,000
We agreed on 40%.

34
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,625
Don't you have moral principle?

35
00:04:23,625 --> 00:04:26,000
You're paying $2M for $10M's worth of swag?

36
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,500
We used to get 50%!

37
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:29,500
Now you fences are getting it all!

38
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,292
We're getting shit!

39
00:04:31,292 --> 00:04:33,333
Time has changed.

40
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:35,875
The cops are on the prowl!

41
00:04:42,417 --> 00:04:45,333
Especially for your swag, Bro foon!

42
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:49,000
It took us 2 years to fence it last time!

43
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:52,417
Stocks, real estate,
and even chestnuts are more profitable!

44
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:56,917
Do me a favor.

45
00:04:56,917 --> 00:04:58,167
40%.

46
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:04,625
Bro foon, you always have your way!

47
00:05:09,583 --> 00:05:11,792
How about you find another fence?

48
00:05:11,792 --> 00:05:14,375
If I can't take it, I doubt others would dare to!

49
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:15,958
Fuck you!

50
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:19,875
Open the safe!

51
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:21,500
Are you robbing me?

52
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:33,333
Don't make me do it.

53
00:05:58,667 --> 00:06:00,708
Thanks so much, Bro foon.

54
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:04,792
Don't look me up in the future.

55
00:06:04,792 --> 00:06:06,792
There's no more business between us!

56
00:06:09,542 --> 00:06:11,417
We go separate ways!

57
00:06:45,667 --> 00:06:47,875
Light, Bro foon.

58
00:07:17,042 --> 00:07:18,375
Fisherman!

59
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:29,500
Don't worry.

60
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,458
These ships belong to Yi Fa.

61
00:07:31,958 --> 00:07:32,792
What's Yi Fa?

62
00:07:32,792 --> 00:07:34,125
Yi Fa from Panyu, Guangzhou.

63
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:35,625
They smuggle electric appliances.

64
00:07:36,667 --> 00:07:39,500
So pompously? So brazenly?

65
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:43,292
They have strong backing. It's legit!

66
00:07:43,875 --> 00:07:49,667
A TV set sells for $2K
in Hong Kong and $8K in China.

67
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:55,292
They earn millions of dollars in each transaction.

68
00:07:55,292 --> 00:07:57,375
Cash keeps rolling in!

69
00:08:10,208 --> 00:08:12,250
Used notes with no consecutive serial numbers.

70
00:08:12,542 --> 00:08:13,792
I need them today!

71
00:08:13,792 --> 00:08:15,500
You have $80M over there.

72
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:19,208
I want it by 5pm!

73
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:22,000
You go get it. I want it now!

74
00:08:23,042 --> 00:08:25,458
Manager Shum, how much do we have?

75
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:27,583
Manager Fok!

76
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:45,833
We are in love but can't be together.

77
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:54,833
I wait day by day but you never come back…

78
00:08:54,833 --> 00:09:04,167
I want to forget you but you haunt my memory.

79
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:07,958
Mr Cheuk,

80
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:10,542
let's discuss the price.

81
00:09:15,542 --> 00:09:17,667
Was it a bit flat?

82
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:20,458
No way! Let's start over!

83
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:24,167
Red face,

84
00:09:24,625 --> 00:09:27,458
red skirt, red scarf,

85
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:30,750
like white paper…

86
00:09:40,792 --> 00:09:43,500
I said let's start over. Didn't you hear me?

87
00:09:46,667 --> 00:09:49,542
I said let's start over. Didn't you hear me?

88
00:09:49,542 --> 00:09:51,458
Let's not waste time!

89
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,417
Mr Tycoon,

90
00:10:10,875 --> 00:10:13,667
we agreed on $3 billion.

91
00:10:13,667 --> 00:10:15,292
That's final.

92
00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:18,583
It's impossible to get so much cash
out of the blue.

93
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:21,542
I've only got $500M on hand.

94
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:30,083
Did I say you could go?

95
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:33,000
Take the $5OOM now.

96
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,542
Don't get too greedy.

97
00:10:34,542 --> 00:10:36,250
Then I'll give you back half of your son.

98
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:38,833
You want the upper or lower half?

99
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:41,292
Do you really think I won't call the police?

100
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:45,167
Do the cops know where your son is?

101
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:53,208
All they can do is arrest and torture me.

102
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:55,458
But after 48 hours, they have to release me.

103
00:10:55,458 --> 00:10:58,042
By that time, however, you son will be…

104
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:03,792
Call the Commissioner of Police!

105
00:11:06,792 --> 00:11:09,375
I said let's start over. Didn't you hear me?

106
00:11:11,542 --> 00:11:14,875
You hear me, or not?

107
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:17,083
If you can't hear me with your ear,

108
00:11:17,083 --> 00:11:19,875
I might as well cut if off, OK?

109
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:23,208
Please don't!

110
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:25,542
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

111
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:32,542
You should've said so earlier.

112
00:11:45,667 --> 00:11:47,125
What's up?

113
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:48,958
The Commissioner didn't answer?

114
00:11:59,042 --> 00:12:01,375
You're playing me, right?

115
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:02,958
Let's play it all the way then!

116
00:12:19,417 --> 00:12:21,458
Leaving so soon, Officer Wu?

117
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:23,625
Mr Tycoon is looking for you.

118
00:12:23,625 --> 00:12:26,958
Mr Tycoon, didn't you call the cops? Come here!

119
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:31,333
Mr Ho.

120
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:33,583
They are sending these dogs after me,

121
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:35,167
but they are useless.

122
00:12:35,417 --> 00:12:38,542
No wonder it was easy to kidnap your son.

123
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,167
So, you are willing to confess?

124
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:42,792
Officer,

125
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:46,458
if I said I'd fucked your mother,
did I really fuck her?

126
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:49,542
Shouldn't you ask Mr Ho where his son is?

127
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,125
My son…

128
00:12:52,417 --> 00:12:53,792
is all right.

129
00:12:54,458 --> 00:12:57,000
I came here to borrow money from Mr Tycoon.

130
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,250
Is that a crime?

131
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:01,708
Mr Ho, tell us if he's threatening you.

132
00:13:01,708 --> 00:13:03,000
We can arrest him right away!

133
00:13:03,417 --> 00:13:04,167
No, he's not.

134
00:13:04,167 --> 00:13:06,250
Have you heard it loud and clear, Officer?

135
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:08,708
I said he's not threatening me!

136
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:13,292
Calm down, Royal Hong Kong Police!

137
00:13:14,667 --> 00:13:15,667
Mr Tycoon,

138
00:13:15,667 --> 00:13:17,583
how much will you “lend” me?

139
00:13:18,042 --> 00:13:19,333
$3 billion.

140
00:13:39,083 --> 00:13:41,083


141
00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:42,958
Are you in Guangzhou for business or leisure?

142
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:47,333
Excuse me?

143
00:13:49,458 --> 00:13:51,583
Business? Travel?

144
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:55,125
Yea, I am a businessman.

145
00:14:01,417 --> 00:14:05,042
Guangzhou Railway Station

146
00:14:25,792 --> 00:14:27,708
I'd like to reserve a private room

147
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:31,917
at 8pm tomorrow.

148
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,083
My name is Chen. Thank you.

149
00:15:00,792 --> 00:15:02,375
Hello, Commander.

150
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:04,417
8pm tomorrow at Fengman Restaurant.

151
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,750
Who the fuck am I? I'm Chiu.

152
00:15:09,042 --> 00:15:10,625
Don't make me fucking wait for you.

153
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:11,833
That's it.

154
00:15:57,917 --> 00:16:01,500
Fengman Restaurant

155
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:04,583
Almost there, Mr Fong.

156
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:05,583
OK.

157
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,875
Which room?

158
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:10,042
OK. Coming.

159
00:16:10,042 --> 00:16:11,458
- Take it.
- What?

160
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:13,667
Take it. Let me put the tie on.

161
00:16:15,417 --> 00:16:16,625
Da-bao. This way.

162
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:17,458
Mr Fong.

163
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:18,500
Where's the vase?

164
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:19,875
It's just a cheap one.

165
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:21,250
Never mind. Let's go.

166
00:16:23,167 --> 00:16:24,500
Chief Chen.

167
00:16:28,917 --> 00:16:30,458
Chief Chen.

168
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,792
This is Zhang Da-bao, Boss Zhang,

169
00:16:37,792 --> 00:16:38,917
who has bought Yi Fa.

170
00:16:38,917 --> 00:16:41,625
This is Chief Chen from Industry and Commerce.

171
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:43,167
We're buddies.

172
00:16:43,417 --> 00:16:44,333
Nice to meet you, Chief Chen.

173
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:45,625
Nice to meet you.

174
00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:46,500
Let's have a drink.

175
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,417
Let's drink together.

176
00:16:47,417 --> 00:16:49,333
Have a seat.

177
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:52,458
Bottoms up!

178
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:58,208
Boss Zhang cannot drink?

179
00:16:58,208 --> 00:16:59,292
Bottoms up!

180
00:16:59,292 --> 00:17:01,000
I said bottoms up!

181
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:01,875
Yes!

182
00:17:01,875 --> 00:17:03,500
Bottoms up!

183
00:17:08,208 --> 00:17:09,875
Da-bao is my buddy.

184
00:17:10,292 --> 00:17:12,625
We've only met quite recently.

185
00:17:12,625 --> 00:17:15,375
But we hit it off right away!

186
00:17:15,375 --> 00:17:16,750
Chief Chen,

187
00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:19,125
Chief Chen,

188
00:17:19,667 --> 00:17:21,125
please help him.

189
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:25,208
This vase must be expensive!

190
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:27,417
Just a modest gift.

191
00:17:27,667 --> 00:17:29,000
Here's how it works:

192
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,583
when Chief Chen grows tired of it,
Boss Zhang can buy it back!

193
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:35,333
It's worth at least RMB¥300K!

194
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:39,208
Didn't we agree on RMB¥200K?

195
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:41,708
I got the price wrong?

196
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:44,458
Oh, even Homer sometimes nods.

197
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:45,667
No way!

198
00:17:45,667 --> 00:17:48,917
Chief Chen is a connoisseur.

199
00:17:48,917 --> 00:17:50,708
What do we know?

200
00:17:50,708 --> 00:17:53,125
If Chief Chen says RMB¥300K, then it's RMB¥300K.

201
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:56,167
Come get the business license tomorrow.

202
00:17:56,167 --> 00:17:59,500
I'll have it nicely framed for you.

203
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,750
Thanks so much, Chief Chen.

204
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:02,500
We're buddies.

205
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:05,250
Boss Zhang, what would you like to eat?

206
00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:08,292
Braised pork with preserved vegetables.

207
00:18:09,292 --> 00:18:11,500
That's too oily for me.

208
00:18:13,833 --> 00:18:15,042
Let me order.

209
00:18:15,292 --> 00:18:18,042
Shall we have a seafood platter?

210
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:19,875
Let me order it.

211
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:21,167
Waiter!

212
00:18:21,167 --> 00:18:23,167
Mr Zhang, best of luck with your business!

213
00:18:23,167 --> 00:18:24,708
Thanks a lot.

214
00:18:25,292 --> 00:18:26,167
Cheers.

215
00:18:26,167 --> 00:18:26,833
Bottoms up!

216
00:18:27,208 --> 00:18:28,542
Bottoms up!

217
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:42,208
This guy plays golf every Sunday
in Clear Water Bay.

218
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:47,500
One-way road. Quiet. No phone signal. It may work.

219
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,292
Hey! Where's our rice?

220
00:18:49,292 --> 00:18:50,500
Next.

221
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:53,125
This one is easy.

222
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:55,250
A super playboy.

223
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:57,667
Drunk every night.

224
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:01,708
He recently has an actress as a mistress.

225
00:19:04,708 --> 00:19:05,625
Hey!

226
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:06,542
Where is our rice?

227
00:19:06,542 --> 00:19:07,917
Rice? Give me a second.

228
00:19:07,917 --> 00:19:09,625
Your rice is coming right away.

229
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:13,000
Sometimes he would send his driver away.

230
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,125
Sorry to keep you waiting.

231
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:16,333
Enjoy your food.

232
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:18,000
Close the door.

233
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:23,542
Sir, please follow me.

234
00:19:23,792 --> 00:19:25,042
Give me a cup of tea.

235
00:19:25,042 --> 00:19:26,542
Hey! Haven't you gone to the bathroom just now?

236
00:19:26,542 --> 00:19:28,375
- Wait! Don't puke.
- Hey! The rice is cold!

237
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:29,458
Give me a second.

238
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:30,958
- I'm sorry. The rice is cold?
- I want tea.

239
00:19:30,958 --> 00:19:32,458
- Hurry up!
- Tell me the room number…

240
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:34,625
- I want tea.
- Give me a second. I'll show you the way.

241
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:35,542
Sure, I'll get you tea.

242
00:19:35,542 --> 00:19:38,042
Give me a second. I will be right back.

243
00:19:40,667 --> 00:19:42,625
Take it easy.

244
00:19:42,625 --> 00:19:45,333
We came to China to shake off those cop dogs.

245
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:46,458
You went too far last time!

246
00:19:46,458 --> 00:19:48,750
I live life to the full.

247
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:51,958
C'est la vie.

248
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:53,583
There's no other way.

249
00:19:57,250 --> 00:20:01,875
We've stolen cars, committed burglaries,

250
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:03,250
and robbed cash vans.

251
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:07,125
We even kidnapped the tycoon's son.

252
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:08,625
Should we do more kidnaps?

253
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:12,333
What do you have in mind?

254
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:15,292
Spit it out. We can discuss.

255
00:20:38,875 --> 00:20:41,208
I'm a mountaineer.

256
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:43,583
After conquering one mountain,

257
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:47,208
I need to find a higher and harder mountain.

258
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:49,708
That's it.

259
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:54,000
Before finding that mountain,

260
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,875
let's find the money first.

261
00:20:57,583 --> 00:20:58,792
Let's keep doing it.

262
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,375
Cheng, 53 years old.

263
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:05,792
No children. His wife is in charge.

264
00:21:06,542 --> 00:21:10,125
A mobile phone used to cost over RMB¥10K.
Who could afford that?

265
00:21:10,125 --> 00:21:12,792
Not everyone is a child of
a high-ranking official.

266
00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:16,500
Now the cheaper, the better.

267
00:21:17,833 --> 00:21:20,250
We have a population of 10 million.

268
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:22,708
Say RMB¥1K a set,

269
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:27,208
RMB¥10K for 10 sets.

270
00:21:27,208 --> 00:21:30,833
We will be fatter than Chow Yun-fat!

271
00:21:31,917 --> 00:21:35,708
Beepers are already outdated.

272
00:21:36,958 --> 00:21:41,542
OK, I'll talk to you later.

273
00:21:44,667 --> 00:21:47,125
Excuse me, Boss.

274
00:21:50,917 --> 00:21:52,333
Please go on.

275
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:56,750
Don't give us a hard time.
We're doing small business.

276
00:21:56,750 --> 00:22:01,833
Big Bro, these kids are great.

277
00:22:02,583 --> 00:22:04,542
The guy who came in first
has criminal record in Hong Kong.

278
00:22:04,542 --> 00:22:06,208
Don't know why you brought him here.

279
00:22:06,917 --> 00:22:08,750
I told you to bring some decent-looking guys.

280
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:11,458
They all look like criminals and idiots.

281
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,375
You should be out of business.

282
00:22:20,542 --> 00:22:22,083
What is he staring at?

283
00:22:25,917 --> 00:22:29,417
He is smart and helpful

284
00:22:31,917 --> 00:22:33,750
I don't want the guy in blue either.

285
00:22:35,125 --> 00:22:37,000
You only need two men this time?

286
00:22:37,917 --> 00:22:40,792
Take the others to broaden their horizons.

287
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:49,250
Got it!

288
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:50,917
Let me see to it.

289
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:55,833
What are you fucking looking at?

290
00:22:55,833 --> 00:22:58,375
You, you, get lost!

291
00:22:58,375 --> 00:23:01,708
Stop drinking and scram!

292
00:23:01,708 --> 00:23:03,958
You two come with me.

293
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,833
Faster.

294
00:23:09,833 --> 00:23:11,417
So slow!

295
00:23:14,208 --> 00:23:15,542
Big Bro Chiu,

296
00:23:15,542 --> 00:23:16,667
Wang Lei.

297
00:23:16,667 --> 00:23:17,958
Hong Qi.

298
00:23:17,958 --> 00:23:19,000
Say Big Bro Chiu.

299
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:19,917
Big Bro Chiu!

300
00:23:21,375 --> 00:23:22,333
They understand Cantonese?

301
00:23:22,333 --> 00:23:25,208
Of course!

302
00:23:26,417 --> 00:23:29,333
Come have a drink.

303
00:23:29,667 --> 00:23:31,125
Spruce them up before sending them to Hong Kong.

304
00:23:31,125 --> 00:23:33,583
Sure will!

305
00:23:48,125 --> 00:23:49,417
Motherfucker.

306
00:23:49,417 --> 00:23:51,042
Sit and eat.

307
00:23:54,833 --> 00:23:56,083
Commander,

308
00:23:56,083 --> 00:23:57,875
who's this Big Bro Chiu?

309
00:23:59,208 --> 00:24:02,167
Who cares if he is Big Bro Chiu or not?

310
00:24:05,958 --> 00:24:07,500
He is a douchebag.

311
00:24:07,542 --> 00:24:09,250
He is a sly,

312
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:11,333
old fox who changes identities.

313
00:24:12,792 --> 00:24:16,500
He looks fucking like Kwai Ching-hung,

314
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,292
the invisible King of Thieves in Hong Kong.

315
00:24:19,125 --> 00:24:21,958
Kwai Ching-hung disappeared

316
00:24:21,958 --> 00:24:23,542
after killing cops.

317
00:24:23,625 --> 00:24:26,417
Then Big Bro Chiu popped up.

318
00:24:26,417 --> 00:24:30,333
Big Bro Chiu is just a name.

319
00:24:51,917 --> 00:24:53,458
Is Fai here?

320
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:55,792
Fai.

321
00:24:56,667 --> 00:24:57,417
What's up?

322
00:24:57,417 --> 00:24:59,083
- Someone is looking for you.
- Hey.

323
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:02,625
Bro Coke?

324
00:25:03,333 --> 00:25:04,167
Hey!

325
00:25:04,167 --> 00:25:04,917
She's Thai?

326
00:25:04,917 --> 00:25:06,375
Noon, go buy a dozen of Cokes.

327
00:25:06,375 --> 00:25:07,583
When did you come back?

328
00:25:07,583 --> 00:25:08,792
Just now.

329
00:25:09,542 --> 00:25:12,125
You are too kind. Come in and have a seat.

330
00:25:12,125 --> 00:25:13,125
Did you just speak Thai?

331
00:25:13,125 --> 00:25:15,250
Do you think I speak French?

332
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,208
You stink!

333
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:35,708
Really?

334
00:25:35,917 --> 00:25:37,000
Bo.

335
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,750
How can you be so rude?

336
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:40,542
Come help set the table.

337
00:25:41,083 --> 00:25:42,625
Dinner will be served soon.

338
00:25:43,417 --> 00:25:44,708
Naughty girl.

339
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:45,833
Go wash your hands.

340
00:25:45,833 --> 00:25:47,333
I did wash my hands.

341
00:25:48,083 --> 00:25:51,333
You ate yesterday. Are you going to eat today?

342
00:25:52,917 --> 00:25:55,708
Bo, slow down. Don't rush.

343
00:25:55,708 --> 00:25:57,125
Bro Coke.

344
00:25:59,417 --> 00:26:00,417
You want some?

345
00:26:00,417 --> 00:26:02,208
Shall we share it?

346
00:26:03,917 --> 00:26:04,875
Don't let her drink it.

347
00:26:04,875 --> 00:26:07,292
She was coughing.
I don't wanna spend money on meds.

348
00:26:07,292 --> 00:26:09,250
I wasn't coughing. I just had a fever.

349
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:11,000
It's all right to have a sip.

350
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,042
Not coughing? You are being cheeky!

351
00:26:13,042 --> 00:26:14,417
I say no Coke.

352
00:26:21,792 --> 00:26:24,792
Fai, I'm not gonna eat. I'm running late.

353
00:26:26,042 --> 00:26:27,125
You're going now?

354
00:26:27,125 --> 00:26:27,875
Yes.

355
00:26:31,708 --> 00:26:33,667
Be a good girl.

356
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:38,333
Bro Coke, dig in.

357
00:26:39,167 --> 00:26:40,250
She's not eating with us?

358
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:42,167
She has to work night shift.

359
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:47,167
She's a legit masseuse.

360
00:26:48,375 --> 00:26:49,917
Eat some barbecued pork.

361
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:51,917
Bo, eat some veggies.

362
00:26:51,917 --> 00:26:53,542
You seldom eat veggies.

363
00:26:55,875 --> 00:26:57,750
Shall we go to Ocean Park?

364
00:27:00,458 --> 00:27:02,208
Shall we ride the roller coaster?

365
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:10,083
Shall we fly higher and farther?

366
00:27:10,083 --> 00:27:14,125
Tickle, tickle.

367
00:27:18,625 --> 00:27:20,583
Stop making noise, or the landlady will be nasty.

368
00:27:20,583 --> 00:27:22,833
She's nasty because you haven't paid the rent.

369
00:27:22,833 --> 00:27:24,333
You're being cheeky. Come down.

370
00:27:24,333 --> 00:27:27,000
What a dragon lady, arguing with your father!

371
00:27:27,417 --> 00:27:30,375
This girl plays too much! Wear your slippers.

372
00:27:30,375 --> 00:27:33,458
Have you finished your homework? Homework first.

373
00:27:33,458 --> 00:27:34,542
Quick!

374
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,792
- I'll spank you.
- Good girl.

375
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:40,625
This naughty girl!

376
00:27:43,125 --> 00:27:44,417
I've quit smoking.

377
00:27:44,792 --> 00:27:45,500
Quit?

378
00:27:45,833 --> 00:27:46,500
I've quit smoking.

379
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:47,917
"Whoring, gambling, drinking, roaming…

380
00:27:47,917 --> 00:27:49,583
and smoking are the hobbies of a king."

381
00:27:49,583 --> 00:27:51,125
Your mantra.

382
00:27:54,042 --> 00:27:56,708
I'm on dialysis. I have to quit.

383
00:27:57,750 --> 00:27:59,000
Told you you're impotent.

384
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,083
You feel dizzy when you squat.

385
00:28:00,083 --> 00:28:01,125
Fuck!

386
00:28:02,625 --> 00:28:04,208
What have you been up to?

387
00:28:04,542 --> 00:28:06,292
What can I do?

388
00:28:06,292 --> 00:28:08,333
I used to do temporary construction work.

389
00:28:08,333 --> 00:28:09,625
Now I'm a full-time babysitter.

390
00:28:09,625 --> 00:28:11,375
What about you?

391
00:28:11,375 --> 00:28:12,375
Me?

392
00:28:13,083 --> 00:28:15,208
I sell this in China.

393
00:28:16,542 --> 00:28:18,583
People won't use beepers anymore.

394
00:28:18,875 --> 00:28:20,708
Every Chinese will own
a mobile phone in the future.

395
00:28:20,708 --> 00:28:23,458
One sells for RMB¥1K, 10 for RMB¥10K.

396
00:28:23,458 --> 00:28:24,792
I'll be fatter than Chow Yun-fat.

397
00:28:24,792 --> 00:28:26,458
Fat with loads of money?

398
00:28:26,958 --> 00:28:29,250
Great.

399
00:28:32,167 --> 00:28:35,167
You're doing great. You're becoming a boss.

400
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:41,667
Going straight is better than going astray.

401
00:28:41,667 --> 00:28:44,583
We're not fierce enough to be Kings of Thieves.

402
00:28:44,583 --> 00:28:47,292
All we did were some petty crimes.

403
00:28:47,292 --> 00:28:51,500
Our life was insecure. We couldn't sleep well.

404
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:54,958
And we didn't earn that much.
So what's the point?

405
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:03,083
I'd like to stay here for a few days.

406
00:29:03,083 --> 00:29:03,833
What?

407
00:29:03,833 --> 00:29:05,292
I can sleep on the couch.

408
00:29:06,625 --> 00:29:07,500
What's that for?

409
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:11,333
Take it. It will lessen your wife's burden.

410
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:16,208
Dad, I can't find my school manual!

411
00:29:16,833 --> 00:29:18,292
Dad, Dad.

412
00:29:18,292 --> 00:29:19,583
Coming!

413
00:29:21,542 --> 00:29:22,667
That's fine

414
00:29:38,083 --> 00:29:40,625
(Gold shop)

415
00:29:51,125 --> 00:29:54,333
(Jockey Club)

416
00:29:54,333 --> 00:29:57,083
Panyu Yi Fa Market

417
00:29:59,167 --> 00:30:01,667
30 sets of 29-inch TVs. RMB¥12K apiece.

418
00:30:01,667 --> 00:30:04,375
Plus 80 VCD players. RMB¥4K a piece.

419
00:30:04,375 --> 00:30:06,042
RMB¥680K, thank you.

420
00:30:09,083 --> 00:30:10,958
You pay me RMB¥700K.

421
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:12,750
I will notify you once the goods are delivered.

422
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:13,958
Next.

423
00:30:13,958 --> 00:30:17,167
RMB¥30K for Chief Chen. Please count it.

424
00:30:19,667 --> 00:30:23,208
Business License

425
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:38,125
RMB¥30K. The amount is correct.

426
00:30:39,208 --> 00:30:40,958
Will notify you once the goods are onboard.

427
00:30:43,083 --> 00:30:45,125
Please extend my thanks to Chief Chen.

428
00:30:46,167 --> 00:30:49,750
My VCD player is broken.

429
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:51,833
I'll give you a new one. Kam.

430
00:30:51,833 --> 00:30:52,750
Yes.

431
00:30:54,333 --> 00:30:57,667
The latest 33-inch TV set.

432
00:30:57,667 --> 00:30:59,083
Good stuff.

433
00:30:59,083 --> 00:31:00,458
I'll give it to you, too.

434
00:31:00,458 --> 00:31:01,958
Thanks so much, Boss Zhang.

435
00:31:01,958 --> 00:31:03,000
You're welcome.

436
00:31:04,708 --> 00:31:08,958
Gui, Guang, a 33-inch TV set and a VCD player.

437
00:31:08,958 --> 00:31:10,292
Sure.

438
00:31:11,458 --> 00:31:14,167
Da-bao Electronics

439
00:31:15,792 --> 00:31:17,625
She is greedy.

440
00:31:18,375 --> 00:31:20,167
That's business.

441
00:31:20,417 --> 00:31:22,542
Don't pull a long face all daylong.

442
00:31:22,542 --> 00:31:24,208
Boss Zhang, Boss Zhang.

443
00:31:24,208 --> 00:31:26,583
No worries. They will take care of it.

444
00:31:26,667 --> 00:31:28,167
- Quick
- What's wrong?

445
00:31:28,375 --> 00:31:30,167
Boss Zhang.

446
00:31:30,167 --> 00:31:31,542
What's wrong?

447
00:31:35,042 --> 00:31:36,042
Something wrong with the goods?

448
00:31:36,042 --> 00:31:38,042
No, close the door.

449
00:31:38,042 --> 00:31:39,667
Close the door.

450
00:31:44,917 --> 00:31:49,375
Want to play tough guy? Call your wife now.

451
00:31:59,708 --> 00:32:01,292
Call your wife now.

452
00:32:01,583 --> 00:32:02,875
Tell your folks you're OK, asshole.

453
00:32:02,875 --> 00:32:05,000
If you kill me, you won't get a cent.

454
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,625
Are you threatening me?

455
00:32:10,875 --> 00:32:12,750
Cheuk, be patient.

456
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:15,167
If he doesn't talk, don't give him food or water.

457
00:32:22,292 --> 00:32:24,667
You're so noisy.

458
00:32:25,417 --> 00:32:27,333
Hey, what are you doing?

459
00:32:27,333 --> 00:32:29,375
Get him back! Get him back!

460
00:32:29,792 --> 00:32:31,958
This is the gold shop.

461
00:32:31,958 --> 00:32:34,042
Usually there's a police wagon at the entrance.

462
00:32:34,042 --> 00:32:35,958
Jockey Club is across the street.

463
00:32:35,958 --> 00:32:38,167
We keep a close eye on the police wagon.

464
00:32:38,167 --> 00:32:42,083
As soon as it leaves at 8pm,
we rob the gold shop right away.

465
00:32:42,583 --> 00:32:45,125
It's the racing night. It will be crowded.
After it's done…

466
00:32:45,125 --> 00:32:47,375
- There's not much money in this.
- Follow me closely.

467
00:32:48,875 --> 00:32:50,000
What did you just say?

468
00:32:52,167 --> 00:32:54,375
You've committed big crimes.

469
00:32:54,375 --> 00:32:57,042
Why pick this small gold shop?

470
00:32:57,042 --> 00:32:58,125
Yes,

471
00:32:58,125 --> 00:33:01,417
I've heard the 3 Kings
of Thieves would join forces.

472
00:33:01,625 --> 00:33:04,125
At least millions of dollars will be involved.

473
00:33:04,917 --> 00:33:06,750
What 3 Kings of Thieves?

474
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:08,875
Say it!

475
00:33:09,875 --> 00:33:13,583
Bro foon, are you making a comeback?

476
00:33:13,583 --> 00:33:16,125
This time with Cheuk Tze-keung
and Kwai Ching-hung.

477
00:33:16,125 --> 00:33:20,708
The 3 Kings of Thieves are collaborating?

478
00:33:21,625 --> 00:33:24,000
Someone has seen you three meeting in China.

479
00:33:25,458 --> 00:33:27,083
Where did you hear this?

480
00:33:27,792 --> 00:33:29,375
Everyone is saying that.

481
00:33:29,625 --> 00:33:31,208
And you believe it?

482
00:33:31,208 --> 00:33:35,167
Didn't Big Bro say you couldn't
make money by toting guns?

483
00:33:35,792 --> 00:33:36,875
If I'm Kwai,

484
00:33:36,875 --> 00:33:38,208
I don't have
to eat lunch boxes with you.

485
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,542
Idiots.

486
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,542
That's ridiculous!

487
00:33:45,792 --> 00:33:47,458
Yip is all noise and fury.

488
00:33:47,458 --> 00:33:49,167
Kwai is hush and shush.

489
00:33:49,167 --> 00:33:51,375
We are so different. How can it work?

490
00:33:51,542 --> 00:33:53,625
Smuggle more goods with me.

491
00:33:53,625 --> 00:33:55,458
Let's make more money together!

492
00:33:56,542 --> 00:33:57,875
Got it.

493
00:33:57,875 --> 00:33:59,000
Brilliant!

494
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:03,083
Sometimes I feel like toting my gun again.

495
00:34:03,083 --> 00:34:04,750
Robbery! Robbery!

496
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:05,875
That's so cool!

497
00:34:05,875 --> 00:34:07,208
You call that cool?

498
00:34:07,708 --> 00:34:09,792
Big Bro wielding AK-47 is cool!

499
00:34:10,583 --> 00:34:12,000
Not like this.

500
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:14,042
AK-47 recoil is powerful.

501
00:34:14,042 --> 00:34:15,333
Don't hold it.

502
00:34:15,333 --> 00:34:16,458
Press it.

503
00:34:16,458 --> 00:34:17,458
Stand firm.

504
00:34:17,458 --> 00:34:19,167
Shoot the hell out of him.

505
00:34:28,917 --> 00:34:32,083
What the fuck?! Join me

506
00:34:33,167 --> 00:34:35,125
or go home and eat shit.

507
00:34:38,917 --> 00:34:41,500
Big Bro Chiu,

508
00:34:41,917 --> 00:34:45,542
how much can we earn from robbing this gold shop?

509
00:34:52,458 --> 00:34:53,292
You're calling or not?

510
00:34:53,292 --> 00:34:57,208
If the 3 Kings of Thieves join forces,

511
00:34:57,208 --> 00:34:59,042
even if we open a fish ball stall together,

512
00:34:59,042 --> 00:35:01,417
we will create a stir, right?

513
00:35:01,875 --> 00:35:03,875
What shall I call our stall?

514
00:35:03,875 --> 00:35:05,125
Are you calling your family or not?

515
00:35:23,208 --> 00:35:24,875
Hey, wake up!

516
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:28,458
Gold depository?

517
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,250
Racecourse?

518
00:35:35,083 --> 00:35:37,083
Kidnap Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten?

519
00:35:37,083 --> 00:35:38,958
The Head of Hong Kong and Macau Affairs, Lu Ping?

520
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:40,708
No way.

521
00:36:03,125 --> 00:36:04,250
What are you listening?

522
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:06,333
The 4 Heavenly Kings singing on stage together.

523
00:36:06,333 --> 00:36:07,625
What are they singing?

524
00:36:09,458 --> 00:36:11,667
I can't hear a thing. What's so good about it?

525
00:36:12,042 --> 00:36:14,042
When the 4 Heavenly Kings sing together,

526
00:36:14,042 --> 00:36:15,958
it's terrific no matter what they sing.

527
00:36:18,083 --> 00:36:20,792
Water, give me water.

528
00:36:21,083 --> 00:36:24,000
I will make the call.

529
00:36:36,292 --> 00:36:38,333
How's my husband? I beg you!

530
00:36:38,333 --> 00:36:40,708
He's not in good health. Don't hurt him.

531
00:36:40,708 --> 00:36:44,208
We are not as loaded as it may seem.

532
00:36:44,208 --> 00:36:46,500
Mr Cheuk, can you let my husband go?

533
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:49,125
Name a price. I'll pay you from my own pocket…

534
00:36:56,875 --> 00:36:58,042
Hello?

535
00:36:58,042 --> 00:37:01,208
I have $80M in cash.

536
00:37:01,208 --> 00:37:02,500
Is it OK?

537
00:37:02,792 --> 00:37:04,250
$80M it is!

538
00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:06,208
Find Yip and Kwai!

539
00:37:09,583 --> 00:37:10,375
What the hell?

540
00:37:10,375 --> 00:37:11,958
The 3 Kings of Thieves
join forces for the first time.

541
00:37:11,958 --> 00:37:14,083
It will be terrific no matter what we do!

542
00:37:14,375 --> 00:37:15,500
You don't even have a plan yet,

543
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:17,083
and you want 2 wanted men around you?

544
00:37:17,083 --> 00:37:17,833
You know I will

545
00:37:17,833 --> 00:37:19,167
come up with a plan!

546
00:37:19,667 --> 00:37:21,875
This is the mountain I'm looking for.

547
00:37:21,875 --> 00:37:23,958
Himalaya!

548
00:37:52,583 --> 00:37:54,083
Having night snack?

549
00:37:54,375 --> 00:37:55,333
There's Coke in the fridge.

550
00:37:55,333 --> 00:37:57,042
OK, I'll get it myself.

551
00:38:10,292 --> 00:38:13,833
Fai, how long is your friend staying?

552
00:38:16,333 --> 00:38:18,125
3 or 4 nights.

553
00:38:18,458 --> 00:38:19,917
We have a daughter.

554
00:38:19,917 --> 00:38:21,792
I don't feel comfortable…

555
00:38:21,792 --> 00:38:23,750
with a guy suddenly staying with us.

556
00:38:24,708 --> 00:38:28,042
What does he do?

557
00:38:29,625 --> 00:38:32,833
He sells mobile phones.

558
00:38:32,833 --> 00:38:34,250
Don't worry.

559
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:36,250
Go to sleep.

560
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:36,792
OK.

561
00:38:36,792 --> 00:38:41,042
I'll go to bed after sewing.

562
00:38:47,208 --> 00:38:50,083
I will arrive with clients in 3 minutes.

563
00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:51,583
Got it.

564
00:38:55,208 --> 00:38:58,958
Gui, Guang, unload the goods. Be quick.

565
00:39:17,292 --> 00:39:18,500
Big Bro, we have a situation!

566
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:20,333
Panyu Customs!

567
00:39:21,708 --> 00:39:23,708
Kam! Kam!

568
00:39:23,708 --> 00:39:25,208
Chung, pull over!

569
00:39:29,667 --> 00:39:31,542
Take a look over there.

570
00:39:31,542 --> 00:39:32,917
Take a look again over there.

571
00:39:34,625 --> 00:39:36,125
Don't move. Hands on your head.

572
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:38,167
Let's go.

573
00:39:40,250 --> 00:39:41,583
Let's go.

574
00:39:42,417 --> 00:39:44,042
What about Kam?

575
00:39:44,042 --> 00:39:45,792
Find Mr Fong.

576
00:39:49,125 --> 00:39:52,542
Chinese customs

577
00:39:56,458 --> 00:39:57,958
Comrade.

578
00:39:57,958 --> 00:39:59,125
What do you want?

579
00:39:59,125 --> 00:40:00,708
We're looking for Chief Long.

580
00:40:00,708 --> 00:40:02,333
We're wondering

581
00:40:02,333 --> 00:40:06,542
if he can discharge the Lianhuashan goods and men?

582
00:40:11,667 --> 00:40:13,750
We know Mr Fong.

583
00:40:15,375 --> 00:40:17,417
In 4 days, the goods will be confiscated

584
00:40:17,417 --> 00:40:19,833
and the men will be executed.

585
00:40:20,375 --> 00:40:22,125
Yes, we understand.

586
00:40:43,208 --> 00:40:45,167
Chief, someone wants to see you.

587
00:40:45,167 --> 00:40:47,875
OK.

588
00:40:51,542 --> 00:40:53,208
Chief Long is busy today.

589
00:40:53,208 --> 00:40:54,708
Come again tomorrow.

590
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:13,500
All right. Yes…

591
00:41:18,167 --> 00:41:20,042
Chief Long is not seeing guests today.

592
00:41:20,042 --> 00:41:21,292
Come again tomorrow.

593
00:41:21,625 --> 00:41:22,458
Asshole.

594
00:41:22,458 --> 00:41:24,417
Who do you think you are?

595
00:41:25,458 --> 00:41:27,208
You don't want to save Kam anymore?

596
00:41:29,083 --> 00:41:30,750
Yes, yes.

597
00:41:36,708 --> 00:41:38,708
Chief Long said he wanted to talk over dinner.

598
00:41:38,708 --> 00:41:40,458
Find a restaurant and wait for him.

599
00:41:40,458 --> 00:41:41,583
Good.

600
00:41:41,583 --> 00:41:43,625
Fengman Restaurant.

601
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:53,542
Hello?

602
00:41:53,542 --> 00:41:55,625
I am in Fugui Restaurant with Chief Long.

603
00:41:55,917 --> 00:41:57,250
Coming right away.

604
00:41:57,250 --> 00:41:58,292
Let's go.

605
00:41:58,750 --> 00:42:00,500
Remember to bring a vase.

606
00:42:02,625 --> 00:42:03,500
Take the vase.

607
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:04,875
Quick!

608
00:42:04,875 --> 00:42:06,042
Okay!

609
00:42:12,167 --> 00:42:13,208
Hurry up!

610
00:42:14,792 --> 00:42:15,917
Chief Long of Customs.

611
00:42:15,917 --> 00:42:17,542
He's my buddy.

612
00:42:17,542 --> 00:42:19,167
Chief Long, nice to meet you.

613
00:42:19,167 --> 00:42:22,958
I'm an official but you made me wait!

614
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:25,333
Sorry,

615
00:42:25,333 --> 00:42:26,500
I went to Fengman Restaurant.

616
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:28,333
Is the food there edible?

617
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,208
He knows nothing about food!

618
00:42:31,208 --> 00:42:34,667
Chief Long is a foodie.

619
00:42:34,958 --> 00:42:36,542
Yes, you're right.

620
00:42:38,083 --> 00:42:40,833
Chief Long, he's my buddy.

621
00:42:40,833 --> 00:42:43,292
Help him this time.

622
00:42:43,708 --> 00:42:45,333
Thank you.

623
00:42:45,333 --> 00:42:47,625
He's your buddy, not mine.

624
00:42:47,875 --> 00:42:51,917
I only help my friends!

625
00:42:51,917 --> 00:42:54,917
If we hit it off, we're friends.

626
00:42:55,333 --> 00:42:56,500
I'm hungry!

627
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:57,250
Let's order first.

628
00:42:57,250 --> 00:42:59,583
Yes, let's order.

629
00:43:00,458 --> 00:43:02,667
What would you like?

630
00:43:02,667 --> 00:43:03,833
Braised pork with preserved vegetables.

631
00:43:03,833 --> 00:43:06,583
It's not refined enough for me.

632
00:43:07,208 --> 00:43:08,417
Let's order delicacies.

633
00:43:08,417 --> 00:43:09,958
Waiter!

634
00:43:17,250 --> 00:43:18,833
Thanks a lot.

635
00:43:21,208 --> 00:43:24,000
What's your name?

636
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,458
Boss Zhang.

637
00:43:25,792 --> 00:43:27,625
Boss Zhang, right?

638
00:43:28,208 --> 00:43:31,667
You're a fun guy! A fun guy!

639
00:43:31,667 --> 00:43:33,667
Thank you.

640
00:43:34,208 --> 00:43:36,792
Chief Long, thanks for your help.

641
00:43:37,333 --> 00:43:41,667
Let's sing karaoke first.

642
00:43:41,667 --> 00:43:43,625
OK, karaoke first.

643
00:43:45,042 --> 00:43:46,250
Chung

644
00:43:46,625 --> 00:43:48,833
Give me name cards of karaoke bars and the phone.

645
00:43:48,833 --> 00:43:49,833
Let's go for more fun.

646
00:43:49,833 --> 00:43:52,042
I can't…

647
00:43:53,917 --> 00:43:55,750
Let's take a bath.

648
00:43:57,042 --> 00:43:58,458
It's good to take a bath.

649
00:43:58,458 --> 00:44:00,458
Find a sauna.

650
00:44:03,542 --> 00:44:06,000
Don't forget the vase.

651
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,417
Yes.

652
00:44:16,625 --> 00:44:19,667
Chinese customs

653
00:44:19,667 --> 00:44:22,375
Thanks to connections,
I didn't need to rot in jail.

654
00:44:22,708 --> 00:44:24,250
We stayed in a motel,

655
00:44:24,250 --> 00:44:26,792
with a bed, TV, OK food,

656
00:44:26,792 --> 00:44:28,375
though no whores!

657
00:44:28,542 --> 00:44:30,125
It's not bad, huh? What do you say?

658
00:44:30,125 --> 00:44:31,500
Yes, yes.

659
00:44:33,875 --> 00:44:36,792
Asshole, you didn't need to carouse
with those officials!

660
00:44:37,208 --> 00:44:39,083
Don't complain about carousing,

661
00:44:39,083 --> 00:44:40,583
for money's sake.

662
00:44:43,958 --> 00:44:45,750
Hey! Come here.

663
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:47,500
Our goods!

664
00:44:53,750 --> 00:44:55,083
Come.

665
00:44:55,750 --> 00:44:59,625
Your goods are here.

666
00:45:00,208 --> 00:45:01,500
Take a look. Any problems?

667
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:04,000
Thanks so much.

668
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
Let me take a look.

669
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:10,417
Sign here if there's no problem.

670
00:45:10,417 --> 00:45:11,958
Thanks so much.

671
00:45:34,167 --> 00:45:35,625
OK.

672
00:47:38,792 --> 00:47:41,833
Your mole hasn't found Kwai's dossier

673
00:47:41,833 --> 00:47:43,208
in the police station?

674
00:47:49,792 --> 00:47:53,250
No news about Yip in China?

675
00:47:56,542 --> 00:47:59,125
What about his underlings? His fences?

676
00:47:59,125 --> 00:48:02,667
His fellow illegal immigrants? His village mates?

677
00:48:03,042 --> 00:48:04,583
Can't find them?

678
00:48:05,792 --> 00:48:07,125
Nothing at all?

679
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:12,708
Good.

680
00:48:14,083 --> 00:48:15,458
Good.

681
00:48:25,375 --> 00:48:26,750
Fuck you!

682
00:48:27,250 --> 00:48:29,167
Fuck you!

683
00:48:30,750 --> 00:48:33,250
The cops have offered a $1M reward on him.

684
00:48:33,250 --> 00:48:34,833
But there's no news over these years.

685
00:48:34,833 --> 00:48:37,375
Give me some time.

686
00:48:37,375 --> 00:48:39,500
Reward money is a good idea.

687
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,542
The cops offer $1M; I'll up it to $10M!

688
00:48:43,542 --> 00:48:45,417
If it's not enough, then $1OOM!

689
00:48:45,875 --> 00:48:47,708
I'll set up a special phone line.

690
00:48:47,708 --> 00:48:51,125
Whoever knows their
whereabouts will get the money.

691
00:48:52,583 --> 00:48:55,292
So brazenly? The cops will tap the phone.

692
00:48:55,292 --> 00:48:59,000
Those assholes will prevent the 3 Kings
from meeting up.

693
00:48:59,375 --> 00:49:00,917
Not necessarily.

694
00:49:01,542 --> 00:49:03,583
The cops want them too.

695
00:49:03,583 --> 00:49:05,792
They will send loads of people after us.

696
00:49:06,625 --> 00:49:08,875
Find a way to shake them off.

697
00:49:16,750 --> 00:49:17,708
Hello?

698
00:49:17,708 --> 00:49:18,667
Are you Cheuk?

699
00:49:18,667 --> 00:49:19,417
Yes.

700
00:49:23,833 --> 00:49:26,042
Noon tomorrow. Bring a purple umbrella
to Temple Street.

701
00:49:26,042 --> 00:49:27,333
I'll have you picked up.

702
00:49:28,125 --> 00:49:29,250
Get on.

703
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:33,958
Take off your clothes.

704
00:49:33,958 --> 00:49:34,792
Take them all off.

705
00:50:01,292 --> 00:50:04,667
I worked with Kwai once. He's so average.

706
00:50:04,667 --> 00:50:08,583
I know Yip. He lived in Guangdong.

707
00:50:08,583 --> 00:50:09,875
Kwai's real name is Xing Zhennan.

708
00:50:09,875 --> 00:50:11,333
His ancestral house was built by me.

709
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:12,583
Yes.

710
00:50:13,583 --> 00:50:14,292
OK.

711
00:50:34,625 --> 00:50:37,542
I drove for Yip and was chased by the cops.

712
00:50:37,542 --> 00:50:39,000
I fenced for Yip.

713
00:50:39,042 --> 00:50:40,500
I was present in Yip's every heist.

714
00:50:40,542 --> 00:50:41,542
We wielded AK-47 together.

715
00:50:41,583 --> 00:50:44,250
Mr Cheuk, I envy you. I admire all your works.

716
00:50:44,250 --> 00:50:46,750
Yip bought sex from me.

717
00:50:46,750 --> 00:50:49,375
He was loud and proud.

718
00:50:51,708 --> 00:50:54,667
Heists? Hong Kong kids?

719
00:50:54,667 --> 00:50:57,833
These barking dogs are sneaky wussies.

720
00:50:57,833 --> 00:51:02,500
I imported the Chinese
retired soldiers to Hong Kong.

721
00:51:03,083 --> 00:51:05,917
What did I teach them before a heist?

722
00:51:05,917 --> 00:51:07,958
Moral principle!

723
00:51:07,958 --> 00:51:10,042
Father of the Chinese retired soldiers,

724
00:51:10,042 --> 00:51:11,500
can you cut to the chase?

725
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:13,750
Do you know Yip or Kwai?

726
00:51:13,750 --> 00:51:16,625
Don't interrupt me when I talk.

727
00:51:16,833 --> 00:51:19,167
If I talk too fast, you won't understand!

728
00:51:19,750 --> 00:51:21,208
Where was I?

729
00:51:21,625 --> 00:51:23,167
Moral principle.

730
00:51:23,167 --> 00:51:28,083
I once brought 3 Mainlanders

731
00:51:28,083 --> 00:51:32,083
to a showdown with the cops. Bang!

732
00:51:32,083 --> 00:51:35,000
One of them, Wei,
was so scared he dropped his gun!

733
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,917
You know what? I rushed to save him!

734
00:51:37,917 --> 00:51:41,500
He owes me a lot.

735
00:51:42,292 --> 00:51:44,292
Know who Kun-xi is?

736
00:51:47,250 --> 00:51:48,875
Yip's former boss?

737
00:51:50,417 --> 00:51:53,458
Quincy is Wei's godson.

738
00:51:53,458 --> 00:51:54,917
Want to meet him?

739
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,250
<i>'MM'.!</i>

740
00:51:59,125 --> 00:52:00,375
You better check him out thoroughly.

741
00:52:00,375 --> 00:52:02,333
Check me out? Motherfucker.

742
00:52:02,750 --> 00:52:04,333
It's just $1M.

743
00:52:04,917 --> 00:52:06,292
Act fast.

744
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,083
Quincy will stand in front of you tomorrow.

745
00:52:09,083 --> 00:52:10,375
Give me the dough.

746
00:52:26,833 --> 00:52:27,833
Hey.

747
00:52:29,958 --> 00:52:31,583
Thanks so much!

748
00:52:32,583 --> 00:52:34,250
Let's go have some fun?

749
00:52:53,875 --> 00:52:57,083
Are you tight in cash lately, Taishan Boy?

750
00:52:57,083 --> 00:52:59,875
How can 3 pieces be enough?

751
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:14,042
Guns are for firing, not for sniffing.

752
00:53:20,750 --> 00:53:24,167
Our commander taught us: safety first.

753
00:53:24,792 --> 00:53:30,167
Have you sniffed that Cheuk
is looking for Yip and Kwai?

754
00:53:31,417 --> 00:53:35,833
Mr Cheuk says he wants to meet those two.

755
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:39,083
Look, he has set up a special phone line.

756
00:53:39,083 --> 00:53:41,625
Info for money.

757
00:53:41,625 --> 00:53:43,417
How generous!

758
00:53:45,167 --> 00:53:47,125
Both of them are very dangerous.

759
00:53:47,708 --> 00:53:50,667
Which kingpin is not dangerous?

760
00:53:50,667 --> 00:53:52,750
They are being so brazenly?

761
00:53:52,750 --> 00:53:54,417
The Handover is imminent.

762
00:53:54,417 --> 00:53:57,292
Because the Handover is imminent,
you have to do big!

763
00:53:57,292 --> 00:54:01,375
After the Handover,
it will be slim pickings, Idiot.

764
00:54:02,792 --> 00:54:04,167
Listen.

765
00:54:04,167 --> 00:54:05,542
Sniff out their whereabouts.

766
00:54:05,542 --> 00:54:09,250
The restoration of this
Association depends on you!

767
00:54:10,083 --> 00:54:14,208
Keep me posted, kiddo.

768
00:54:14,208 --> 00:54:16,958
Keep me posted!

769
00:54:30,583 --> 00:54:31,583
Stand still, sir.

770
00:54:31,583 --> 00:54:32,667
What's wrong?

771
00:54:32,667 --> 00:54:33,292
Where are you going?

772
00:54:33,292 --> 00:54:34,583
Home.

773
00:54:34,583 --> 00:54:36,000
Your ID, please.

774
00:54:43,417 --> 00:54:44,333
Bo!

775
00:54:44,333 --> 00:54:47,042
Why didn't you come home right after school?

776
00:54:47,042 --> 00:54:49,250
I told you so many times.

777
00:54:49,542 --> 00:54:51,083
Where have you been?

778
00:54:51,083 --> 00:54:53,500
We've been looking for you everywhere.

779
00:54:54,750 --> 00:54:57,458
Bro Coke, you should've told us beforehand.

780
00:54:57,458 --> 00:54:59,583
- I thought I was on my way.
- You've scared the hell out of us.

781
00:55:10,792 --> 00:55:12,417
Shut up!

782
00:55:14,042 --> 00:55:15,917
Still drinking? Bad girl!

783
00:55:15,917 --> 00:55:17,333
What happened?

784
00:55:19,875 --> 00:55:21,500
She's naughty.

785
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:23,625
Teach your girl at home, not on the street.

786
00:55:23,625 --> 00:55:25,042
- I'm sorry.
- You've frightened her.

787
00:55:25,042 --> 00:55:27,417
Yes, I'm sorry.

788
00:55:27,958 --> 00:55:29,458
Let's go home.

789
00:55:30,208 --> 00:55:31,417
Thank you, sir.

790
00:55:46,125 --> 00:55:47,500
Sorry.

791
00:55:56,917 --> 00:55:58,208
Darling.

792
00:55:58,875 --> 00:56:00,292
Daddy loves you.

793
00:56:00,292 --> 00:56:01,333
My good girl.

794
00:56:03,792 --> 00:56:05,125
3 Days!

795
00:56:05,125 --> 00:56:08,750
Chief Song helped us recover the goods in 3 days.

796
00:56:08,750 --> 00:56:11,417
Chief Song, my buddy!

797
00:56:11,417 --> 00:56:12,542
You rock!

798
00:56:12,958 --> 00:56:19,458
It's incumbent on the police to maintain order.

799
00:56:19,458 --> 00:56:20,708
Boss Zhang,

800
00:56:20,917 --> 00:56:23,125
can you do me a favor?

801
00:56:29,667 --> 00:56:30,792
Go!

802
00:56:37,875 --> 00:56:39,792
Let him vent his anger.

803
00:56:40,583 --> 00:56:41,667
Stop!

804
00:56:56,833 --> 00:57:01,083
Chief Song, you're a tea connoisseur.

805
00:57:05,917 --> 00:57:07,458
Enough.

806
00:57:09,458 --> 00:57:11,250
I need you to do me a favor.

807
00:57:11,250 --> 00:57:12,750
What do you mean?

808
00:57:13,667 --> 00:57:18,208
They are the sons of my ex-commander's friend.

809
00:57:18,625 --> 00:57:20,708
Forgive them.

810
00:57:21,750 --> 00:57:23,750
Give me face.

811
00:57:27,833 --> 00:57:29,500
They robbed me.

812
00:57:30,958 --> 00:57:33,708
What have you lost?

813
00:57:35,042 --> 00:57:37,292
They robbed me! Me!

814
00:57:38,958 --> 00:57:41,083
We're good buddies.

815
00:57:41,083 --> 00:57:43,000
Who do you think you are?

816
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,750
A pet it bourgeois!

817
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:49,917
A greedy, smuggling, tax-evading pet it bourgeois!

818
00:57:50,750 --> 00:57:53,000
Don't think too highly of yourself.

819
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:56,417
We're good buddies.

820
00:57:56,708 --> 00:57:58,250
Take them away!

821
00:57:59,250 --> 00:58:01,458
We're good buddies.

822
00:58:02,958 --> 00:58:04,417
Shoot him,

823
00:58:04,417 --> 00:58:06,708
I'll act according to the law!

824
00:58:22,833 --> 00:58:23,625
Great, there's a vase in the toilet…

825
00:58:23,625 --> 00:58:24,667
We're lucky…

826
00:58:24,667 --> 00:58:26,333
It's small but it will do.

827
00:58:55,417 --> 00:58:57,583
We're good buddies.

828
00:59:23,375 --> 00:59:25,667
RMB¥2M, thank you!

829
00:59:25,667 --> 00:59:27,083
I receive RMB¥1.3M from you. Thanks.

830
00:59:27,083 --> 00:59:28,292
I'll notify you once we have the goods.

831
00:59:28,292 --> 00:59:29,500
Next.

832
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:30,875
Take your time.

833
00:59:30,875 --> 00:59:32,417
It's insane!!

834
00:59:32,417 --> 00:59:34,625
Everyone out.

835
00:59:34,625 --> 00:59:36,917
Get out!

836
00:59:37,125 --> 00:59:39,458
It's insane!!

837
00:59:39,458 --> 00:59:40,375
What happened?

838
00:59:40,375 --> 00:59:42,833
Bro foon, Cheuk has gone mad!

839
00:59:42,833 --> 00:59:45,917
He set up a special phone line to look for you.

840
01:00:01,208 --> 01:00:02,708
Inspector Wu.

841
01:00:03,083 --> 01:00:05,333
You're difficult to tail.

842
01:00:05,333 --> 01:00:07,000
I had to wait here for you!

843
01:00:07,458 --> 01:00:08,792
I caught this guy for you.

844
01:00:08,792 --> 01:00:11,958
He said you gave him $1M for Kun-xi's whereabouts.

845
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:15,792
Is it a crime to look for someone?

846
01:00:15,792 --> 01:00:17,917
No.

847
01:00:17,917 --> 01:00:19,750
But have you checked him out?

848
01:00:19,750 --> 01:00:22,042
He's been in jail for 20 years.

849
01:00:22,042 --> 01:00:24,792
The phone numbers back then only had 6 digits!

850
01:00:24,792 --> 01:00:25,958
He's out of touch now!

851
01:00:25,958 --> 01:00:26,833
Out of touch?

852
01:00:26,833 --> 01:00:29,250
If I go to China, Wei will pick me up!

853
01:00:29,250 --> 01:00:30,208
Wei?

854
01:00:30,208 --> 01:00:32,000
He was shot dead two years ago!

855
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,958
Kun-xi betrayed him!

856
01:00:34,667 --> 01:00:35,750
Have you been conned?

857
01:00:35,750 --> 01:00:37,500
I can arrest him now if you have.

858
01:00:37,833 --> 01:00:39,500
An eye for an eye.

859
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:40,417
That's moral principle.

860
01:00:40,417 --> 01:00:41,417
Calm down!

861
01:00:41,417 --> 01:00:43,167
I'm very calm.

862
01:00:43,792 --> 01:00:46,042
Or I'd have kicked you too!

863
01:00:49,583 --> 01:00:51,125
Want to report the crime?

864
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:53,875
If not, I'll let him go.

865
01:00:54,667 --> 01:00:55,708
Well?

866
01:00:58,875 --> 01:01:01,917
If not, I'll let him go!

867
01:01:01,917 --> 01:01:02,875
Get lost!

868
01:01:02,875 --> 01:01:04,042
- Are you assaulting a police officer?
- Don't play tricks.

869
01:01:04,042 --> 01:01:06,167
So what? Motherfucker!

870
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:07,792
Don't give up,

871
01:01:07,792 --> 01:01:09,250
keep searching for him.

872
01:01:09,250 --> 01:01:13,958
The Royal Hong Kong Police relies
on your phone calls.

873
01:01:22,958 --> 01:01:24,708
Why don't you just drop it?

874
01:01:25,250 --> 01:01:28,667
Don't ruin your impeccable record.

875
01:01:30,333 --> 01:01:32,250
I'd help you if I could!

876
01:01:33,333 --> 01:01:34,708
Even if you were to hit me,

877
01:01:34,708 --> 01:01:38,250
I must say it's a dead end!

878
01:01:43,208 --> 01:01:45,083
I know, I know!

879
01:01:45,417 --> 01:01:47,458
We've come to the climax of tonight.

880
01:01:47,458 --> 01:01:49,083
The last leg of the Triple Trio.

881
01:01:49,083 --> 01:01:53,125
The $170M jackpot pool.

882
01:01:53,125 --> 01:01:56,583
Plus the total bet amount. A single winner

883
01:01:56,583 --> 01:01:59,583
can collect over $300M.

884
01:01:59,583 --> 01:02:02,625
Many horse racing fans are placing bets.

885
01:02:02,625 --> 01:02:03,958
The whole city is abuzz!

886
01:02:03,958 --> 01:02:06,500
A single winning ticket will make
you richer than any kings.

887
01:02:06,500 --> 01:02:08,000
See if you can win.

888
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:12,708
Bets are placed on Wind Chaser.

889
01:02:13,083 --> 01:02:14,292
Gold Weather is the horse least expected to win.

890
01:02:14,292 --> 01:02:17,958
The odds are 99.

891
01:02:18,833 --> 01:02:20,417
Win & Place.

892
01:02:23,958 --> 01:02:27,208
Motherfucker, almost $400M in the pool.

893
01:02:27,833 --> 01:02:30,667
Hong Kong citizens are robbed by the Triple Trio.

894
01:02:32,083 --> 01:02:34,333
What does Triple Trio mean?

895
01:02:35,542 --> 01:02:39,042
The $170M jackpot pool

896
01:02:39,042 --> 01:02:41,125
has attracted many fans queuing
to place their bets.

897
01:03:01,875 --> 01:03:02,625
No more clothes pegs?

898
01:03:02,625 --> 01:03:03,333
No.

899
01:03:03,333 --> 01:03:04,167
Go get some in the room.

900
01:03:04,167 --> 01:03:05,375
Sure.

901
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
The race is about to start.

902
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:07,000
The $170M jackpot pool.

903
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:08,250
A single winner

904
01:04:08,250 --> 01:04:10,083
can collect over $300M!

905
01:04:10,208 --> 01:04:12,125
Who will be the lucky one?

906
01:04:12,208 --> 01:04:14,208
A dark horse will increase the size

907
01:04:14,208 --> 01:04:16,000
of the betting pool.

908
01:04:16,250 --> 01:04:18,833
The horses are in the stalls and ready to go.

909
01:04:18,833 --> 01:04:20,625
Which horse will take off first?

910
01:04:20,625 --> 01:04:22,833
It's Wind Chaser.

911
01:04:22,833 --> 01:04:24,625
It runs faster and faster.

912
01:04:24,625 --> 01:04:25,917
The rest can hardly catch up.

913
01:04:25,917 --> 01:04:29,167
<i>Go'. Go'. Go'.!</i>

914
01:04:32,375 --> 01:04:39,417
Faster! Faster! Faster!

915
01:04:42,667 --> 01:04:46,250
No one wins. The warehouse
must be filled with money.

916
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:08,750
Big Bro Chiu.

917
01:06:57,333 --> 01:06:58,000
Hey.

918
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:01,708
Mr Cheuk, you know who Kun-xi is?

919
01:07:02,208 --> 01:07:04,500
It's Kun-xi speaking.

920
01:07:04,500 --> 01:07:08,708
Look me up in Guangdong. I won't let you down.

921
01:07:19,958 --> 01:07:23,333
You're really quitting? It's a cushy job.

922
01:07:23,333 --> 01:07:24,750
You're telling me!

923
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:27,625
Talk to Big Bro yourself.

924
01:07:28,708 --> 01:07:33,958
I have invested all I got in the goods.

925
01:07:39,208 --> 01:07:42,750
You already know all those officials

926
01:07:42,750 --> 01:07:44,750
and connections well…

927
01:07:44,917 --> 01:07:46,333
What did you say?

928
01:07:47,833 --> 01:07:49,208
Fisherman!

929
01:07:49,208 --> 01:07:50,583
Yes, Bro foon.

930
01:07:52,875 --> 01:07:54,667
Give me Cheuk's number.

931
01:07:55,917 --> 01:07:57,167
Bro foon.

932
01:07:57,167 --> 01:07:58,833
You got something to say?

933
01:07:58,833 --> 01:08:00,208
No.

934
01:08:00,208 --> 01:08:01,708
Give me the number!

935
01:08:01,708 --> 01:08:03,042
Sure.

936
01:08:11,708 --> 01:08:15,833
Fuck! Thought I would be famous overnight.

937
01:08:16,250 --> 01:08:17,667
What a waste of time!

938
01:08:19,917 --> 01:08:21,792
Fame is not an issue.

939
01:08:21,792 --> 01:08:24,750
I can't just go back empty-handed.

940
01:08:24,750 --> 01:08:26,875
Not to mention having to chew this bread here.

941
01:08:35,083 --> 01:08:36,625
Big Bro Chiu,

942
01:08:36,625 --> 01:08:39,000
coming to Hong Kong has not been easy for us.

943
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:42,167
We can't just go back like this.

944
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:53,167
Big Bro Chiu, you really want us to leave?

945
01:08:56,958 --> 01:08:59,042
If you guys have something big in mind,

946
01:08:59,042 --> 01:09:00,917
count us in!

947
01:09:00,917 --> 01:09:02,917
We can do anything.

948
01:09:06,250 --> 01:09:07,917
I can keep a secret.

949
01:09:07,917 --> 01:09:10,375
If you say you're Big Bro Chiu, then so be it.

950
01:09:10,375 --> 01:09:12,750
I understand. Don't worry.

951
01:09:13,083 --> 01:09:16,792
I know the rules. It's between you and me.

952
01:09:17,250 --> 01:09:19,375
We have moral principle.

953
01:09:33,167 --> 01:09:34,417
Share it.

954
01:09:47,917 --> 01:09:49,625
Seriously, we can make it work.

955
01:09:49,625 --> 01:09:51,208
The 3 Kings of Thieves join forces…

956
01:10:27,917 --> 01:10:32,333
Mind your own business.

957
01:11:00,833 --> 01:11:02,833
Aren't you on dialysis? Still smoking?

958
01:11:06,250 --> 01:11:08,792
Old habits die hard.

959
01:11:12,750 --> 01:11:14,958
Are you still angry with me?

960
01:11:14,958 --> 01:11:17,667
You're planning to rob the gold shop downstairs?

961
01:11:23,375 --> 01:11:25,583
I thought you're paying me a visit.

962
01:11:26,167 --> 01:11:28,083
You're here just for the location.

963
01:11:29,500 --> 01:11:30,167
Listen to me…

964
01:11:30,167 --> 01:11:31,250
No more!

965
01:11:31,250 --> 01:11:31,708
Listen to me…

966
01:11:31,708 --> 01:11:33,167
I treat you as my brother. You treat me as a fool!

967
01:11:33,167 --> 01:11:33,792
I never treat you as a fool.

968
01:11:33,792 --> 01:11:35,958
Forget it! Just shut up!

969
01:11:37,792 --> 01:11:40,333
I have a wife and a daughter now.

970
01:11:40,875 --> 01:11:43,208
My life is great.

971
01:11:43,208 --> 01:11:45,750
Can you leave my family alone?

972
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:59,792
I'm in the wrong this time.

973
01:12:04,917 --> 01:12:07,417
You know it's hard to make a living.

974
01:12:16,500 --> 01:12:18,250
We're sworn brothers.

975
01:12:19,792 --> 01:12:21,625
I owe you this time.

976
01:12:24,875 --> 01:12:27,792
Forget what happened these past few days.

977
01:12:28,875 --> 01:12:30,583
Keep it to yourself.

978
01:12:52,750 --> 01:12:54,375
I'll leave early tomorrow morning.

979
01:12:54,667 --> 01:12:56,625
You won't see me again.

980
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:17,750
Uncle Coke.

981
01:13:20,708 --> 01:13:22,125
Not in bed yet?

982
01:13:35,417 --> 01:13:38,083
Guangdong province

983
01:13:45,833 --> 01:13:49,917
Sai Wan Container Terminal, Hong Kong

984
01:14:56,208 --> 01:14:57,333
Mr Cheuk,

985
01:14:57,333 --> 01:14:59,125
I've heard so much about you.

986
01:15:03,083 --> 01:15:04,333
Where's Yip?

987
01:15:04,792 --> 01:15:07,792
Let me show you something.

988
01:15:07,792 --> 01:15:09,083
This way.

989
01:15:11,792 --> 01:15:14,750
Mr Cheuk. How's your journey?

990
01:15:14,750 --> 01:15:16,958
I'll treat you to something special.

991
01:15:16,958 --> 01:15:19,833
Shrimps and crabs are local specialties.

992
01:15:19,833 --> 01:15:23,125
After food we'll find two shampoo girls for you.

993
01:15:23,125 --> 01:15:25,167
This way, please.

994
01:15:26,958 --> 01:15:30,583
Type 54 pistols, grenades, AK weapons.

995
01:15:30,583 --> 01:15:32,292
I've got all you want.

996
01:15:32,542 --> 01:15:33,958
Where's Yip?

997
01:15:35,875 --> 01:15:39,333
The truck outside holds a ton of dynamite.

998
01:15:40,042 --> 01:15:41,583
Bang!

999
01:15:41,583 --> 01:15:43,083
You can blow up whatever you want.

1000
01:15:44,125 --> 01:15:46,042
Where's Yip?

1001
01:15:51,417 --> 01:15:53,250
They were all retired soldiers.

1002
01:15:53,250 --> 01:15:54,833
They're fearless veterans in battles!

1003
01:15:54,833 --> 01:15:56,542
I want Yip!

1004
01:16:01,833 --> 01:16:03,083
Coin!

1005
01:16:10,167 --> 01:16:11,292
Give it to me!

1006
01:16:15,875 --> 01:16:18,542
Big Bro, let's think it through.

1007
01:16:18,542 --> 01:16:20,042
Give it to me!

1008
01:16:20,625 --> 01:16:21,542
We're doing all right.

1009
01:16:21,542 --> 01:16:23,583
Why go back to our old business?

1010
01:16:24,542 --> 01:16:25,667
Are you lecturing me?

1011
01:16:25,667 --> 01:16:27,583
We're making money!

1012
01:16:27,583 --> 01:16:29,333
We can't be robbers for the rest of our lives!

1013
01:16:29,333 --> 01:16:31,208
You do it!

1014
01:16:31,208 --> 01:16:32,958
You have struck a deal with the Fisherman!

1015
01:16:34,125 --> 01:16:36,458
Big Bro, he was just thinking out loud.

1016
01:16:36,458 --> 01:16:37,792
Leave if you want!

1017
01:16:37,792 --> 01:16:39,125
I won't stop you!

1018
01:16:39,125 --> 01:16:41,083
Do you know what time it is? You don't sleep?

1019
01:16:41,083 --> 01:16:42,958
Go fuck yourself!

1020
01:16:44,500 --> 01:16:45,958
Fuck you!

1021
01:16:45,958 --> 01:16:46,875
Come down!

1022
01:17:02,167 --> 01:17:04,375
Yip has retired!

1023
01:17:04,375 --> 01:17:06,083
He used to be my man!

1024
01:17:06,083 --> 01:17:07,167
Am I not a better partner?

1025
01:17:07,167 --> 01:17:09,458
Who the hell are you?

1026
01:17:14,333 --> 01:17:15,083
Hello?

1027
01:17:15,083 --> 01:17:16,917
Hello, Cheuk.

1028
01:17:16,917 --> 01:17:18,792
It's Yip Kwok-foon speaking.

1029
01:17:22,125 --> 01:17:23,208
Are you kidding me?

1030
01:17:24,042 --> 01:17:25,708
Why should I believe you?

1031
01:17:25,708 --> 01:17:27,833
I am who I am!

1032
01:17:27,833 --> 01:17:29,542
If you don't believe me, let's meet up!

1033
01:17:30,875 --> 01:17:32,333
Wait. Got another call.

1034
01:17:32,333 --> 01:17:33,000
Fuck you!

1035
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:34,417
Wait for what? Hello?

1036
01:17:34,958 --> 01:17:35,667
Hello?

1037
01:17:35,958 --> 01:17:36,792
Hey!

1038
01:17:37,250 --> 01:17:37,875
Hey!

1039
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:43,083
You are dead!

1040
01:17:43,500 --> 01:17:44,750
Go up!

1041
01:17:44,917 --> 01:17:46,000
Go up!

1042
01:17:48,208 --> 01:17:49,167
Hello?

1043
01:17:49,792 --> 01:17:51,000
Speak!

1044
01:17:51,542 --> 01:17:53,208
Are you Cheuk?

1045
01:17:54,042 --> 01:17:55,000
Who's speaking?

1046
01:18:01,042 --> 01:18:02,500
Kwai Ching-hung.

1047
01:18:04,958 --> 01:18:06,542
Need my help?

1048
01:18:07,958 --> 01:18:09,542
Are you kidding me?

1049
01:18:11,292 --> 01:18:13,333
Do you have any proof?

1050
01:18:14,250 --> 01:18:17,083
I robbed Tung Shing Watch in 1986.

1051
01:18:17,875 --> 01:18:19,375
I killed 3 plainclothes

1052
01:18:19,375 --> 01:18:21,042
in 1988.

1053
01:18:21,333 --> 01:18:22,625
And Landmark in 1992…

1054
01:18:23,875 --> 01:18:27,458
Wasn't it Yip who robbed Landmark in 1992!

1055
01:18:29,875 --> 01:18:31,958
Don't be so gullible.

1056
01:18:32,583 --> 01:18:36,083
Jumbo Watch in 1994
and Lucky Guy Jewellery two years ago.

1057
01:18:36,083 --> 01:18:37,833
I did them all.

1058
01:18:37,833 --> 01:18:39,875
Do you think only Yip had AK-47?

1059
01:18:39,875 --> 01:18:42,583
He loved to be on camera
and the cops were dumb.

1060
01:18:42,583 --> 01:18:45,792
- I just took advantage of the situation…
- Hold on! Don't hang up.

1061
01:18:58,333 --> 01:18:59,667
What did you just say?

1062
01:18:59,667 --> 01:19:00,500
Fuck you!

1063
01:19:00,500 --> 01:19:01,250
Are you playing me?

1064
01:19:03,417 --> 01:19:06,250
It's you, Yip!

1065
01:19:08,458 --> 01:19:11,625
Landmark in 1992, Jumbo in 1994,
and Lucky Guy two years ago.

1066
01:19:11,625 --> 01:19:12,458
Are you responsible for all?

1067
01:19:12,458 --> 01:19:13,500
No!

1068
01:19:13,500 --> 01:19:14,500
I never did my jobs in clandestine!

1069
01:19:14,667 --> 01:19:17,292
Why should I hide myself?

1070
01:19:52,583 --> 01:19:53,542
We're all here.

1071
01:19:53,792 --> 01:19:54,750
Where are you right now?

1072
01:19:54,750 --> 01:19:56,125
Hong Kong!

1073
01:19:57,417 --> 01:19:59,292
I'll call you when I'm back in Hong Kong.

1074
01:20:22,792 --> 01:20:23,792
Hello?

1075
01:20:27,042 --> 01:20:28,042
Hello?

1076
01:20:33,375 --> 01:20:34,542
Hello?

1077
01:20:34,542 --> 01:20:36,625
Kwai Ching-hung, you still there?

1078
01:20:37,292 --> 01:20:37,917
Hello?

1079
01:20:37,917 --> 01:20:38,583
Yes.

1080
01:20:39,417 --> 01:20:40,917
Where are you?

1081
01:20:43,708 --> 01:20:44,625
Hong Kong.

1082
01:20:49,458 --> 01:20:51,417
Call you when I'm back in Hong Kong.

1083
01:20:51,417 --> 01:20:52,625
Let's talk later.

1084
01:21:03,333 --> 01:21:04,875
Motherfucker! The 3 Kings

1085
01:21:04,875 --> 01:21:06,208
of Thieves have nothing to do with you.

1086
01:21:06,875 --> 01:21:08,542
Since you're here,

1087
01:21:09,583 --> 01:21:11,625
you can't bail without leaving something.

1088
01:21:16,833 --> 01:21:18,000
Yes.

1089
01:21:39,708 --> 01:21:41,750
There's less than $10M here.

1090
01:21:42,500 --> 01:21:44,375
Mr Cheuk's life

1091
01:21:46,167 --> 01:21:48,583
worth at least $100M!

1092
01:22:00,542 --> 01:22:01,542
Put your guns down!

1093
01:22:04,250 --> 01:22:06,625
Retired soldiers? Go!

1094
01:22:11,917 --> 01:22:13,042
Car key.

1095
01:22:13,750 --> 01:22:15,042
Car key!

1096
01:22:29,583 --> 01:22:31,583
You think I'm bullshitting?

1097
01:22:33,500 --> 01:22:35,417
If you don't treat me as your Big Bro,
let's split!

1098
01:22:36,250 --> 01:22:38,375
Big Bro, we always follow your orders.

1099
01:22:38,375 --> 01:22:40,500
You said “drop the guns,” we dropped the guns.

1100
01:22:40,500 --> 01:22:41,458
Is that very hard for you?

1101
01:22:41,458 --> 01:22:43,750
No, we always follow you, Big Bro.

1102
01:22:43,750 --> 01:22:45,500
We support you no matter what!

1103
01:22:49,417 --> 01:22:50,917
Are you looking down on me?

1104
01:22:51,250 --> 01:22:53,125
I stoop so low that I need your support?

1105
01:22:53,625 --> 01:22:54,917
I don't need you!

1106
01:22:54,917 --> 01:22:56,750
You're just my followers!

1107
01:22:59,167 --> 01:23:00,708
Hey you!

1108
01:23:02,208 --> 01:23:03,500
What are you fighting for?

1109
01:23:03,500 --> 01:23:06,667
Sorry, we're tourists.

1110
01:23:06,667 --> 01:23:10,458
We got lost, so we quarreled.

1111
01:23:10,458 --> 01:23:12,417
The residents upstairs filed a complaint.

1112
01:23:13,375 --> 01:23:14,958
- Where are your IDs?
- Here.

1113
01:23:23,167 --> 01:23:26,167
We planned to take a boat to Macau

1114
01:23:26,958 --> 01:23:28,375
but got lost here.

1115
01:23:28,375 --> 01:23:30,000
We couldn't find the pier.

1116
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:33,000
So we quarreled.

1117
01:23:35,583 --> 01:23:36,750
Call the station.

1118
01:23:37,542 --> 01:23:40,208
PC1844 calling the station. Send.

1119
01:23:45,500 --> 01:23:47,583
Quick!

1120
01:23:47,583 --> 01:23:49,375
Don't let him flee!

1121
01:23:49,375 --> 01:23:50,750
Motherfucker!

1122
01:23:51,833 --> 01:23:53,750
He's in the front!

1123
01:23:54,292 --> 01:23:55,500
Go after him!

1124
01:24:22,167 --> 01:24:24,125
Hello? Uncle Dog, I've found them.

1125
01:24:24,417 --> 01:24:26,792
Believe it or not, they called me up!

1126
01:24:26,792 --> 01:24:28,333
I even got a whole ton of dynamite!

1127
01:24:28,333 --> 01:24:30,500
It will work this time. Get me a boat.

1128
01:24:30,500 --> 01:24:32,667
I have an idea!

1129
01:24:32,667 --> 01:24:34,042
We'll blow up the Handover ceremony!

1130
01:24:34,042 --> 01:24:36,042
We can threaten either the British queen
or the Chinese government.

1131
01:24:36,042 --> 01:24:38,042
It will create a stir for sure!

1132
01:24:38,042 --> 01:24:39,292
What the fuck!

1133
01:25:27,417 --> 01:25:28,750
The night snack is here. Back yet?

1134
01:25:28,750 --> 01:25:29,625
Coming back.

1135
01:25:29,667 --> 01:25:31,958
We're at the entrance
to the complainant's building.

1136
01:25:32,333 --> 01:25:35,167
It's quiet. No one's here. OVER.

1137
01:25:36,583 --> 01:25:39,875
Be civilized. Don't talk too loud.

1138
01:25:39,875 --> 01:25:42,375
If you go to Macau, take the ferry in Sheung Wan.

1139
01:25:42,833 --> 01:25:44,083
This is Sai Wan.

1140
01:25:44,083 --> 01:25:44,958
Oh.

1141
01:25:45,375 --> 01:25:48,042
Go to the main street and take a cab.

1142
01:25:48,333 --> 01:25:49,167
Take a cab!

1143
01:25:53,875 --> 01:25:56,500
Mainlanders are numskulls.

1144
01:28:36,167 --> 01:28:37,292
Quick!

1145
01:28:45,292 --> 01:28:46,875
Mainlanders?

1146
01:28:47,500 --> 01:28:49,333
I'm Yip Kwok-foon!

1147
01:30:01,583 --> 01:30:04,333
Military Police

1148
01:31:26,083 --> 01:31:26,958
Waiter.

1149
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:29,875
Sir, have you reserved a table?

1150
01:31:29,875 --> 01:31:31,417
I booked a room under the name of Chen.

1151
01:31:31,417 --> 01:31:33,542
Give me a second.

1152
01:31:34,875 --> 01:31:38,042
Mr Chen. Please follow me.

1153
01:31:38,458 --> 01:31:39,750
This way, please.

1154
01:31:39,750 --> 01:31:40,792
Hey.

1155
01:31:40,792 --> 01:31:41,583
Where is our rice?

1156
01:31:41,583 --> 01:31:42,917
Rice? Give me a second.

1157
01:31:42,917 --> 01:31:44,750
Your rice is coming right away.

1158
01:31:47,250 --> 01:31:49,167
Sorry to keep you waiting.

1159
01:31:49,167 --> 01:31:50,375
Thank you.

1160
01:31:50,375 --> 01:31:51,833
Enjoy your food.

1161
01:31:52,333 --> 01:31:54,042
Mr Chen. This way, please.

1162
01:31:54,667 --> 01:31:57,208
Hey! Haven't you gone to the bathroom just now?

1163
01:31:57,208 --> 01:32:01,000
Wait! Don't puke!

1164
01:32:01,542 --> 01:32:03,833
Are you all right?

1165
01:32:03,833 --> 01:32:06,875
I thought you went to the restroom.
Why are you here?

1166
01:32:07,417 --> 01:32:08,750
I'm sorry. This way, please.

1167
01:32:08,750 --> 01:32:10,083
We are super busy today.

1168
01:32:10,083 --> 01:32:11,292
- Hey!
- This way, please.

1169
01:32:11,292 --> 01:32:12,792
The rice is cold!

1170
01:32:13,083 --> 01:32:14,125
Give me a second.

1171
01:32:14,125 --> 01:32:15,792
- I'm sorry. The rice is cold?
- I want tea.

1172
01:32:15,792 --> 01:32:17,000
Give me a second. I'll give you another bowl.

1173
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:18,458
- Quick!
- Tell me the room number. I'll look for it myself.

1174
01:32:18,458 --> 01:32:20,708
- I want tea.
- Give me a second.

1175
01:32:20,708 --> 01:32:21,542
Sure I'll get you tea.

1176
01:32:21,542 --> 01:32:24,333
Give me a second. I'll be right back.

1177
01:32:29,375 --> 01:32:31,625
We should not forget you.

1178
01:32:31,625 --> 01:32:35,125
And we should watch with the closest interests

1179
01:32:35,125 --> 01:32:40,917
as you embark on this new era
of your remarkable history.
