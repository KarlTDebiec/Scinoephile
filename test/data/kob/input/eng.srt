1
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:17,971
Young master, we are ready

2
00:02:59,763 --> 00:03:00,472
What's a hard job for you,
young master

3
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:01,473
The towel, young master

4
00:03:10,815 --> 00:03:12,317
What did he write?

5
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,401
His name!

6
00:03:13,777 --> 00:03:17,489
Great! Young master knows how to
write his name!

7
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:18,615
Yes!

8
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:19,908
Damn!

9
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:26,122
Nice calligraphy

10
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:28,458
Get lost

11
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:34,964
Nice calligraphy!
So Cha Ha Yee Chan!

12
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:36,883
It's reversed, Master

13
00:03:37,258 --> 00:03:38,927
Chan Yee Ha Cha So

14
00:03:39,803 --> 00:03:42,639
Good boy, but, don't be proud!
Got me?

15
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:47,477
Dad, since the first
emperor of the Ching Dynasty,

16
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:49,312
our family

17
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:51,189
has been illiterate

18
00:03:51,272 --> 00:03:54,401
But not, my son,
that's your grandson,

19
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:56,403
he knows how to write his name!

20
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:59,572
Dad, it's very great!

21
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:01,533
He knows writing now,

22
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:03,493
he will be a scholar one day

23
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:04,828
Now, he knows how to write his name,

24
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:06,871
he will have a son later

25
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:09,749
Young master,
you should try hard to learn

26
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:12,085
Chan, I think,
we should mount it

27
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:12,836
OK

28
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:15,005
Professor, show it in
some obvious places

29
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,131
By the way, one minute,

30
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:18,967
why don't you carry it with traditional
decoration in the street?

31
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:19,634
What?

32
00:04:19,718 --> 00:04:20,552
Let's go!

33
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:22,971
Chan, come and sit…

34
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:26,099
I am so pleased that you are that hard
working and filial

35
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:30,145
Listen to me, I am notorious of being
a spendthrift

36
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:32,731
My fortune is almost used up

37
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:35,525
If I die one day,

38
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:37,444
you should depend on yourself

39
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:38,570
I used to depend on myself

40
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:41,865
The cheque is worth 100,000 taels!
Don't be an extravagant spender

41
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:44,576
Give me the imported hat

42
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:45,744
Where are you going?
Chan!

43
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:47,328
I am having a grand
birthday party tonight

44
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:49,456
How old are you?

45
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:51,624
25 years old. Come earlier

46
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,794
But you should dress up first

47
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:56,546
You are like beggar!

48
00:04:57,047 --> 00:04:59,132
How can a beggar be that rich?!
I do want to be a rich beggar!

49
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:03,636
That fat-headed…

50
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,721
Come over here

51
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:06,097
What's the matter?

52
00:05:06,598 --> 00:05:09,476
The invitation card
of my son is great!

53
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:12,103
If I hold a birthday party in future,
I want a better invitation card!

54
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:34,668
Your Majesty, how do you think about
the Cantonese Opera?

55
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:39,089
For sure, it can't compete
with Peking Opera!

56
00:05:39,631 --> 00:05:41,883
But, I am appreciated
to view this

57
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:46,763
Money…

58
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:50,392
Tips. Tips…

59
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:51,726
Happy birthday to you, Mr So

60
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:53,978
I am homeless and sick…

61
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:57,607
I am poor, I am damn poor!

62
00:05:57,982 --> 00:05:58,858
Please give me some money

63
00:05:58,942 --> 00:05:59,859
Kidding? Damn you beggar!

64
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:02,487
How can you beg here?

65
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:03,738
Go to hell!

66
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:04,614
Give him tips

67
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:05,824
Yes, young master

68
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:08,034
Are you kidding?
How can you give him tips?

69
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:10,578
A beggar is a man too

70
00:06:10,662 --> 00:06:12,122
Everyone can come here
if he has money

71
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:13,123
Your living,

72
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:15,500
including the expenditure for hooking,
I will pay for you!

73
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:16,418
You pay it?

74
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:17,419
So what?

75
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:20,505
Nothing!

76
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:21,965
Please follow me

77
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:25,176
Come into my room…

78
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:27,178
Mr So!

79
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:28,722
Hello…

80
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:29,723
How are you, Madam Pimp?

81
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:31,891
It's very bad of
you to call me that!

82
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:33,643
Just be frank, why not?

83
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:34,728
You should be frank!

84
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:37,522
Your hat, is like
the mourning uniform!

85
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:38,940
Is your dad passed away?

86
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:42,569
I feel happy to talk in this way

87
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:46,865
Mr Chiu, you helped me to terminate
the Hairy Gang,

88
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:49,075
the emperor will
give you award for this

89
00:06:49,868 --> 00:06:51,619
I'll appreciate it if you

90
00:06:51,703 --> 00:06:53,038
speak something nice in front of
the emperor

91
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:56,249
Please have the towel

92
00:07:00,462 --> 00:07:02,756
Mr So has come

93
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:04,758
Congratulation!

94
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:05,925
This way…

95
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:08,261
Mr So, today is your big day,
you must be very happy!

96
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:10,555
We have some new girls,
you must be satisfied with it

97
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:11,765
What are they?
Gold fish, or cooked fish?

98
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:13,725
What does that mean?

99
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:15,769
You idiot! Gold fish is
for watching only

100
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:17,145
Cooked fish can be eaten

101
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:19,606
Cooked fish of course

102
00:07:19,898 --> 00:07:21,775
You, cooked fishes, why don't you
come and serve Mr So?

103
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:24,903
Mr So, you are the
superior master today

104
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:26,905
What kind of woman do you want?
Just tell me

105
00:07:27,322 --> 00:07:29,407
I won't mind,
every women is just the same

106
00:07:29,491 --> 00:07:30,533
Nothing special

107
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:37,791
Mr So, what's the matter?

108
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:39,709
I am attacked

109
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:40,460
What? Who dared so?

110
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,170
I will hit that
bastard's mouth for you

111
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:43,171
She didn't use her mouth

112
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:44,339
She used her eyes

113
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:47,342
Tempting, and I smell blood
I haven't seen such eyesight before

114
00:07:48,093 --> 00:07:49,969
Who is she?

115
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:52,055
Miss Yushang comes to be part time
hooker only

116
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:54,224
Is Mr Chiu interested to sleep with her?

117
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:55,642
You should ask His Majesty first

118
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:57,060
How is it? Your Majesty?

119
00:07:57,686 --> 00:08:00,313
We are friends,
just go ahead if you want!

120
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:02,148
Mr Chiu, help yourself

121
00:08:03,108 --> 00:08:04,442
Thank you then

122
00:08:04,526 --> 00:08:05,485
The room service please

123
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,863
Yushang, come and greet Mr Chiu

124
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:12,867
Sister, he is the one we want

125
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:14,369
He killed dad

126
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:15,745
I know, stay calm

127
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:16,496
Let's go

128
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:17,497
May I be excused

129
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,249
Mr Chiu, Miss Yushang has arrived

130
00:08:22,127 --> 00:08:25,755
How are you? Mr Chiu

131
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:31,928
A pretty woman!

132
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:36,641
Mr Chiu, about tonight…

133
00:08:36,725 --> 00:08:37,851
$100,000

134
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:40,854
if Miss Yushang sleeps with our
young master tonight…

135
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:42,522
You are not welcomed

136
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:45,400
I am sorry, I am damn sorry

137
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:46,526
Don't you have any objection?

138
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:50,155
Let me say something fair

139
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:51,573
If any of you can offer

140
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:52,949
more than $100,000

141
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:54,701
Yushang will sleep with whom

142
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:56,411
Don't quarrel because of such
small amount,

143
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:58,038
isn't it right?

144
00:08:58,121 --> 00:08:59,789
Pal, you are a big spender

145
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:02,876
The cheque is too simple to me

146
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:08,465
I have a pearl which is granted by the
Royal family, it's invaluable!

147
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:13,678
I love the pearl more

148
00:09:15,597 --> 00:09:18,266
Mr Chiu, I will wait
you in my room

149
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,810
Does the pearl worth $100,000?

150
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:23,855
Don't you think that's
too little for you?

151
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:25,148
I love money too

152
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:27,400
But, I don't like you

153
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:33,573
You are frank!
I love it very much

154
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:34,616
Mr So…

155
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:35,533
It doesn't matter,

156
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:37,243
I think, my hat doesn't match me

157
00:09:37,369 --> 00:09:40,413
Yushang doesn't like me,
I deserve it

158
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:41,706
I am glad you understand this

159
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:42,665
Don't worry,

160
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:44,292
I have many pretty girls here

161
00:09:44,376 --> 00:09:47,253
I trust your arrangement

162
00:09:50,215 --> 00:09:51,716
None of my business

163
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,176
How bold are you?

164
00:10:02,811 --> 00:10:05,146
Mantis Fist?
It seems to be powerful

165
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:06,189
Music!

166
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:14,781
Keep this

167
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:16,616
See my Crane's Fists!

168
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:17,450
The Tiger's Claws!

169
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:25,375
How can a mantis fight with a tiger?

170
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:27,752
I know Tiger Claws
and Crane's Fists too!

171
00:10:29,421 --> 00:10:31,172
Well, try me mantis!

172
00:10:44,728 --> 00:10:46,604
Bravo…

173
00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:48,982
Your Tiger's claws are defeated

174
00:10:51,109 --> 00:10:52,277
Actually it's not Tiger's Claws,

175
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,820
it's beggar's fists!

176
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:55,321
That's why it's too weak

177
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:02,996
You move fast!

178
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:04,456
It seems to be powerful…

179
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:09,294
Kid, you don't know how
the wind blows

180
00:11:16,551 --> 00:11:17,969
The general of
Canton has arrived

181
00:11:18,053 --> 00:11:20,764
Get lost…

182
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:23,391
Who dares bully my son,
let me teach him a lesson

183
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:25,018
Master

184
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:26,561
Don't panic, Chan who bullied you?

185
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:27,562
It's me who bullied others

186
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:29,147
What? You bullied others?

187
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:31,358
How much does he have?
Is he qualified to be bullied by you?

188
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:32,817
Master, they are the ones

189
00:11:32,901 --> 00:11:33,360
Who are they?

190
00:11:33,443 --> 00:11:34,819
Just take a look

191
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,114
The King of Iron Hat?

192
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:42,035
Send the gift

193
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:42,744
Chan

194
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:44,371
They send you so valuable present,
you'd stop bullying them

195
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:45,997
Come on, give tips to the girls here

196
00:11:46,081 --> 00:11:46,790
Master

197
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:49,125
King of Iron Hat, Seng-ko-lin-ch'in
is written on the medal

198
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:01,304
How dare you seize the medal
of His Majesty?

199
00:12:01,805 --> 00:12:02,430
Cuff him

200
00:12:02,514 --> 00:12:04,766
Hold it, according to the Ching's law,

201
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:07,394
Courtier is to allowed hooking

202
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:08,895
Now, you are in the brothel

203
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:11,022
Do you know you have committed
the laws of Ching?

204
00:12:11,523 --> 00:12:12,440
How about you?

205
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:14,109
- You mean me?
-Yes!

206
00:12:14,192 --> 00:12:16,236
That's right, I come…

207
00:12:16,319 --> 00:12:17,112
- to arrest…
- You!

208
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,863
- Him!
- Arrest him!

209
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:20,407
I am the general of Canton,

210
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:22,909
so I should arrest
those bad people

211
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:24,035
By the way…

212
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:25,829
What else? Go ahead

213
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:29,374
Today is the birthday of
the Ex-Empress Dowager

214
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:31,626
So your crime is doubled

215
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:32,836
It may cause to capital punishment

216
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:35,422
Kill him…

217
00:12:39,718 --> 00:12:40,885
According to the Ching laws,

218
00:12:40,969 --> 00:12:43,138
anyone without a tail should be killed

219
00:12:43,221 --> 00:12:45,098
So you…

220
00:12:47,976 --> 00:12:49,019
Do you want to see my hair?

221
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:50,395
You can see as much as you want!
Fat-headed

222
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:52,856
Cut the crap, just kill him

223
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:54,858
OK, it's finished

224
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:57,569
General So, let's play happily together,
so forget it

225
00:12:57,652 --> 00:12:58,987
I haven't played!

226
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:00,655
Your Majesty,

227
00:13:00,739 --> 00:13:02,991
a rascal has ruined
the atmosphere here,

228
00:13:03,074 --> 00:13:03,908
I should be blamed
for poor arrangement

229
00:13:04,576 --> 00:13:05,410
None of your business

230
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:07,120
Let's go

231
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:12,625
Master, you can't fool this guy.
Let's go

232
00:13:13,668 --> 00:13:14,294
OK, go

233
00:13:15,545 --> 00:13:17,505
Just forget the trouble

234
00:13:20,383 --> 00:13:22,677
Young master, your hat

235
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:30,769
He is great!

236
00:13:39,861 --> 00:13:42,781
Uncle Mok, the dishes
are all poisoned

237
00:13:42,864 --> 00:13:46,868
Chiu assassinated our Master

238
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:48,953
and some generals of
The Taiping Reign

239
00:13:49,037 --> 00:13:50,538
And he framed us, the Beggars Association,
to be the assassinators

240
00:13:51,289 --> 00:13:52,916
Thus made us

241
00:13:53,124 --> 00:13:54,668
being despised by the world

242
00:13:55,585 --> 00:13:56,961
Saying that we became the dogs
of the government

243
00:13:57,504 --> 00:13:59,673
I should ask him to pay for it

244
00:14:01,424 --> 00:14:02,842
His initial power is harmful

245
00:14:02,926 --> 00:14:05,428
Don't take action
until he is trapped

246
00:14:05,512 --> 00:14:07,889
Because we can't defeat him even
we group together

247
00:14:08,223 --> 00:14:09,766
I will try my best to seduce
him to the bed

248
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:12,435
Senior, somebody is coming

249
00:14:13,228 --> 00:14:14,270
Get ready…

250
00:14:22,737 --> 00:14:24,197
Miss Yushang, we meet again

251
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,282
Why do you come here?
Where is Mister Chiu?

252
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:27,701
The pearl of Mr Chiu is broken

253
00:14:27,784 --> 00:14:29,744
by Mr So and become pearl powder

254
00:14:29,828 --> 00:14:31,121
I have drunk it

255
00:14:31,955 --> 00:14:33,832
Don't judge Mr So from his hair,

256
00:14:33,915 --> 00:14:36,209
he is really romantic and funny

257
00:14:36,626 --> 00:14:37,293
But…

258
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:39,713
Stop, I have taken his money,
100,000 taels you know?

259
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:41,381
I won't give it back

260
00:14:41,715 --> 00:14:43,550
About the personality of Mr So…

261
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:45,260
Cut the crap, pimp!

262
00:14:45,343 --> 00:14:46,177
Leave here first

263
00:14:46,261 --> 00:14:47,262
Yes, you are right

264
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:48,388
Miss Seven…

265
00:14:48,471 --> 00:14:49,931
Just accept this

266
00:14:54,728 --> 00:14:55,729
Who is this guy?

267
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:57,188
I don't know

268
00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:00,233
Miss, first of all, I have a good
news to you

269
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:02,152
I love you

270
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:05,113
To me, this is a bad news

271
00:15:05,697 --> 00:15:07,365
I know you will reply like this

272
00:15:07,949 --> 00:15:08,742
Cut the crap

273
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:09,993
I wish to pay you 100 pearls

274
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:12,996
for you your company tonight

275
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:14,205
I don't want to talk to you

276
00:15:14,289 --> 00:15:15,331
Please get out

277
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:18,335
I haven't chosen a wrong one

278
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:20,337
OK, I will drink this wine first

279
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:22,255
No…

280
00:15:28,553 --> 00:15:30,805
It surprised me

281
00:15:32,015 --> 00:15:32,599
Miss

282
00:15:32,682 --> 00:15:33,558
Hands off!

283
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:36,728
You know Kung-fu?

284
00:15:37,729 --> 00:15:39,439
No, I don't know Kung-fu at all

285
00:15:40,023 --> 00:15:41,941
I beg you, stop bothering me

286
00:15:42,025 --> 00:15:43,151
I won't accompany you

287
00:15:43,234 --> 00:15:45,779
Yushang, no one treats
me like this

288
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:48,323
I have found that
I am in love with you

289
00:15:50,075 --> 00:15:51,117
What?

290
00:15:51,618 --> 00:15:54,537
I have been in love with you

291
00:15:56,206 --> 00:15:57,332
Are you kidding?

292
00:15:57,707 --> 00:16:00,126
I am not kidding,
I decided to marry you

293
00:16:01,252 --> 00:16:02,337
Are you nuts?

294
00:16:04,047 --> 00:16:05,048
Kidding?

295
00:16:07,842 --> 00:16:09,302
Are there anyone hiding here?

296
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:14,766
That's good, I want a witness

297
00:16:14,849 --> 00:16:15,934
Witness?

298
00:16:16,017 --> 00:16:18,520
Yes, I swear in front of your sword

299
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:20,814
I do want to marry Miss Yushang
as my wife, I am sincere

300
00:16:20,897 --> 00:16:23,066
If I cheat,
I will be killed by thunder

301
00:16:24,359 --> 00:16:26,444
Sister, I feel excited for you

302
00:16:26,528 --> 00:16:27,487
Hey

303
00:16:29,072 --> 00:16:30,407
Don't you know it's that easy
to be my husband?

304
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:32,325
How can I be your husband?

305
00:16:34,119 --> 00:16:35,870
I want him to be the superior
Kung-fu master

306
00:16:35,954 --> 00:16:37,205
Be the top of all

307
00:16:37,288 --> 00:16:38,415
Can you do that?

308
00:16:39,374 --> 00:16:40,333
Let me think for one second

309
00:16:47,132 --> 00:16:48,049
I can do it

310
00:16:49,968 --> 00:16:50,885
OK

311
00:16:50,969 --> 00:16:53,471
Do it first and then look for me

312
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:57,267
Well, I think we should fix a date
for our wedding

313
00:16:57,684 --> 00:17:00,311
Because, this is too easy to me
to be the Kung-fu scholar!

314
00:17:01,271 --> 00:17:04,816
OK, but you'd give me some time
to consider it

315
00:17:04,899 --> 00:17:07,402
No problem, I will wait for your answer
outside the garden

316
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:09,571
I won't leave until seeing you

317
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,160
Crazy!

318
00:17:38,141 --> 00:17:40,769
We come for the Beggars Association,
those unrelated persons leave at once

319
00:18:37,826 --> 00:18:40,578
Sir, the timing is fit

320
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:42,956
The road is safe now, please go

321
00:18:43,915 --> 00:18:47,043
Good, very good

322
00:18:49,587 --> 00:18:50,463
Let's go!

323
00:19:03,018 --> 00:19:05,478
Shit, we are late

324
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:08,398
That Manchurian should be blamed

325
00:19:15,405 --> 00:19:17,240
Sister…

326
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:18,074
What's the matter?

327
00:19:18,199 --> 00:19:19,367
The idiot is still there

328
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:20,618
Let's kill him

329
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:23,163
Forget it,
he doesn't mean to bother us

330
00:19:23,246 --> 00:19:24,539
Let him go

331
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,386
Are you fond of him?

332
00:19:38,928 --> 00:19:39,971
What did you say?

333
00:19:40,055 --> 00:19:41,431
I won't fall in love with anybody

334
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:43,641
until Chiu is killed

335
00:19:43,725 --> 00:19:44,934
Especially him

336
00:19:45,727 --> 00:19:47,479
Chiu is good at Kung-fu

337
00:19:47,562 --> 00:19:50,899
Mok said, we can't defeat him unless
using the "Dragon Killing Palms"

338
00:19:51,983 --> 00:19:53,276
So, I can never marry!

339
00:19:53,818 --> 00:19:55,820
Let's go, if you want to marry

340
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:16,633
What evil are you?
How dare you scare me?

341
00:20:17,676 --> 00:20:20,470
Mr So, it's me!

342
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:23,515
You are the pimp?!

343
00:20:23,598 --> 00:20:24,933
Yes!

344
00:20:25,016 --> 00:20:26,643
You have flat figure,
where are your busts?

345
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:29,604
It's early in the morning,
they haven't woken up yet

346
00:20:30,146 --> 00:20:31,690
It's lucky of you
for not being killed

347
00:20:31,773 --> 00:20:33,483
Don't go around if you haven't
made up yet

348
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:34,651
I won't do it again

349
00:20:35,443 --> 00:20:39,280
Stop waiting for Miss Yushang,
she left

350
00:20:40,198 --> 00:20:41,074
What?

351
00:20:45,328 --> 00:20:46,788
Where is she going?

352
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:51,376
She… she is going to Peking

353
00:20:52,085 --> 00:20:53,086
Peking?

354
00:20:53,712 --> 00:20:58,341
Men should contribute to the country

355
00:20:58,425 --> 00:21:02,429
Where should I put my pig-tail?

356
00:21:02,512 --> 00:21:04,514
Swing and swing…

357
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:06,599
I pull it and play it…

358
00:21:06,683 --> 00:21:07,934
Dad!

359
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:10,353
I decided to join the examination for the
scholar of Martial Arts

360
00:21:10,687 --> 00:21:12,063
Chan

361
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:14,733
I have been longing for this word
for 25 years

362
00:21:14,816 --> 00:21:16,568
For the family of us, you should do that

363
00:21:16,651 --> 00:21:18,820
Don't misunderstand it,
I do it not for no one

364
00:21:18,903 --> 00:21:19,696
But for a woman

365
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:20,947
What a hero!

366
00:21:21,322 --> 00:21:23,491
For a girl, you want to be the scholar
of Martial Arts!

367
00:21:23,616 --> 00:21:24,576
Who is that girl?

368
00:21:24,659 --> 00:21:26,911
The hooker of Yee Hung Brothel,
Miss Yushang

369
00:21:26,995 --> 00:21:28,163
For a hooker?

370
00:21:29,706 --> 00:21:30,707
What's wrong with it?

371
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:34,127
You have different taste,
you are great!

372
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:35,420
I am admiring you!

373
00:21:35,503 --> 00:21:36,504
I will accompany you to Peking

374
00:21:36,588 --> 00:21:37,797
2, 3, 4, 5, 6

375
00:21:37,881 --> 00:21:40,175
I am coming

376
00:21:40,258 --> 00:21:42,677
Young master is going for the examination,
let's move to Peking too

377
00:21:45,055 --> 00:21:46,348
Stop chasing,

378
00:21:46,431 --> 00:21:48,683
we won't take the hens with us

379
00:21:48,767 --> 00:21:52,270
Be careful!

380
00:21:52,354 --> 00:21:54,773
If you break my stuff,
I will teach you good lesson

381
00:21:55,398 --> 00:21:56,358
Be careful!

382
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,151
Good morning dad

383
00:21:58,234 --> 00:21:58,818
Good morning

384
00:21:58,902 --> 00:21:59,778
You want to move
everything to Peking?

385
00:21:59,861 --> 00:22:00,612
Sure

386
00:22:00,695 --> 00:22:02,364
Please leave me a clothe

387
00:22:02,447 --> 00:22:04,157
You are only a kid,
you don't need this

388
00:22:04,574 --> 00:22:05,533
But I am no small

389
00:22:07,118 --> 00:22:09,454
Are you bigger than mine?

390
00:22:09,746 --> 00:22:10,538
You despise me!

391
00:22:10,622 --> 00:22:11,623
Mine will be bigger
than yours one day

392
00:22:11,706 --> 00:22:14,584
Let's find something,
say trousers to cover it

393
00:22:15,043 --> 00:22:15,877
I don't want to see it

394
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,713
Why are you standing here for?
Why don't you remove it?

395
00:22:20,131 --> 00:22:21,758
It's a hard job to remove
such a big house!

396
00:22:21,841 --> 00:22:23,635
Please, work hard men!

397
00:22:23,718 --> 00:22:27,514
Ready, 1, 2, 3, push!

398
00:22:27,889 --> 00:22:31,476
Push!

399
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:32,686
Be careful!

400
00:22:33,061 --> 00:22:34,646
Tie it well…

401
00:22:34,688 --> 00:22:35,980
Master, do you want to
move the tree too?

402
00:22:36,064 --> 00:22:37,107
Sure,

403
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:39,192
or how can I eat Lychee in Peking?

404
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:41,277
Push it over…

405
00:22:42,445 --> 00:22:45,532
Be careful

406
00:22:45,615 --> 00:22:48,243
Take care of my Lychee,
you fat headed!

407
00:22:49,327 --> 00:22:51,454
Chiu helped me to terminate

408
00:22:51,538 --> 00:22:55,875
the Hairy Gang in Kwangsi

409
00:22:55,959 --> 00:22:58,753
So I bring him here
to greet Your Majesty

410
00:22:59,921 --> 00:23:04,551
Fine, I am now appointing you to be
the Deputy Secretary

411
00:23:05,969 --> 00:23:08,972
Hope you will serve our Ching Dynasty
whole-heartedly

412
00:23:09,597 --> 00:23:10,682
Thank you, Your Majesty

413
00:23:10,932 --> 00:23:14,019
Your Majesty, Mr Chiu is a magician

414
00:23:14,477 --> 00:23:17,397
Why don't you ask him to
show you something?

415
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,690
Magic?

416
00:23:21,026 --> 00:23:23,737
Mr Chiu, then show me your magic

417
00:23:23,862 --> 00:23:25,155
Yes, Your Majesty

418
00:25:40,999 --> 00:25:42,125
There is nothing surprising, go

419
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:43,209
Yes

420
00:25:56,765 --> 00:25:59,684
I am sorry for scaring you

421
00:26:00,143 --> 00:26:02,354
If this girl is real,
that's fantastic!

422
00:26:04,397 --> 00:26:05,732
Hurry up!

423
00:26:06,149 --> 00:26:08,693
What's the matter?

424
00:26:08,777 --> 00:26:11,780
Come on, go in

425
00:26:12,739 --> 00:26:13,740
What's the matter?

426
00:26:13,823 --> 00:26:16,951
Hide in

427
00:26:19,037 --> 00:26:19,871
Get ready, young master

428
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:21,915
Come on

429
00:26:22,916 --> 00:26:24,417
Freeze, don't move

430
00:26:29,506 --> 00:26:32,550
Sweet smell, are you Piu Hung?

431
00:26:32,634 --> 00:26:34,928
You are great!
I love it

432
00:26:35,929 --> 00:26:37,097
Closer

433
00:26:38,098 --> 00:26:40,350
So big!
You must be Small!

434
00:26:40,767 --> 00:26:43,561
You are bad, how can
you say so to me?

435
00:26:43,645 --> 00:26:44,521
You are big!

436
00:26:47,107 --> 00:26:49,609
What? Pregnant woman?
You can't cheat me

437
00:26:49,693 --> 00:26:50,610
You are dad

438
00:26:50,694 --> 00:26:53,905
How bad are you,
how can you guess that?

439
00:26:53,988 --> 00:26:55,323
Good boy

440
00:26:55,407 --> 00:26:59,536
I wanted to trick you actually,
you are really smart

441
00:27:00,745 --> 00:27:03,289
Young master has to join
the examination tomorrow,

442
00:27:03,373 --> 00:27:04,165
stop playing

443
00:27:04,249 --> 00:27:05,417
Get out…

444
00:27:06,584 --> 00:27:08,586
Chan, have you prepared

445
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:09,921
for your examination?

446
00:27:10,005 --> 00:27:12,549
What should I prepare?
I must win, don't you know that?

447
00:27:12,674 --> 00:27:13,758
Yes I do!

448
00:27:14,843 --> 00:27:17,137
I have faith in you from seeing
your behaviour!

449
00:27:17,804 --> 00:27:19,764
Chan, this is Uncle Cheng

450
00:27:19,848 --> 00:27:21,141
He will be the examiner

451
00:27:21,224 --> 00:27:22,392
Say hello to Uncle Cheng

452
00:27:23,143 --> 00:27:25,437
How are you, Uncle Cheng?

453
00:27:28,356 --> 00:27:29,816
See

454
00:27:29,899 --> 00:27:32,152
Doesn't he seem to be the winner?

455
00:27:33,319 --> 00:27:34,320
It depends on the fate

456
00:27:35,405 --> 00:27:37,407
Cheng, I've asked someone

457
00:27:37,782 --> 00:27:39,117
to finish the papers
which you gave me

458
00:27:39,492 --> 00:27:40,326
Will the questions be changed?

459
00:27:41,036 --> 00:27:42,704
Don't worry about
the question paper

460
00:27:42,996 --> 00:27:44,247
But about the test
of arrows shooting,

461
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:45,957
riding, boxing and weapons…

462
00:27:46,041 --> 00:27:47,417
He should try his best

463
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:48,460
Don't worry

464
00:27:48,543 --> 00:27:50,754
My son is keen in martial arts

465
00:27:50,837 --> 00:27:54,174
So, can I deduct some from the payment
of 2 million taels?

466
00:27:54,257 --> 00:27:56,718
We are friends,
but that is business

467
00:28:04,225 --> 00:28:08,229
Let the Horse teams
be the pioneer

468
00:28:08,313 --> 00:28:10,815
The arrows teams go side ways,
the gunmen stay back

469
00:28:42,347 --> 00:28:47,227
The candidates come in

470
00:29:42,115 --> 00:29:43,074
I can't lift it

471
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:46,828
I don't want to waste my force

472
00:29:46,911 --> 00:29:49,372
Shameless? Damn you!

473
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:18,651
Oh, 10 marks

474
00:31:43,528 --> 00:31:46,114
The final race now starts

475
00:31:47,365 --> 00:31:48,491
The candidates,

476
00:31:48,575 --> 00:31:50,744
Po Ye Tat Tor from Mongolia

477
00:31:51,202 --> 00:31:54,873
Bravo…

478
00:31:54,956 --> 00:31:57,334
And So Cha Ha Yee
Chan from Canton

479
00:32:00,754 --> 00:32:01,796
Last call

480
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:04,883
So, one to ten.
Po, one to one

481
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:09,054
Are you kidding, how can the betting rates
differ so much?

482
00:32:09,471 --> 00:32:11,723
One to ten for Chan? Kidding?

483
00:32:12,182 --> 00:32:13,767
Why don't you have
faith in Chan?

484
00:32:13,892 --> 00:32:18,229
That is, Chan defaulted
in weight lifting

485
00:32:18,313 --> 00:32:21,566
Look, Po entered the final race

486
00:32:21,649 --> 00:32:24,361
with full marks, it differs

487
00:32:24,527 --> 00:32:27,614
It's an examination of the Scholar
of Martial Arts, not king of coolie

488
00:32:28,114 --> 00:32:29,657
It's meaningless to be the champion
of weight lifting

489
00:32:29,741 --> 00:32:31,201
You shouldn't put it that way

490
00:32:31,284 --> 00:32:32,327
What?

491
00:32:32,410 --> 00:32:33,745
He is smart

492
00:32:33,828 --> 00:32:36,039
I've studied this
race for a long time

493
00:32:36,122 --> 00:32:37,749
I feel strange about the rate too

494
00:32:37,832 --> 00:32:41,670
Po is smart and strong

495
00:32:41,753 --> 00:32:44,422
But see the sweat of his neck

496
00:32:44,506 --> 00:32:46,925
I think it's because
he is getting tired

497
00:32:47,008 --> 00:32:47,717
Really?

498
00:32:48,718 --> 00:32:50,011
But this So

499
00:32:50,095 --> 00:32:51,012
What do you thing?

500
00:32:51,096 --> 00:32:52,347
He has been disappointing
the audience

501
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:55,308
But he has achieved very hard

502
00:32:55,433 --> 00:32:56,851
What?

503
00:32:56,935 --> 00:33:00,397
He tried very hard

504
00:33:00,522 --> 00:33:03,316
So I want to bet on him

505
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,193
How much do you want to bet?

506
00:33:05,735 --> 00:33:07,028
800,000 taels

507
00:33:07,112 --> 00:33:09,656
Why not 2 million taels?

508
00:33:09,739 --> 00:33:12,033
What? Why are you so optimistic
about Chan?

509
00:33:12,117 --> 00:33:13,660
You have good analyse

510
00:33:13,743 --> 00:33:14,411
I feel Chan

511
00:33:14,494 --> 00:33:16,496
will be the champion

512
00:33:17,455 --> 00:33:19,082
Come on

513
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:21,167
I want to bet more on him

514
00:33:21,251 --> 00:33:21,918
Really?

515
00:33:22,043 --> 00:33:22,836
2 million taels!

516
00:33:23,795 --> 00:33:24,921
How generous!

517
00:33:25,714 --> 00:33:27,215
Why don't you bet?

518
00:33:27,507 --> 00:33:29,718
Why should I bet?
He is my son

519
00:33:31,261 --> 00:33:34,264
Shit, I miss one thing out
of my calculation

520
00:33:34,681 --> 00:33:35,515
What?

521
00:33:35,598 --> 00:33:36,558
The blood

522
00:33:38,727 --> 00:33:40,687
Here comes the Examiner

523
00:33:43,857 --> 00:33:44,858
What? Isn't Cheng the examiner?

524
00:33:49,362 --> 00:33:50,363
Please take a seat

525
00:33:53,158 --> 00:33:54,200
Seng-ko-lin-ch'in?!

526
00:33:54,701 --> 00:33:55,535
What's the problem?

527
00:33:56,870 --> 00:33:59,289
He is the uncle of Po

528
00:34:01,499 --> 00:34:02,751
Let's start

529
00:34:07,255 --> 00:34:08,506
Start!

530
00:34:39,037 --> 00:34:41,122
Bravo…

531
00:34:41,498 --> 00:34:44,417
They should act 2 more marks for that
powerful shoot

532
00:34:44,501 --> 00:34:46,252
I do think so

533
00:34:49,506 --> 00:34:53,009
So's arrow isn't on the target,
Po won this section

534
00:34:59,766 --> 00:35:02,310
Kidding? Damn you!
They are cheating

535
00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:08,900
The candidates please
get on the horses

536
00:35:11,986 --> 00:35:12,946
Mr Chiu

537
00:35:17,033 --> 00:35:19,661
Take these with you, may be you will
find them useful

538
00:35:20,328 --> 00:35:22,831
Here comes the 2nd round

539
00:35:53,236 --> 00:35:54,571
They trick again

540
00:35:55,488 --> 00:35:58,450
It's corrupt!
May I give up the betting?

541
00:36:22,974 --> 00:36:24,351
Chan won this race

542
00:36:24,851 --> 00:36:25,894
Did you tear the ticket?

543
00:36:25,977 --> 00:36:27,270
Not yet

544
00:36:40,533 --> 00:36:41,910
Are you kidding?

545
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,056
Once again?!

546
00:37:51,146 --> 00:37:52,939
OK, let's start from the very beginning,
I'll fight with single hand and leg

547
00:37:53,064 --> 00:37:54,441
I won't take your advantage

548
00:38:05,618 --> 00:38:07,328
How can you use
such dirty stance?

549
00:38:07,412 --> 00:38:09,039
Have you waken?

550
00:38:09,831 --> 00:38:11,416
Bravo! He won

551
00:38:11,499 --> 00:38:13,418
Have some tea

552
00:38:13,501 --> 00:38:14,711
All the best!

553
00:38:15,211 --> 00:38:16,755
What did

554
00:38:16,838 --> 00:38:17,589
you say?

555
00:38:17,672 --> 00:38:19,466
It's English

556
00:38:19,549 --> 00:38:20,550
It's English

557
00:38:21,092 --> 00:38:22,552
There is no regulation stating that
weapon is not allowed

558
00:38:22,969 --> 00:38:26,264
You fell down first,
Po is the winner again

559
00:38:30,185 --> 00:38:31,394
Damn you Cheng!

560
00:38:31,561 --> 00:38:33,396
You betrayed me!

561
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,856
I will beat you to death

562
00:38:34,939 --> 00:38:35,940
if I see you again

563
00:38:36,608 --> 00:38:38,109
Forget it, you won't
see him anymore

564
00:38:38,193 --> 00:38:38,943
Why?

565
00:38:39,027 --> 00:38:39,903
I am now going to kill him!

566
00:38:39,986 --> 00:38:40,862
I don't have 2 million to lose!

567
00:38:42,947 --> 00:38:43,990
Just kidding

568
00:38:44,407 --> 00:38:45,492
You shameless

569
00:38:45,742 --> 00:38:50,121
Po is the Scholar of Martial Arts

570
00:38:50,663 --> 00:38:52,791
I did win! Objection

571
00:39:10,892 --> 00:39:11,935
What are you doing?

572
00:39:12,018 --> 00:39:15,605
The dart is poisoned

573
00:39:17,524 --> 00:39:19,401
He deserves it!

574
00:39:22,862 --> 00:39:24,614
He was poisoned by his own dart

575
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:27,826
Well, my son will
be the Scholar then

576
00:39:27,951 --> 00:39:28,868
I am going to be rich!

577
00:39:28,993 --> 00:39:30,203
Yes!

578
00:39:39,254 --> 00:39:41,381
Thank you, my ancestors!

579
00:39:41,464 --> 00:39:42,632
You have good judgement

580
00:39:45,468 --> 00:39:47,470
Sir, His Majesty wants to appoint
the title himself

581
00:39:55,437 --> 00:39:59,399
I want to take some statement
from you as record

582
00:39:59,524 --> 00:40:02,110
You won this time, who are you
going to thank?

583
00:40:02,193 --> 00:40:03,361
Miss Yushang!

584
00:40:04,654 --> 00:40:07,532
Is Miss Yushang your mom?

585
00:40:12,245 --> 00:40:14,748
Long life to you!

586
00:40:15,331 --> 00:40:15,999
Please get up

587
00:40:16,082 --> 00:40:17,125
Thank you

588
00:40:19,044 --> 00:40:21,755
Who is the new Scholar
of Martial Arts?

589
00:40:24,007 --> 00:40:27,052
Your Majesty, So Chan from Canton
is the Scholar this year

590
00:40:30,347 --> 00:40:32,515
Your Majesty,
I am So Cha Ha Yee Chan

591
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:36,728
Your Majesty,
I want to report something

592
00:40:39,647 --> 00:40:40,398
Go ahead

593
00:40:42,192 --> 00:40:44,194
I have found that
So is illiterate

594
00:40:44,652 --> 00:40:46,279
So how could he answer the
question paper of strategy?

595
00:40:46,363 --> 00:40:47,364
That should be tricks

596
00:40:52,077 --> 00:40:53,203
Take the stationery out!

597
00:40:53,286 --> 00:40:54,287
Yes

598
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:02,545
So Cha Ha Yee Chan,
write your name now

599
00:41:04,631 --> 00:41:07,008
Thank God, he knows how to
write his name!

600
00:41:07,092 --> 00:41:08,760
He can write his name!

601
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:22,982
I don't know how to write

602
00:41:24,984 --> 00:41:26,111
That's shit!

603
00:41:27,112 --> 00:41:28,071
Kill him now

604
00:41:28,655 --> 00:41:29,823
No! No!

605
00:41:32,033 --> 00:41:33,368
Your Majesty,
I am the one who cheated

606
00:41:33,451 --> 00:41:34,327
It's none of his business

607
00:41:34,411 --> 00:41:35,370
Just chop me to death

608
00:41:35,453 --> 00:41:36,663
No, you should kill me

609
00:41:36,830 --> 00:41:37,497
Sorry dad

610
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:38,665
I don't know how to write my name

611
00:41:38,748 --> 00:41:39,833
Stop, I have known it already

612
00:41:39,958 --> 00:41:41,418
Your Majesty, I should be killed

613
00:41:41,543 --> 00:41:42,127
Kill me

614
00:41:42,210 --> 00:41:43,003
No, kill me

615
00:41:43,086 --> 00:41:43,795
Kill me

616
00:41:43,878 --> 00:41:44,587
Your Majesty, you'd better kill me

617
00:41:44,671 --> 00:41:46,798
Shit, are you giving order?

618
00:41:47,382 --> 00:41:48,633
You two co-operated to cheat me

619
00:41:49,342 --> 00:41:51,052
The Secretary for Justice,
announce the penalty for them

620
00:41:52,012 --> 00:41:55,306
Come out! Hurry up

621
00:41:55,932 --> 00:41:57,851
I am here!

622
00:42:01,938 --> 00:42:02,939
He is the Secretary for Justice

623
00:42:03,606 --> 00:42:05,942
So's family should be

624
00:42:06,026 --> 00:42:07,402
sentenced to death

625
00:42:09,362 --> 00:42:11,948
But their ancestors achieved a lot
to Ching, they can be exampled

626
00:42:12,032 --> 00:42:15,160
But, their fortune should be forfeited

627
00:42:15,952 --> 00:42:16,995
Have you carried out any military duty?

628
00:42:17,579 --> 00:42:19,706
I haven't gone back to my camp for
7 years, I haven't done anything

629
00:42:21,166 --> 00:42:23,668
So, he didn't miscarry out any duty

630
00:42:25,295 --> 00:42:25,795
So, the maximum penalty

631
00:42:25,879 --> 00:42:28,590
is forfeiture of property only

632
00:42:32,385 --> 00:42:34,137
What? Are you sure?

633
00:42:34,888 --> 00:42:36,514
I am fair

634
00:42:36,639 --> 00:42:38,975
I judge it from the Law Book

635
00:42:40,602 --> 00:42:42,062
Can I add something?

636
00:42:42,937 --> 00:42:45,607
Sure, since you are the Emperor

637
00:42:46,024 --> 00:42:48,735
I want them to be beggars for the rest
of their lives

638
00:42:49,277 --> 00:42:51,446
Why couldn't you find out they cheated
during the examination?

639
00:42:51,988 --> 00:42:53,198
Luckily Chiu reported
it to me on time

640
00:42:53,281 --> 00:42:56,201
Chiu, you would be rewarded

641
00:42:58,870 --> 00:43:02,665
I am wandering…

642
00:43:02,749 --> 00:43:05,043
That's the spirit tablet of my dad,
do you want to take it too?

643
00:43:07,128 --> 00:43:09,047
It's useless for you

644
00:43:09,130 --> 00:43:19,391
How poor are we…

645
00:43:19,474 --> 00:43:25,855
I am thinking of my better half…

646
00:43:25,939 --> 00:43:26,940
Young master,

647
00:43:27,691 --> 00:43:28,817
from now on,

648
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:30,902
you'd be hard working to learn
how to write

649
00:43:34,948 --> 00:43:41,788
But I can't sell the affection…

650
00:43:45,250 --> 00:43:46,167
Professor

651
00:43:47,711 --> 00:43:48,712
I will learn it

652
00:43:49,796 --> 00:43:54,426
I regret that…

653
00:43:54,968 --> 00:43:57,637
Master, I will take good care of
little turtle

654
00:43:57,804 --> 00:43:59,055
I am sorry

655
00:43:59,139 --> 00:44:01,725
We haven't given birth to any
baby of yours

656
00:44:01,808 --> 00:44:03,059
It doesn't matter

657
00:44:03,143 --> 00:44:05,145
It's all my fault

658
00:44:05,311 --> 00:44:06,104
If I did better,

659
00:44:06,187 --> 00:44:08,106
you could have many babies

660
00:44:08,189 --> 00:44:08,898
But I think

661
00:44:09,024 --> 00:44:10,942
Chan is enough for me

662
00:44:12,193 --> 00:44:13,361
Why are you standing here?
Go now

663
00:44:13,486 --> 00:44:15,030
Master, we are leaving

664
00:44:15,113 --> 00:44:16,156
We are leaving, master

665
00:44:16,239 --> 00:44:17,449
Go, go now

666
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:21,161
We are free

667
00:44:21,745 --> 00:44:23,705
I feel so happy

668
00:44:25,915 --> 00:44:27,792
How happy are we!

669
00:44:28,376 --> 00:44:29,627
Go in…

670
00:44:29,711 --> 00:44:30,920
Hurry up…

671
00:44:31,004 --> 00:44:32,172
How is it?

672
00:44:33,173 --> 00:44:34,716
Why are they so happy?

673
00:44:34,799 --> 00:44:35,967
What happened?

674
00:44:36,009 --> 00:44:37,886
I am very happy

675
00:44:38,428 --> 00:44:39,929
Please go in…

676
00:44:40,013 --> 00:44:41,014
Welcome…

677
00:44:41,973 --> 00:44:45,143
Damn sequestration,
I wanna cry, my son

678
00:44:45,226 --> 00:44:47,354
Hold it, don't lose our face

679
00:44:47,437 --> 00:44:48,438
Keep on laughing

680
00:44:50,106 --> 00:44:52,275
Son

681
00:44:52,359 --> 00:44:53,651
Have you kept any money?

682
00:44:53,735 --> 00:44:54,944
No, how about you?

683
00:44:55,028 --> 00:44:56,446
I forgot that

684
00:44:59,074 --> 00:45:02,494
Shit, damn sequestration!

685
00:45:04,788 --> 00:45:08,458
Be merciful,

686
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,460
please give money to us

687
00:45:10,543 --> 00:45:12,295
Son, that guy is like dad

688
00:45:13,004 --> 00:45:14,047
You mean the one who sings?

689
00:45:14,464 --> 00:45:16,341
No, the one who pays

690
00:45:16,424 --> 00:45:18,885
He is more disgusting
than the one who sings

691
00:45:18,968 --> 00:45:21,554
Not exactly, he is smart

692
00:45:23,056 --> 00:45:24,140
Dad should be blamed

693
00:45:24,224 --> 00:45:25,975
I always called you beggar

694
00:45:26,309 --> 00:45:27,435
Now, it becomes true

695
00:45:27,519 --> 00:45:28,478
What's wrong with you?

696
00:45:28,561 --> 00:45:29,813
The emperor wants
us to be beggars

697
00:45:29,938 --> 00:45:31,272
Do you think we'd be beggars?

698
00:45:31,356 --> 00:45:33,400
I am smart, I am keen
in kung-fu fighting

699
00:45:33,483 --> 00:45:35,276
Even the Gods won't
let me be beggars

700
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:36,319
That's true

701
00:45:36,403 --> 00:45:37,237
Am I like beggar?

702
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:38,321
No

703
00:45:39,072 --> 00:45:40,949
Buy something to eat, you beggars

704
00:45:43,076 --> 00:45:45,120
You treat us as beggars?

705
00:45:45,203 --> 00:45:46,996
Damn you!

706
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:49,499
It's weird! Let's eat

707
00:45:53,003 --> 00:45:54,963
Chan, since we have
nothing to do

708
00:45:55,046 --> 00:45:56,381
Let me take a seat,

709
00:45:56,506 --> 00:45:57,924
may be we can have something
to eat tonight

710
00:45:58,008 --> 00:45:59,384
You are treating
yourself a beggar?

711
00:45:59,968 --> 00:46:01,052
Dad, don't worry

712
00:46:01,094 --> 00:46:02,846
I need no begging for money

713
00:46:02,929 --> 00:46:04,097
How can you get money
if you don't beg?

714
00:46:04,180 --> 00:46:05,098
Just ask someone
to give us money

715
00:46:05,265 --> 00:46:06,808
Pal, may I know your name?

716
00:46:08,018 --> 00:46:08,852
Nau Tai Chung

717
00:46:08,935 --> 00:46:10,061
Do you have money?

718
00:46:10,145 --> 00:46:10,895
Yes

719
00:46:10,979 --> 00:46:11,855
Just give it to me

720
00:46:11,938 --> 00:46:12,647
OK

721
00:46:17,277 --> 00:46:18,069
Thank you

722
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:20,113
Why should I give you money?

723
00:46:20,822 --> 00:46:21,865
Why do you ask so many questions?

724
00:46:21,948 --> 00:46:23,283
But I should know the reason

725
00:46:23,366 --> 00:46:25,410
Anyway, you should pay it

726
00:46:25,493 --> 00:46:27,537
No, let's fix it up first

727
00:46:29,998 --> 00:46:31,374
Just give it to us, why are you
asking so much?

728
00:46:31,458 --> 00:46:32,167
Hands off

729
00:46:32,250 --> 00:46:33,084
You mean robbing?

730
00:46:33,126 --> 00:46:34,586
Robbery…

731
00:46:35,754 --> 00:46:37,464
I am not robbing, I am begging

732
00:46:37,547 --> 00:46:41,384
Begging? How dare are you, you beggar,
you are cheating me!

733
00:46:41,468 --> 00:46:44,554
Don't you think I am stupid?
I am smart, you know?

734
00:46:44,637 --> 00:46:45,680
Hey, two days passed,

735
00:46:45,764 --> 00:46:47,640
It's cold and I am hungry now

736
00:46:47,724 --> 00:46:49,476
Have you had any idea?

737
00:46:49,851 --> 00:46:50,727
I have a friend's girl-friend

738
00:46:51,144 --> 00:46:53,646
who is living in Peking

739
00:46:54,939 --> 00:46:56,858
She always admires you

740
00:46:56,941 --> 00:46:58,109
Really?

741
00:46:58,151 --> 00:47:01,112
Yes, if you are
willing to date her

742
00:47:01,154 --> 00:47:03,698
I think she will help us to
go back to Canton

743
00:47:03,782 --> 00:47:06,242
But, you have to sacrifice

744
00:47:06,326 --> 00:47:07,494
Do you mean…

745
00:47:07,577 --> 00:47:10,038
For our family,
just as you said

746
00:47:10,121 --> 00:47:11,873
I know it's very hard for you

747
00:47:11,956 --> 00:47:13,083
Cut the crap,
let's go and find her

748
00:47:13,166 --> 00:47:14,167
I have arranged it

749
00:47:14,793 --> 00:47:17,253
The one wearing red dress who stands
under the lantern, that's her

750
00:47:23,593 --> 00:47:24,594
Ghost!

751
00:47:30,058 --> 00:47:30,892
It's a benefit of you!

752
00:47:30,975 --> 00:47:33,103
Why don't you go yourself?

753
00:47:47,325 --> 00:47:49,244
Chan, I haven't tried this before

754
00:47:49,327 --> 00:47:50,161
Be careful!

755
00:47:50,245 --> 00:47:51,538
Don't worry

756
00:47:51,621 --> 00:47:52,455
I'll take care of you

757
00:47:52,539 --> 00:47:54,207
You want to earn money for
shark-fins, right?

758
00:47:54,290 --> 00:47:55,166
Right…

759
00:47:57,210 --> 00:48:00,171
Get lost…

760
00:48:00,296 --> 00:48:01,506
No show here

761
00:48:05,218 --> 00:48:07,137
We just want to earn some money

762
00:48:07,220 --> 00:48:08,221
to go back to Canton

763
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:11,182
Don't be that mean to us

764
00:48:13,351 --> 00:48:14,310
It's the Royal instruction that,

765
00:48:14,644 --> 00:48:17,022
the So's family'd
be beggars for life

766
00:48:17,147 --> 00:48:19,190
You two can only be beggars

767
00:48:19,691 --> 00:48:21,901
I am carrying my duty only.
Men!

768
00:48:22,027 --> 00:48:22,652
Yes!

769
00:48:22,736 --> 00:48:23,528
Remove all the things

770
00:48:23,611 --> 00:48:24,612
Yes

771
00:48:27,490 --> 00:48:28,783
Help!

772
00:48:28,825 --> 00:48:30,744
Master Chiu, it's hard
for one to carry it

773
00:48:30,827 --> 00:48:33,496
Ask more men to remove it

774
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:34,622
Yes

775
00:48:37,167 --> 00:48:38,001
What do you want?

776
00:48:38,084 --> 00:48:39,044
No, we can't move it

777
00:48:39,127 --> 00:48:39,794
Let me do it

778
00:48:39,878 --> 00:48:40,754
You want a fight, don't you?

779
00:48:42,088 --> 00:48:43,590
Last time you can escape from
Yee Hung Hostel

780
00:48:44,007 --> 00:48:45,425
But you won't be
that lucky this time

781
00:48:49,971 --> 00:48:50,889
He is powerful!

782
00:48:50,972 --> 00:48:51,931
I've to defeat him

783
00:48:52,015 --> 00:48:53,433
by one powerful strike

784
00:48:53,516 --> 00:48:55,477
I can't give him another chance
to counter attack

785
00:49:16,623 --> 00:49:20,085
Chan…

786
00:49:20,168 --> 00:49:22,337
Chan…

787
00:49:22,420 --> 00:49:24,255
Your legs and hands

788
00:49:24,381 --> 00:49:25,507
are all broken by me

789
00:49:26,675 --> 00:49:28,259
You will be cripple for the
rest of your life

790
00:49:30,428 --> 00:49:32,722
You want to fight? Not now!

791
00:49:33,556 --> 00:49:36,518
But, you can beg for money

792
00:49:37,268 --> 00:49:38,395
Be a good beggar

793
00:49:40,271 --> 00:49:44,150
Go, go away…

794
00:49:52,534 --> 00:49:56,246
Don't panic, Chan, it's OK

795
00:49:57,539 --> 00:50:03,670
Don't panic, you'll be
alright… Chan!

796
00:50:05,296 --> 00:50:08,341
I went to the examination hall

797
00:50:08,508 --> 00:50:10,218
with my son,

798
00:50:10,301 --> 00:50:12,303
don't you know who
was the examiner?

799
00:50:12,345 --> 00:50:15,140
He is Seng-ko-lin-ch'in,
that bastard

800
00:50:15,223 --> 00:50:18,309
He was the enemy of us!

801
00:50:18,643 --> 00:50:20,145
About our story…

802
00:50:20,228 --> 00:50:21,730
Let me stop here first,
I want a smoke

803
00:50:23,356 --> 00:50:25,191
It's better to smoke now

804
00:50:25,275 --> 00:50:27,068
Yes, it's better

805
00:50:27,152 --> 00:50:30,488
We let him go in

806
00:50:30,572 --> 00:50:32,490
the Yee Hung Brothel

807
00:50:32,574 --> 00:50:34,492
But he framed us in return

808
00:50:34,576 --> 00:50:36,661
He tricked my son

809
00:50:36,745 --> 00:50:39,039
during the examination

810
00:50:39,122 --> 00:50:42,334
But, my son was really
smart and great

811
00:50:42,375 --> 00:50:44,461
He finally won the race

812
00:50:44,544 --> 00:50:45,462
To be the greatest Kung-fu
fighter, invincible

813
00:50:45,545 --> 00:50:47,422
Be the top

814
00:50:47,505 --> 00:50:49,299
Can you do that?

815
00:50:49,382 --> 00:50:50,342
Sure!

816
00:50:50,383 --> 00:50:51,384
Well

817
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:54,220
Come back to me
if you can do that

818
00:50:55,889 --> 00:50:57,724
I think we should fix our
wedding date first

819
00:50:57,807 --> 00:51:00,727
Because being the scholar is
too simple to me

820
00:51:10,528 --> 00:51:11,613
Write your name at once

821
00:51:14,783 --> 00:51:15,533
I don't know how to write

822
00:51:26,252 --> 00:51:28,797
Chan, what's wrong with you?

823
00:51:32,175 --> 00:51:33,259
Nightmare again?

824
00:51:34,886 --> 00:51:35,970
Don't think so much!

825
00:51:43,186 --> 00:51:44,104
Although you have taken

826
00:51:44,312 --> 00:51:45,897
2 months' rest,

827
00:51:46,731 --> 00:51:48,149
your legs and hands have not been
totally recovered

828
00:51:49,609 --> 00:51:50,777
Coming

829
00:51:51,152 --> 00:51:53,822
I am going to beg for food

830
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:55,615
I will make the last herbal tea

831
00:51:55,699 --> 00:51:56,741
for you later

832
00:51:57,367 --> 00:51:59,160
Dad, you go begging again?

833
00:51:59,661 --> 00:52:01,705
This job should leave to me

834
00:52:01,788 --> 00:52:03,331
You are the Scholar…

835
00:52:06,584 --> 00:52:09,879
Chan, to be a beggar,

836
00:52:09,963 --> 00:52:11,715
there is some lessons!

837
00:52:12,257 --> 00:52:14,759
You can't just show your hand
and beg for money

838
00:52:14,843 --> 00:52:17,679
At least you should have a bowl,
that represents your class

839
00:52:17,762 --> 00:52:20,265
Is it ridiculous?

840
00:52:20,348 --> 00:52:22,350
Hurry up

841
00:52:23,852 --> 00:52:24,978
I am coming

842
00:52:26,187 --> 00:52:27,522
We can't beg for good
if we are late!

843
00:52:27,605 --> 00:52:28,940
Yes…

844
00:52:48,918 --> 00:52:49,502
Give me money please

845
00:52:49,586 --> 00:52:50,795
Go, go , I won't give you money

846
00:52:50,879 --> 00:52:54,507
Go, don't stop me
from doing business

847
00:52:57,969 --> 00:52:59,054
Chan, dad is leaving

848
00:53:11,733 --> 00:53:14,694
Thank you…

849
00:53:21,493 --> 00:53:23,161
Thank you…

850
00:53:30,502 --> 00:53:31,503
Are you that mean?

851
00:53:31,586 --> 00:53:32,712
Why don't you write it yourself?

852
00:53:32,796 --> 00:53:35,590
You are off duty, so I just
want to lend it

853
00:53:36,591 --> 00:53:37,550
Don't you think I am idiot?

854
00:54:12,585 --> 00:54:13,503
Dad!

855
00:54:15,588 --> 00:54:16,423
What are you doing?

856
00:54:16,881 --> 00:54:20,343
I am cold… I am cold… Chan

857
00:54:22,345 --> 00:54:25,473
No, your body is as hot as fire

858
00:54:26,599 --> 00:54:27,350
Are you sick?

859
00:54:27,434 --> 00:54:28,935
I am not…

860
00:54:30,562 --> 00:54:31,396
It's late

861
00:54:32,522 --> 00:54:33,982
I have to search for food

862
00:54:35,984 --> 00:54:37,944
Lie down, I will go this time

863
00:54:38,570 --> 00:54:39,738
Are you go for begging?

864
00:54:40,697 --> 00:54:42,615
I have my own way to get food

865
00:54:43,033 --> 00:54:43,992
Take a rest now

866
00:54:44,075 --> 00:54:45,535
I will take you to the doctor after
getting some money

867
00:55:05,430 --> 00:55:06,806
You bastard, why don't you eat?

868
00:55:06,890 --> 00:55:09,267
You should eat more so as
to be strong!

869
00:55:12,354 --> 00:55:13,355
Finish it

870
00:55:13,646 --> 00:55:14,647
No, I am full

871
00:55:14,731 --> 00:55:17,067
You should take all the food

872
00:55:18,026 --> 00:55:20,070
OK, just forget it,
let's go home

873
00:55:21,404 --> 00:55:24,657
Come on, eat them all

874
00:55:27,702 --> 00:55:28,203
Little kid!

875
00:55:28,286 --> 00:55:29,037
What?

876
00:55:29,162 --> 00:55:29,829
May I…

877
00:55:29,913 --> 00:55:30,872
No

878
00:55:49,099 --> 00:55:55,188
Be merciful!

879
00:55:57,899 --> 00:56:02,821
Be merciful to me please

880
00:56:05,198 --> 00:56:07,409
My dad is dying!

881
00:56:09,619 --> 00:56:11,579
Beggar, do you want
the broken carbon?

882
00:56:11,663 --> 00:56:12,789
Thank you

883
00:56:13,707 --> 00:56:15,417
Can you give me some coins?

884
00:56:16,501 --> 00:56:18,211
It's you!

885
00:56:18,586 --> 00:56:19,421
No, you have mistaken

886
00:56:19,963 --> 00:56:21,423
Sister, it's him

887
00:56:21,715 --> 00:56:22,674
No, no

888
00:56:22,716 --> 00:56:24,592
Sister, he is So Chan

889
00:56:28,263 --> 00:56:29,139
Wait!

890
00:56:33,768 --> 00:56:35,729
Miss, who are you looking for?

891
00:56:38,148 --> 00:56:39,733
I am sorry, I have mistaken

892
00:56:40,191 --> 00:56:41,735
Tracy, take some dumpling out

893
00:56:42,110 --> 00:56:44,112
You have mistake,
he is not So Chan

894
00:56:45,697 --> 00:56:46,740
You are like my friend

895
00:56:47,657 --> 00:56:50,326
Come to get some dumplings if you
get nothing to eat

896
00:56:51,244 --> 00:56:52,746
We always have surplus

897
00:56:54,497 --> 00:56:55,206
Dumpling

898
00:56:55,331 --> 00:56:56,291
Take it

899
00:57:00,003 --> 00:57:01,588
Thank you…

900
00:57:04,341 --> 00:57:05,091
Sister, he wouldn't
be that poor

901
00:57:05,175 --> 00:57:07,927
if not were you

902
00:57:21,649 --> 00:57:23,693
Dad, what are you doing?

903
00:57:23,777 --> 00:57:26,279
I can't stand the hunger

904
00:57:26,363 --> 00:57:29,783
So I bit the dumpling of the kid

905
00:57:30,533 --> 00:57:32,118
I have dumpling, take it back

906
00:57:32,202 --> 00:57:32,994
Could I pay you another head

907
00:57:33,078 --> 00:57:35,163
if I chopped yours

908
00:57:37,582 --> 00:57:38,958
Are you the Scholar?

909
00:57:41,086 --> 00:57:43,254
Yes, are you the Scholar?

910
00:57:44,631 --> 00:57:45,340
I was nearly the Scholar

911
00:57:45,423 --> 00:57:47,008
He is the Scholar!

912
00:57:47,384 --> 00:57:48,843
We should give him face

913
00:57:48,927 --> 00:57:50,804
Thank you

914
00:57:50,887 --> 00:57:53,014
Hold it

915
00:57:55,183 --> 00:57:56,810
Are they going to treat me

916
00:57:56,893 --> 00:57:59,229
some food?

917
00:58:02,941 --> 00:58:03,858
The dog's rice

918
00:58:04,776 --> 00:58:07,987
Sir, I will let your dad go if you eat
the dog's rice now

919
00:58:13,076 --> 00:58:13,952
What's the matter?

920
00:58:14,744 --> 00:58:15,745
Come on

921
00:58:26,172 --> 00:58:27,757
Chan, don't eat that

922
00:58:27,841 --> 00:58:29,300
You can't face the
others if you eat this

923
00:58:30,301 --> 00:58:32,137
Let's forget about me

924
00:58:32,470 --> 00:58:34,931
Sir, I was a general in Canton

925
00:58:36,850 --> 00:58:37,517
So what?

926
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:38,518
Stop fighting

927
00:58:38,601 --> 00:58:39,978
Stand properly

928
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:49,112
The Scholar eats the dog's food

929
00:58:50,780 --> 00:58:51,865
It's quite delicious

930
00:58:54,743 --> 00:58:57,037
Try some. Come on

931
00:59:00,915 --> 00:59:03,460
It's delicious, isn't it?

932
00:59:08,048 --> 00:59:09,341
Dad, look!

933
00:59:10,175 --> 00:59:11,426
There is a slice of meat here

934
00:59:11,509 --> 00:59:13,428
It's pock chop!

935
00:59:23,605 --> 00:59:25,231
They are as hungry as dogs!

936
00:59:25,315 --> 00:59:27,150
Enjoy the dog food!

937
00:59:29,361 --> 00:59:31,946
Hurry, finish it

938
00:59:33,198 --> 00:59:34,366
That's too delicious!

939
00:59:34,741 --> 00:59:36,743
I want to save it
for midnight snack

940
00:59:36,826 --> 00:59:37,744
It's very clever of you!

941
00:59:38,078 --> 00:59:39,913
You deserve to be beggars

942
00:59:42,457 --> 00:59:43,917
The Scholar is eating dog's food

943
00:59:44,084 --> 00:59:45,210
Come on, let's go and
eat the man's food

944
00:59:51,675 --> 00:59:52,801
Uncle So!

945
00:59:57,681 --> 00:59:58,973
You are…

946
00:59:59,474 --> 01:00:01,059
My dad was the Master of the
Beggar's Association

947
01:00:01,434 --> 01:00:03,645
Why don't you join our Beggar's
Association

948
01:00:04,104 --> 01:00:05,230
Uncle Mok, isn't it a good idea?

949
01:00:05,313 --> 01:00:06,147
Good

950
01:00:06,231 --> 01:00:07,899
Isn't it the association
for beggars?

951
01:00:07,941 --> 01:00:08,817
Yes!

952
01:00:08,900 --> 01:00:10,777
That's right,
we are being beggars

953
01:00:10,860 --> 01:00:12,904
It's wise to join the Beggars' Association
so as to be taken care

954
01:00:12,946 --> 01:00:15,323
Chan…
where is that fool going?

955
01:00:15,407 --> 01:00:16,574
Where is Chan?

956
01:00:16,658 --> 01:00:17,951
OK, we will join you!

957
01:00:18,034 --> 01:00:20,370
Chan… Chan…

958
01:00:32,549 --> 01:00:35,176
Yushang, good year!

959
01:00:35,260 --> 01:00:37,345
Uncle Mok, happy new year!

960
01:00:37,429 --> 01:00:38,680
This is for you

961
01:00:39,097 --> 01:00:40,390
Thank you

962
01:00:42,475 --> 01:00:43,727
One clothe is for you

963
01:00:43,810 --> 01:00:44,894
and the other is for Chan

964
01:00:45,895 --> 01:00:47,355
Thank you. Put it down first

965
01:00:49,065 --> 01:00:49,858
Do you have any coins?

966
01:00:49,941 --> 01:00:50,775
Yes!

967
01:00:50,859 --> 01:00:51,943
Give them to me, come on

968
01:00:51,985 --> 01:00:52,944
What for?

969
01:00:52,986 --> 01:00:54,863
It's new year,

970
01:00:54,946 --> 01:00:56,698
you should receive red pocket

971
01:00:56,781 --> 01:00:58,324
Come on, happy new year

972
01:00:58,950 --> 01:00:59,659
Good year!

973
01:00:59,743 --> 01:01:00,952
Wish you ever beauty

974
01:01:00,994 --> 01:01:01,745
Thank you…

975
01:01:01,828 --> 01:01:02,829
Uncle Mok, we needn't give red
pocket to each other

976
01:01:02,912 --> 01:01:03,997
How about Chan

977
01:01:04,330 --> 01:01:08,710
Chan?

978
01:01:08,877 --> 01:01:10,003
He is still sleeping

979
01:01:10,086 --> 01:01:12,213
Don't wake him up

980
01:01:13,048 --> 01:01:14,507
I will cook you some new year cake

981
01:01:15,133 --> 01:01:17,927
Let me help you

982
01:01:19,471 --> 01:01:21,181
How can he sleep on the
1st day of this year?

983
01:01:22,557 --> 01:01:24,392
He is useless

984
01:01:27,395 --> 01:01:28,355
Are you all here?

985
01:01:29,272 --> 01:01:32,025
To fight against Chiu, we need a union of
the Beggar's Association

986
01:01:33,401 --> 01:01:35,737
So we must choose a new master to
in-charge the association

987
01:01:37,030 --> 01:01:38,948
Yushang…

988
01:01:40,116 --> 01:01:41,951
To defeat the Lotus position
of the three seniors

989
01:01:42,035 --> 01:01:43,036
You should try your best

990
01:01:43,870 --> 01:01:46,748
Uncle, I don't have
faith to defeat them

991
01:01:47,207 --> 01:01:49,000
Judging from my kung-fu now,

992
01:01:49,084 --> 01:01:51,586
how can I defeat them and become
the new master?

993
01:01:53,380 --> 01:01:56,591
Take this Taiwan pill, after this,
your power will be improved

994
01:01:57,342 --> 01:02:00,261
No, this is the only medicine to cure
your inner injury

995
01:02:00,345 --> 01:02:01,429
How can I take this?

996
01:02:01,846 --> 01:02:03,014
Don't worry,

997
01:02:03,056 --> 01:02:05,266
you can ask my
son to fight for you

998
01:02:05,350 --> 01:02:07,936
He was a scholar
of Martial Arts before…

999
01:02:08,019 --> 01:02:09,104
Before…

1000
01:02:09,187 --> 01:02:10,730
Look at him, he is son lazy,

1001
01:02:10,814 --> 01:02:12,816
he knows sleeping only

1002
01:02:13,191 --> 01:02:15,026
He is not even
qualified to be beggar!

1003
01:02:15,110 --> 01:02:16,611
Don't be that frank, can you?

1004
01:02:18,071 --> 01:02:19,447
Don't shout that loudly, OK?

1005
01:02:28,331 --> 01:02:32,836
Chan, no matter
how they despise you,

1006
01:02:34,421 --> 01:02:36,089
I have faith on you

1007
01:02:37,215 --> 01:02:39,092
Although you lost your power

1008
01:02:39,634 --> 01:02:41,177
With your background,

1009
01:02:41,553 --> 01:02:43,054
only you try hard,

1010
01:02:43,096 --> 01:02:45,140
you can achieve something

1011
01:02:45,557 --> 01:02:47,559
But I am now powerless,
I don't want to fight again

1012
01:02:47,642 --> 01:02:48,893
You have power!

1013
01:02:48,977 --> 01:02:49,936
Come on, beat me

1014
01:02:54,024 --> 01:02:55,275
See, that was powerful

1015
01:02:55,650 --> 01:02:57,277
Well, being a people…

1016
01:02:57,819 --> 01:02:59,404
Forget it, don't waste time

1017
01:02:59,487 --> 01:03:01,031
Why don't you let me sleep?

1018
01:03:07,203 --> 01:03:07,954
Why did you lock the door?

1019
01:03:08,038 --> 01:03:09,164
Enjoy sleeping

1020
01:03:24,054 --> 01:03:24,846
Son,

1021
01:03:24,929 --> 01:03:27,640
I tried very hard
to get this for you

1022
01:03:28,058 --> 01:03:31,144
Try hard to practise, be good

1023
01:03:54,209 --> 01:03:55,293
Why do you go up?

1024
01:03:56,419 --> 01:03:58,088
Even you want me
to practise Kung-fu,

1025
01:03:58,171 --> 01:04:00,507
you should give me a waddy first

1026
01:04:02,175 --> 01:04:03,802
I am sorry, catch it

1027
01:04:12,602 --> 01:04:15,271
Before being appointed
important task,

1028
01:04:15,355 --> 01:04:20,485
God will give you severe
training for soul and flesh.

1029
01:04:27,575 --> 01:04:30,245
Did you write it?

1030
01:04:31,204 --> 01:04:36,084
It's ugly, it's right
to wipe it away

1031
01:04:38,086 --> 01:04:40,130
Hey, beggar?

1032
01:04:40,505 --> 01:04:41,131
Yes

1033
01:04:41,214 --> 01:04:42,090
Me too

1034
01:04:42,674 --> 01:04:43,675
Congratulation

1035
01:04:44,384 --> 01:04:46,177
Are there anything to eat?

1036
01:04:46,261 --> 01:04:47,262
No

1037
01:04:47,345 --> 01:04:48,847
Luckily, I have

1038
01:04:54,644 --> 01:04:57,480
See your look,

1039
01:04:57,564 --> 01:04:58,690
it's a waste
for you not to beg

1040
01:04:59,315 --> 01:05:00,400
None of your damn business

1041
01:05:01,609 --> 01:05:02,902
You are too lazy to be a beggar!

1042
01:05:02,986 --> 01:05:04,529
Your fellows despise you

1043
01:05:07,115 --> 01:05:08,825
I was always respected by others

1044
01:05:09,284 --> 01:05:10,577
But now, I am despised

1045
01:05:11,244 --> 01:05:12,495
Dislike from you,

1046
01:05:12,579 --> 01:05:14,581
no one respected me before

1047
01:05:14,998 --> 01:05:18,084
Listen to me. Don't go!

1048
01:05:18,752 --> 01:05:23,006
I remembered once in Canton

1049
01:05:23,089 --> 01:05:26,051
A fool paid my living,
including hooking

1050
01:05:26,134 --> 01:05:27,677
What a weird man

1051
01:05:30,555 --> 01:05:32,098
Kid, I remembered you

1052
01:05:32,807 --> 01:05:34,768
Me too

1053
01:05:34,851 --> 01:05:35,977
Hey, hurry up

1054
01:05:36,061 --> 01:05:37,520
Repay my money,
I am in urgent need

1055
01:05:37,645 --> 01:05:38,730
If I had money,

1056
01:05:38,813 --> 01:05:41,191
I wouldn't be beggar!

1057
01:05:45,278 --> 01:05:47,906
But, don't worry,
you were my benefitor,

1058
01:05:47,989 --> 01:05:49,199
I will repay you one day

1059
01:05:51,034 --> 01:05:52,535
Thank you very much

1060
01:05:53,745 --> 01:05:55,080
But, you can't buy
back what you lost

1061
01:05:55,372 --> 01:05:57,040
even you have money again

1062
01:05:58,708 --> 01:05:59,584
What did I lose?

1063
01:05:59,668 --> 01:06:02,087
Pride and faith

1064
01:06:02,170 --> 01:06:03,880
And your woman too

1065
01:06:06,466 --> 01:06:07,467
What are you?

1066
01:06:07,842 --> 01:06:11,805
I am Hung Yat-sun,
nicked name Old Bag Sun

1067
01:06:11,888 --> 01:06:15,350
I am the most senior
one among the beggars

1068
01:06:15,433 --> 01:06:16,685
It's good to be beggar

1069
01:06:17,143 --> 01:06:18,770
You can do everything you want

1070
01:06:18,853 --> 01:06:20,063
You can do the same

1071
01:06:20,146 --> 01:06:22,816
Tell me, what do you want?
I will make your wish come true

1072
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:24,275
I want to be human again

1073
01:06:24,359 --> 01:06:26,069
Don't you think you
are not human like?

1074
01:06:27,612 --> 01:06:28,947
Not at all

1075
01:06:29,030 --> 01:06:31,491
So you have to be beggar now

1076
01:06:33,952 --> 01:06:36,579
Very good! Very good!

1077
01:06:37,163 --> 01:06:40,458
But I won't cheat you,
from your head to toes

1078
01:06:40,542 --> 01:06:42,794
Every parts of you are beggar like

1079
01:06:44,337 --> 01:06:45,005
So what?

1080
01:06:45,088 --> 01:06:47,465
That means, you will be beggar
for your life

1081
01:06:50,385 --> 01:06:52,846
I don't want to talk to you,
I want a sleep first

1082
01:06:53,346 --> 01:06:55,348
Don't go, you can achieve
in your profession

1083
01:06:55,473 --> 01:06:56,558
From my judgement,

1084
01:06:56,641 --> 01:06:58,309
you will be the king of beggars

1085
01:06:58,852 --> 01:07:01,271
King of beggars,
what does that mean?

1086
01:07:03,106 --> 01:07:04,149
That is beggar

1087
01:07:08,319 --> 01:07:10,280
I won't care who you are,
I just want to stop the conversation

1088
01:07:10,363 --> 01:07:12,323
Please step aside,
don't stop me from sleeping

1089
01:07:13,116 --> 01:07:14,117
Damn you!

1090
01:07:14,242 --> 01:07:16,453
No… I just want to sleep with you

1091
01:07:17,704 --> 01:07:18,538
Idiot!

1092
01:07:22,625 --> 01:07:25,253
Kid, see you in the dream

1093
01:07:36,514 --> 01:07:38,933
Before the Buddha, the Disciples
returns to your position

1094
01:07:40,393 --> 01:07:43,646
To suppress the dragon and tight

1095
01:07:50,653 --> 01:07:53,031
So Chan, you enjoyed the
prosperity of the world

1096
01:07:53,114 --> 01:07:54,908
And you tasted the bitter
fruit of the world too

1097
01:07:55,325 --> 01:07:56,618
Now you regretted

1098
01:07:56,993 --> 01:07:59,704
On behalf of Master Hung

1099
01:07:59,788 --> 01:08:01,373
I appoint you to be the
"Sleeping Disciple"

1100
01:08:01,414 --> 01:08:05,293
Now, I will teach you the
"Sleeping Disciple's Fist"!

1101
01:08:05,377 --> 01:08:07,837
Hope you can make good use of it.
Come on

1102
01:08:13,218 --> 01:08:17,597
Senior…

1103
01:08:22,727 --> 01:08:25,355
The bitter pasted

1104
01:08:30,276 --> 01:08:33,822
Long life to you…

1105
01:08:36,449 --> 01:08:38,993
Here comes the white Goat

1106
01:08:39,661 --> 01:08:43,790
My mother, give me power

1107
01:08:44,416 --> 01:08:45,458
To save the people!

1108
01:09:06,938 --> 01:09:08,648
Tomorrow the Emperor
will go hunting

1109
01:09:09,065 --> 01:09:11,943
I will send him a pretty girl,
so as to get close to him

1110
01:09:13,903 --> 01:09:17,073
Yuen Ling, you should
seduce him tomorrow

1111
01:09:17,574 --> 01:09:18,450
Yes

1112
01:09:19,951 --> 01:09:21,369
If we can kill the Emperor,

1113
01:09:21,911 --> 01:09:23,288
I can take over his reign

1114
01:09:23,997 --> 01:09:26,499
I will give you a share of wealth!

1115
01:09:31,546 --> 01:09:35,008
Long life to you

1116
01:09:35,759 --> 01:09:36,468
Senior!

1117
01:09:36,551 --> 01:09:37,719
Let's go back now

1118
01:10:09,751 --> 01:10:10,377
Senior!

1119
01:10:10,460 --> 01:10:11,127
Let's go!

1120
01:10:24,265 --> 01:10:25,100
Senior!

1121
01:11:04,222 --> 01:11:04,931
Let's chase them

1122
01:11:05,015 --> 01:11:08,226
Stop.
The Emperor is setting off soon

1123
01:11:09,769 --> 01:11:10,895
You killed woman…

1124
01:11:11,229 --> 01:11:12,397
You should replace her to be
a gift to the Emperor!

1125
01:11:18,778 --> 01:11:20,989
No one dares come up to fight for
the leadership?

1126
01:11:21,573 --> 01:11:23,783
Ask Mok to give us the
"Dog Hitting Waddy"!

1127
01:11:25,869 --> 01:11:29,748
Ask that old bag to
hand us the waddy

1128
01:11:29,914 --> 01:11:33,043
Where have they been?

1129
01:11:33,626 --> 01:11:34,753
I don't know,

1130
01:11:35,462 --> 01:11:37,589
I saw them chat,

1131
01:11:37,630 --> 01:11:38,673
then they went away

1132
01:11:41,426 --> 01:11:42,594
Are there any affair between them?

1133
01:11:54,397 --> 01:11:55,732
Now, we are going to choose
the new leader

1134
01:12:02,572 --> 01:12:03,531
Uncle Mok…

1135
01:12:03,615 --> 01:12:04,532
I am scared,

1136
01:12:04,616 --> 01:12:05,325
I think you won't come back

1137
01:12:05,450 --> 01:12:06,534
How is it? Where is sister?

1138
01:12:07,660 --> 01:12:09,204
Your sister is caught by Chiu

1139
01:12:09,871 --> 01:12:11,831
We'd find someone to compete
for the leadership

1140
01:12:18,129 --> 01:12:19,589
Who should go?

1141
01:12:34,187 --> 01:12:34,771
I'll do it

1142
01:12:34,854 --> 01:12:35,647
Uncle Mok

1143
01:12:35,730 --> 01:12:37,232
Why don't you let me try?

1144
01:13:14,894 --> 01:13:15,854
Chan,

1145
01:13:17,772 --> 01:13:19,691
you are not qualified, come down

1146
01:13:21,276 --> 01:13:24,154
Since you don't have a good candidate,
I'll give you some advantage

1147
01:13:24,696 --> 01:13:26,573
Chan, it's not a game

1148
01:13:26,990 --> 01:13:28,742
You will be killed, come down

1149
01:13:29,159 --> 01:13:31,828
It doesn't matter, I have forgotten
my life already

1150
01:13:32,245 --> 01:13:33,288
Bull shit, throw him to death

1151
01:13:43,131 --> 01:13:44,758
Well, I will make
your wish come true

1152
01:14:13,703 --> 01:14:14,245
What is he doing?

1153
01:14:14,329 --> 01:14:15,038
Sleeping

1154
01:14:29,886 --> 01:14:31,304
Isn't this stance…

1155
01:14:32,347 --> 01:14:34,349
Uncle Sun's "Sleeping Disciple's Fists'?

1156
01:14:35,350 --> 01:14:36,226
Set the position!

1157
01:14:52,575 --> 01:14:53,535
Is it dawn?

1158
01:15:52,218 --> 01:15:53,428
I am sorry!

1159
01:15:53,887 --> 01:15:54,804
I won

1160
01:15:54,888 --> 01:15:56,097
What is the use for defeating us?

1161
01:15:56,181 --> 01:15:57,057
You don't know how to use the
"Dog Hitting Waddy".

1162
01:15:58,058 --> 01:15:59,100
You are not qualified to be
the leader of us

1163
01:16:02,645 --> 01:16:04,064
"Dog Hitting Waddy"?

1164
01:16:08,610 --> 01:16:09,736
It's for hitting dogs

1165
01:16:11,780 --> 01:16:13,114
I do know how to use this waddy!

1166
01:16:13,615 --> 01:16:14,616
But it's dislike
from the standard stances!

1167
01:16:14,991 --> 01:16:15,617
It's quite powerful!

1168
01:16:20,538 --> 01:16:21,956
He broke the waddy!

1169
01:16:23,917 --> 01:16:26,169
He broke the treasure of our Association,
let's kill him!

1170
01:16:40,266 --> 01:16:42,268
I am Master Hung,
who dares go against me?

1171
01:16:43,728 --> 01:16:45,313
I set the rules of the association

1172
01:16:45,397 --> 01:16:48,233
Any student who defeated
the Lotus Position

1173
01:16:48,316 --> 01:16:50,235
could be the leader

1174
01:16:50,860 --> 01:16:52,404
Have you all forgotten?

1175
01:16:53,029 --> 01:16:55,323
We becomes the
biggest association

1176
01:16:55,407 --> 01:16:57,117
because of being united

1177
01:16:57,784 --> 01:16:59,994
I left you the
"Dog Hitting Waddy",

1178
01:17:00,078 --> 01:17:02,372
is just for memory

1179
01:17:02,789 --> 01:17:05,041
The waddy is meaningless

1180
01:17:05,125 --> 01:17:07,335
But you fools take
this as treasure

1181
01:17:07,419 --> 01:17:10,588
And fight among yourselves for
this damn waddy!

1182
01:17:10,672 --> 01:17:13,341
In these five years, you have had no
leader, don't you feel shy?

1183
01:17:13,925 --> 01:17:15,218
So Chan broke the waddy,

1184
01:17:15,301 --> 01:17:16,428
so you won't fight
for this anymore

1185
01:17:16,511 --> 01:17:17,762
He is correct to do so

1186
01:17:18,054 --> 01:17:19,431
This youngster is so junior,

1187
01:17:19,514 --> 01:17:20,974
but he is a genius, a smart ass

1188
01:17:21,057 --> 01:17:23,268
He is being taught by my disciple
Hung Yat Sun

1189
01:17:23,351 --> 01:17:24,978
Who doesn't respect him is going
against me too

1190
01:17:26,855 --> 01:17:27,939
You should respect him,

1191
01:17:28,023 --> 01:17:29,315
your new leader,
and you'd love him,

1192
01:17:29,399 --> 01:17:32,944
whole-heartedly, to care much for him,
maybe, treat him dinner

1193
01:17:32,986 --> 01:17:34,195
Then, although I am in heaven,

1194
01:17:34,279 --> 01:17:38,199
I will bless all of you,
all the best

1195
01:17:40,410 --> 01:17:41,911
Isn't it true?

1196
01:17:43,163 --> 01:17:44,998
You'd better trust it

1197
01:17:45,415 --> 01:17:47,625
Master Hung's soul talked to us,

1198
01:17:47,709 --> 01:17:49,544
we are blessed

1199
01:17:50,628 --> 01:17:53,006
They are easily to be cheated,
I am really a genius!

1200
01:17:53,923 --> 01:17:55,133
We'll have better living

1201
01:17:57,469 --> 01:17:59,346
What happened?

1202
01:18:01,181 --> 01:18:02,432
Let's greet the new Master

1203
01:18:05,810 --> 01:18:10,273
You should have faith,
you won, bravo…

1204
01:18:12,108 --> 01:18:14,277
Uncle Mok, my son is really great!

1205
01:18:16,821 --> 01:18:18,531
I can't guess you have learnt the
"Sleeping Disciple's Fists"?!

1206
01:18:20,742 --> 01:18:23,244
From now on, you are the new leader of us

1207
01:18:24,454 --> 01:18:26,331
This is the book of
"Dragon Suppressing Stances"

1208
01:18:26,414 --> 01:18:28,041
And, I will give you the Taiwan Pill

1209
01:18:29,167 --> 01:18:31,127
Hope you will be a good leader

1210
01:18:32,420 --> 01:18:34,255
I just want to save Yushang as
soon as possible

1211
01:18:36,424 --> 01:18:38,218
Yushang didn't make a wrong choice

1212
01:18:39,135 --> 01:18:43,473
Bravo! Bravo!

1213
01:18:48,061 --> 01:18:51,314
Uncle Mok, how are you?

1214
01:18:52,399 --> 01:18:54,401
Uncle Mok!

1215
01:18:55,819 --> 01:19:00,073
Uncle Mok…

1216
01:19:49,372 --> 01:19:50,290
Do you understand everything

1217
01:19:50,373 --> 01:19:52,792
written in this book?

1218
01:19:52,876 --> 01:19:54,252
Don't think that I am so foolish

1219
01:19:54,753 --> 01:19:56,129
After getting the
help of Taiwan Pill

1220
01:19:56,212 --> 01:19:59,132
My initial power is increased

1221
01:19:59,924 --> 01:20:02,510
I can control the 17th stances

1222
01:20:02,927 --> 01:20:05,597
But the last stance,

1223
01:20:05,680 --> 01:20:07,057
there is no picture
or description of it

1224
01:20:07,390 --> 01:20:08,641
I can't understand at all

1225
01:20:09,142 --> 01:20:12,145
But Uncle Mok is dead, what'll we do now?

1226
01:20:12,687 --> 01:20:13,688
Just go ahead

1227
01:20:13,772 --> 01:20:15,899
No matter how, I have to save
Yushang first

1228
01:21:27,762 --> 01:21:29,389
Check whether the camp is ready or not?

1229
01:21:29,472 --> 01:21:30,432
Yes!

1230
01:21:50,285 --> 01:21:51,244
Chiu,

1231
01:21:51,661 --> 01:21:54,205
why do you bring this woman here?

1232
01:21:54,289 --> 01:21:55,623
I know the Emperor
loves pretty woman

1233
01:21:55,707 --> 01:21:58,084
So I want to send him this gift

1234
01:21:58,543 --> 01:21:59,794
And I want to meet him too

1235
01:22:00,211 --> 01:22:02,339
There is no order from the Emperor

1236
01:22:02,964 --> 01:22:05,175
Men, come and take
this woman to the camp

1237
01:22:05,258 --> 01:22:06,384
Yes

1238
01:22:06,968 --> 01:22:07,844
Go!

1239
01:22:10,805 --> 01:22:13,683
Sir, you look great!

1240
01:22:15,143 --> 01:22:17,020
I think you should go back

1241
01:22:17,395 --> 01:22:18,563
to your own position

1242
01:22:19,230 --> 01:22:20,273
Yes

1243
01:22:36,206 --> 01:22:37,040
Your Majesty,

1244
01:22:37,123 --> 01:22:39,125
Officer Chiu brings this woman to you

1245
01:22:40,085 --> 01:22:40,877
Woman?

1246
01:22:43,296 --> 01:22:44,464
Chiu knows my hobby!

1247
01:22:45,382 --> 01:22:47,592
I want to take a bath first,
bring her to me later

1248
01:22:47,676 --> 01:22:48,677
Yes

1249
01:23:11,491 --> 01:23:14,536
This bastard wants
to see the Emperor,

1250
01:23:15,745 --> 01:23:18,832
if I let him see His Majesty oftenly,
my post will be taken away

1251
01:23:23,962 --> 01:23:24,838
Men

1252
01:23:26,548 --> 01:23:27,382
Sir

1253
01:23:27,465 --> 01:23:28,633
Check what had happened

1254
01:23:28,717 --> 01:23:29,718
Yes

1255
01:23:33,138 --> 01:23:35,932
Sir, there are many people coming
from the forest

1256
01:23:36,349 --> 01:23:37,475
Who are they?

1257
01:23:38,268 --> 01:23:39,269
I don't know!

1258
01:23:40,103 --> 01:23:40,854
Release the alarm smoke

1259
01:23:40,937 --> 01:23:41,688
Be alert

1260
01:23:41,771 --> 01:23:42,689
Yes

1261
01:23:52,115 --> 01:23:53,700
There is smoke ahead,
let's get armed

1262
01:23:53,783 --> 01:23:54,617
Yes

1263
01:24:56,554 --> 01:24:57,555
Damn you beggars

1264
01:25:02,435 --> 01:25:04,354
So Chan, what are you doing?

1265
01:25:05,313 --> 01:25:08,483
Nothing, I just want
to beg for money

1266
01:25:09,025 --> 01:25:11,277
Shit, do you want to be killed

1267
01:25:11,653 --> 01:25:12,821
It's you who will be killed

1268
01:25:14,364 --> 01:25:15,740
Chiu wants to raise a rebel,

1269
01:25:15,824 --> 01:25:17,325
he is going to
assassinate the king

1270
01:25:17,409 --> 01:25:18,618
You fat-headed

1271
01:25:19,828 --> 01:25:21,162
Who do you think you are?

1272
01:25:21,454 --> 01:25:23,873
How dare you frame the courtier?

1273
01:25:24,416 --> 01:25:26,459
I will kill you if you step forward

1274
01:25:31,006 --> 01:25:33,466
Chan, how can we fight with them?

1275
01:25:33,550 --> 01:25:34,634
- Senior
- Yes

1276
01:25:35,468 --> 01:25:36,511
Where are the rest of our men?

1277
01:25:36,594 --> 01:25:37,929
They are coming

1278
01:25:39,764 --> 01:25:40,890
We have no time,

1279
01:25:40,974 --> 01:25:42,517
you stay here to wait for the others

1280
01:25:42,600 --> 01:25:43,309
I will go first

1281
01:25:43,435 --> 01:25:44,019
I will follow

1282
01:25:44,102 --> 01:25:44,936
Be serious

1283
01:25:45,020 --> 01:25:46,479
Master, don't worry

1284
01:25:47,230 --> 01:25:48,732
Am I going to die?

1285
01:25:48,815 --> 01:25:50,483
Say something lucky, OK?

1286
01:25:50,859 --> 01:25:55,447
Sure! Happy birthday to you…

1287
01:25:55,488 --> 01:25:58,491
Happy birthday to you…

1288
01:25:58,908 --> 01:26:00,243
Happy birthday to you…

1289
01:26:00,326 --> 01:26:01,286
That's enough

1290
01:26:01,411 --> 01:26:02,370
I haven't finished

1291
01:26:02,454 --> 01:26:03,413
Go on after I left

1292
01:26:03,496 --> 01:26:04,539
Sure

1293
01:26:16,551 --> 01:26:18,553
There is smoke ahead,
someone must have alarmed them

1294
01:26:21,556 --> 01:26:22,390
Get ready the Unicom Smoke

1295
01:26:22,474 --> 01:26:22,974
Yes

1296
01:26:23,058 --> 01:26:24,017
Attack the main camp

1297
01:27:24,994 --> 01:27:28,206
Rebel! Help!

1298
01:27:28,998 --> 01:27:29,833
They should be killed

1299
01:27:29,958 --> 01:27:31,835
The one who didn't kill you
should be killed

1300
01:27:33,128 --> 01:27:35,338
Shit, the poisoned smoke

1301
01:27:35,422 --> 01:27:36,631
is blowing to the Royal camp

1302
01:27:42,804 --> 01:27:44,472
No, the wind direction changed

1303
01:27:45,223 --> 01:27:46,766
Yes, wait for me

1304
01:27:48,977 --> 01:27:51,104
If the beggars don't retreat now,
we will kill with no mercy

1305
01:28:10,206 --> 01:28:11,207
Have a look

1306
01:28:15,587 --> 01:28:16,629
The Unicom Smoke of
the Tin Li Sect

1307
01:28:27,682 --> 01:28:29,976
Be calm, urine is the antidote
to the poison

1308
01:28:31,019 --> 01:28:33,271
Come and piss

1309
01:28:37,233 --> 01:28:38,860
How about me?

1310
01:28:39,527 --> 01:28:41,363
Don't worry,
I can give you some urine

1311
01:28:41,446 --> 01:28:42,405
Come on, hold it

1312
01:28:48,828 --> 01:28:49,788
Rush in!

1313
01:28:59,172 --> 01:28:59,923
How is the situation?

1314
01:29:00,006 --> 01:29:02,008
Thanks for Your Majesty's luck,
the wind direction changed

1315
01:29:02,133 --> 01:29:03,593
The smoke is going
to the other direction

1316
01:29:03,677 --> 01:29:05,178
How about our armies?

1317
01:29:05,261 --> 01:29:06,971
They are all dead

1318
01:29:08,056 --> 01:29:08,932
Take me the sword

1319
01:29:09,015 --> 01:29:09,974
Don't… don't!

1320
01:29:10,100 --> 01:29:11,643
Get lost! Get lost!

1321
01:29:11,685 --> 01:29:13,728
Your Majesty, it's dangerous,
don't go!

1322
01:29:13,812 --> 01:29:16,690
Get lost, don't you want
to wait for death, get lost

1323
01:29:18,108 --> 01:29:19,150
You are ordered to get away

1324
01:29:19,818 --> 01:29:22,237
You can't go!

1325
01:30:00,650 --> 01:30:01,818
Protect me

1326
01:30:26,885 --> 01:30:27,761
Chan?

1327
01:30:29,929 --> 01:30:30,722
Yushang

1328
01:30:30,805 --> 01:30:32,098
How did you get here?

1329
01:30:32,724 --> 01:30:34,642
It's a long story

1330
01:30:34,726 --> 01:30:36,603
We left our base last night

1331
01:30:36,728 --> 01:30:37,854
We reached the Great Wall

1332
01:30:37,937 --> 01:30:40,190
this morning

1333
01:30:40,273 --> 01:30:42,275
We stayed one hour for lunch

1334
01:30:42,359 --> 01:30:43,735
I pissed once

1335
01:30:43,818 --> 01:30:44,652
Really?

1336
01:30:44,736 --> 01:30:45,987
Yes, then I want to
eat a sweet potato

1337
01:30:46,112 --> 01:30:47,072
But only dumpling left

1338
01:30:47,155 --> 01:30:49,532
You know, I don't
like eating dumpling

1339
01:30:50,700 --> 01:30:52,702
I am late to save you,
please forgive me

1340
01:30:55,121 --> 01:30:55,872
To protect to Emperor

1341
01:30:56,373 --> 01:30:57,332
Yes

1342
01:31:00,669 --> 01:31:01,336
You betrayer!

1343
01:31:01,419 --> 01:31:02,128
Catch him

1344
01:31:08,593 --> 01:31:09,386
Your Majesty

1345
01:31:12,847 --> 01:31:14,641
You bastard, give your kingdom to me

1346
01:31:14,724 --> 01:31:15,850
Are you telling him?

1347
01:31:18,978 --> 01:31:19,771
It's you

1348
01:31:19,813 --> 01:31:21,439
Yes, I am Beggar So

1349
01:31:22,232 --> 01:31:25,193
Why don't you sleep in your hut?

1350
01:31:25,652 --> 01:31:27,821
Well, I am a little bit sleepy

1351
01:32:05,108 --> 01:32:05,900
"Sleeping Disciple"?

1352
01:32:06,443 --> 01:32:10,363
Yes. Look at you, you are
like beggar too

1353
01:32:10,447 --> 01:32:11,948
Are you interested to join us?

1354
01:32:13,867 --> 01:32:15,994
I can't guess you could recover!

1355
01:32:16,453 --> 01:32:18,163
Yes, it's all because of you

1356
01:32:22,709 --> 01:32:24,711
Did you generate all your force?
I didn't

1357
01:32:43,355 --> 01:32:46,483
Fool, only the "Dragon Suppressing
Stances" scare me

1358
01:32:46,524 --> 01:32:48,276
I won't give a damn
to any other stances

1359
01:33:00,830 --> 01:33:02,665
"Dragon Suppress Stances"

1360
01:33:05,335 --> 01:33:06,461
"Dragon in the sky"

1361
01:33:08,088 --> 01:33:08,797
"Dragon swings its tail"

1362
01:33:09,089 --> 01:33:09,798
"Dragon steals the heart"

1363
01:33:09,881 --> 01:33:10,674
Dragon swims,
dragon in the field,

1364
01:33:10,840 --> 01:33:11,883
dragon dances…

1365
01:33:11,925 --> 01:33:12,884
Dragon's descendant,

1366
01:33:12,967 --> 01:33:14,010
dragon's wish…

1367
01:33:14,094 --> 01:33:15,345
Dragon's spirit, dragon's couple

1368
01:33:15,428 --> 01:33:16,805
Finished

1369
01:33:51,297 --> 01:33:53,800
You can't finish the last stance,

1370
01:33:53,883 --> 01:33:54,926
you can defeat me

1371
01:33:55,135 --> 01:33:56,136
after learning the 18th stance

1372
01:33:56,261 --> 01:33:57,512
But you have no chance

1373
01:34:05,854 --> 01:34:06,688
Chan!

1374
01:34:21,244 --> 01:34:23,496
I've got it.
Just mix the 17 stances,

1375
01:34:23,580 --> 01:34:24,539
it's the 18th stance then

1376
01:34:25,206 --> 01:34:26,833
I am too smart!

1377
01:34:56,863 --> 01:34:59,199
The 18 stance, "It's a regret to
kill the Dragon"!

1378
01:35:29,312 --> 01:35:31,189
Chan, are you alright?

1379
01:35:31,606 --> 01:35:33,108
See, don't you
think I am alright?

1380
01:35:34,025 --> 01:35:35,151
Your post is really smart

1381
01:35:35,235 --> 01:35:37,028
But your look is awful!

1382
01:35:37,070 --> 01:35:38,154
Idiot, I am fine

1383
01:35:38,238 --> 01:35:39,531
I can marry tonight

1384
01:35:52,502 --> 01:35:53,044
Sister!

1385
01:35:53,128 --> 01:35:54,004
Tracy!

1386
01:35:54,087 --> 01:35:54,963
Where is Chiu?

1387
01:35:56,047 --> 01:35:56,965
He is around

1388
01:35:57,215 --> 01:35:58,550
Around?

1389
01:35:58,967 --> 01:36:00,218
He became ash

1390
01:36:01,094 --> 01:36:02,721
Damn it!

1391
01:36:02,804 --> 01:36:04,097
Master

1392
01:36:04,180 --> 01:36:06,016
Chiu's fellows are
all caught by us

1393
01:36:10,228 --> 01:36:11,312
Thank you, buddies

1394
01:36:15,483 --> 01:36:16,276
Yushang

1395
01:36:16,359 --> 01:36:18,028
We have an agreement,
do you remember?

1396
01:36:19,404 --> 01:36:22,615
Yes, be the top of all

1397
01:36:22,699 --> 01:36:24,909
Invincible

1398
01:36:25,243 --> 01:36:26,953
But, I can't be the Scholar

1399
01:36:27,037 --> 01:36:29,956
But I don't like Scholar at all

1400
01:36:30,290 --> 01:36:31,708
I love beggar

1401
01:36:33,668 --> 01:36:34,919
You first, I will go after you

1402
01:36:48,516 --> 01:36:51,811
Seng-ko-lin-ch'in,
you are really a fool

1403
01:36:51,895 --> 01:36:53,563
You bring a thief to harm me

1404
01:36:54,147 --> 01:36:55,899
Now, you are titled to be a beggar

1405
01:36:56,399 --> 01:36:58,735
You have potential to be beggar

1406
01:36:59,486 --> 01:37:00,653
Report duty in the temple tomorrow

1407
01:37:01,279 --> 01:37:02,697
If there anyone bullies you,
just tell them my name

1408
01:37:04,366 --> 01:37:06,534
Thank you, thank you master

1409
01:37:06,618 --> 01:37:09,454
So Chan, what do you want as reward?

1410
01:37:12,415 --> 01:37:13,500
Don't you have anything to tell me?

1411
01:37:18,088 --> 01:37:20,131
Nothing special, let's go

1412
01:37:22,967 --> 01:37:24,678
Mister So!

1413
01:37:24,761 --> 01:37:25,929
Put it down

1414
01:37:26,304 --> 01:37:27,347
Although you have saved me,

1415
01:37:27,430 --> 01:37:29,891
if you don't respect me, I will kill you

1416
01:37:30,809 --> 01:37:33,019
If so, you needn't
squat and talk to me

1417
01:37:33,812 --> 01:37:36,439
Don't move, it'll
attract their attention

1418
01:37:39,359 --> 01:37:40,944
Actually we have no relation,

1419
01:37:41,027 --> 01:37:42,696
we have nothing to chat

1420
01:37:43,196 --> 01:37:44,656
You have billions of fellows

1421
01:37:44,739 --> 01:37:47,117
Your force makes me worry

1422
01:37:48,201 --> 01:37:50,245
The number of fellow doesn't
depend on me,

1423
01:37:50,328 --> 01:37:51,413
but you

1424
01:37:51,496 --> 01:37:52,580
What?

1425
01:37:53,665 --> 01:37:56,292
If you are great, making the
society peace and wealthy,

1426
01:37:56,668 --> 01:37:58,795
no one wishes to be beggar, right?

1427
01:38:00,380 --> 01:38:02,090
It's reasonable

1428
01:38:02,173 --> 01:38:03,091
Be smart

1429
01:38:03,925 --> 01:38:04,926
But,

1430
01:38:05,552 --> 01:38:07,595
give me some face

1431
01:38:08,847 --> 01:38:09,681
Yes

1432
01:38:09,764 --> 01:38:12,183
Long life to Your Majesty

1433
01:38:12,225 --> 01:38:13,560
Get up

1434
01:38:19,691 --> 01:38:21,109
Pal, do you know me?

1435
01:38:21,609 --> 01:38:23,361
Of course! You beggar

1436
01:38:23,445 --> 01:38:25,155
You beg with your girl, you think I'll
give you money out of mercy?

1437
01:38:25,238 --> 01:38:26,406
Yes, please give me money

1438
01:38:26,489 --> 01:38:28,658
No mercy, go away

1439
01:38:28,742 --> 01:38:29,743
No, you should pay me

1440
01:38:30,243 --> 01:38:31,536
It's a must, pal

1441
01:38:32,370 --> 01:38:34,831
A must? Kidding?

1442
01:38:35,290 --> 01:38:37,500
It's true, be quick

1443
01:38:37,584 --> 01:38:38,585
It's bad luck to meet you

1444
01:38:39,044 --> 01:38:40,003
Stop

1445
01:38:40,086 --> 01:38:40,920
What?

1446
01:38:41,004 --> 01:38:44,049
See my family? Give more

1447
01:38:44,132 --> 01:38:45,216
How much?

1448
01:38:45,258 --> 01:38:46,676
Not less than a thousand, got me?

1449
01:38:51,348 --> 01:38:52,891
Say thank you now

1450
01:38:52,974 --> 01:38:55,810
Thank you, uncle
