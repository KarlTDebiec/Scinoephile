1
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:17,971
Young master, we are ready

2
00:02:59,763 --> 00:03:00,472
What's a hard job for you,
young master

3
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:01,473
The towel, young master

4
00:03:10,816 --> 00:03:12,318
What did he write?

5
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:13,402
His name!

6
00:03:13,777 --> 00:03:17,489
Great! Young master knows how to
write his name!

7
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:18,615
Yes!

8
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:19,908
Damn!

9
00:03:25,289 --> 00:03:26,123
Nice calligraphy

10
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:28,459
Get lost

11
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:34,965
Nice calligraphy!
So Cha Ha Yee Chan!

12
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:36,884
It's reversed, Master

13
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:38,927
Chan Yee Ha Cha So

14
00:03:39,803 --> 00:03:42,639
Good boy, but, don't be proud!
Got me?

15
00:03:44,892 --> 00:03:47,478
Dad, since the first
emperor of the Ching Dynasty,

16
00:03:47,603 --> 00:03:49,313
our family

17
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:51,189
has been illiterate

18
00:03:51,273 --> 00:03:54,401
But not, my son,
that's your grandson,

19
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:56,403
he knows how to write his name!

20
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:59,572
Dad, it's very great!

21
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:01,533
He knows writing now,

22
00:04:01,617 --> 00:04:03,494
he will be a scholar one day

23
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:04,828
Now, he knows how to write his name,

24
00:04:04,912 --> 00:04:06,872
he will have a son later

25
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:09,749
Young master,
you should try hard to learn

26
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:12,085
Chan, I think,
we should mount it

27
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:12,836
OK

28
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,005
Professor, show it in
some obvious places

29
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,131
By the way, one minute,

30
00:04:16,215 --> 00:04:18,968
why don't you carry it with traditional
decoration in the street?

31
00:04:19,051 --> 00:04:19,635
What?

32
00:04:19,718 --> 00:04:20,552
Let's go!

33
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:22,971
Chan, come and sit...

34
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:26,100
I am so pleased that you are that
hard-working and filial

35
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:30,145
Listen to me, I am notorious for being
a spendthrift

36
00:04:30,229 --> 00:04:32,732
My fortune is almost used up

37
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:35,525
If I die one day,

38
00:04:35,943 --> 00:04:37,445
you should depend on yourself

39
00:04:37,528 --> 00:04:38,571
I used to depend on myself

40
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:41,865
The cheque is worth 100,000 taels!
Don't be an extravagant spender

41
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:44,576
Give me the imported hat

42
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:45,744
Where are you going?
Chan!

43
00:04:46,537 --> 00:04:47,329
I am having a grand
birthday party tonight

44
00:04:48,664 --> 00:04:49,456
How old are you?

45
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:51,625
25 years old. Come earlier

46
00:04:52,251 --> 00:04:54,795
But you should dress up first

47
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:56,546
You are like a beggar!

48
00:04:57,047 --> 00:04:59,132
How can a beggar be that rich?!
I do want to be a rich beggar!

49
00:05:02,386 --> 00:05:03,637
That fat-headed...

50
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,721
Come over here

51
00:05:05,097 --> 00:05:06,098
What's the matter?

52
00:05:06,598 --> 00:05:09,476
The invitation card
of my son is great!

53
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,104
If I hold a birthday party in the future,
I want a better invitation card!

54
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:34,668
Your Majesty, how do you think about
the Cantonese Opera?

55
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:39,089
For sure, it can't compete
with Peking Opera!

56
00:05:39,631 --> 00:05:41,883
But, I appreciate
to view this

57
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:46,763
Money...

58
00:05:47,598 --> 00:05:50,392
Tips. Tips...

59
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:51,726
Happy birthday to you, Mr So

60
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:53,979
I am homeless and sick...

61
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:57,607
I am poor, I am damn poor!

62
00:05:57,983 --> 00:05:58,859
Please give me some money

63
00:05:58,942 --> 00:05:59,860
Kidding? Damn you beggar!

64
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:02,487
How can you beg here?

65
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:03,739
Go to hell!

66
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:04,614
Give him tips

67
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:05,824
Yes, young master

68
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:08,034
Are you kidding?
How can you give him tips?

69
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:10,579
A beggar is a man too

70
00:06:10,662 --> 00:06:12,122
Everyone can come here
if he has money

71
00:06:12,206 --> 00:06:13,124
Your living,

72
00:06:13,207 --> 00:06:15,501
including the expenditure for hooking,
I will pay for you!

73
00:06:15,584 --> 00:06:16,418
You pay it?

74
00:06:16,502 --> 00:06:17,420
So what?

75
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:20,505
Nothing!

76
00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:21,965
Please follow me

77
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:25,177
Come into my room...

78
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:27,179
Mr So!

79
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:28,722
Hello...

80
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:29,723
How are you, Madam Pimp?

81
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:31,891
It's very bad of
you to call me that!

82
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:33,644
Just be frank, why not?

83
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:34,728
You should be frank!

84
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:37,522
Your hat, is like
the mourning uniform!

85
00:06:37,606 --> 00:06:38,941
Has your dad passed away?

86
00:06:40,484 --> 00:06:42,569
I feel happy to talk in this way

87
00:06:43,779 --> 00:06:46,865
Mr Chiu, you helped me to terminate
the Hairy Gang,

88
00:06:46,949 --> 00:06:49,076
the emperor will
give you award for this

89
00:06:49,868 --> 00:06:51,620
I'll appreciate it if you

90
00:06:51,703 --> 00:06:53,038
speak something nice in front of
the emperor

91
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:56,249
Please have the towel

92
00:07:00,462 --> 00:07:02,756
Mr So has come

93
00:07:03,215 --> 00:07:04,758
Congratulations!

94
00:07:04,842 --> 00:07:05,926
This way...

95
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:08,261
Mr So, today is your big day,
you must be very happy!

96
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:10,556
We have some new girls,
you must be satisfied with them

97
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:11,765
What are they?
Gold fish, or cooked fish?

98
00:07:11,849 --> 00:07:13,726
What does that mean?

99
00:07:13,809 --> 00:07:15,769
You idiot! Gold fish is
for watching only

100
00:07:15,853 --> 00:07:17,146
Cooked fish can be eaten

101
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:19,606
Cooked fish of course

102
00:07:19,898 --> 00:07:21,775
You, cooked fishes, why don't you
come and serve Mr So?

103
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:24,903
Mr So, you are the
superior master today

104
00:07:24,987 --> 00:07:26,906
What kind of woman do you want?
Just tell me

105
00:07:27,322 --> 00:07:29,407
I won't mind,
every woman is just the same

106
00:07:29,491 --> 00:07:30,534
Nothing special

107
00:07:36,248 --> 00:07:37,791
Mr So, what's the matter?

108
00:07:38,584 --> 00:07:39,710
I am attacked

109
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:40,460
What? Who dared so?

110
00:07:40,544 --> 00:07:42,171
I will hit that
bastard's mouth for you

111
00:07:42,254 --> 00:07:43,172
She didn't use her mouth

112
00:07:43,255 --> 00:07:44,339
She used her eyes

113
00:07:44,423 --> 00:07:47,343
Tempting, and I smell blood.
I haven't seen such eyesight before.

114
00:07:48,093 --> 00:07:49,970
Who is she?

115
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:52,055
Miss Yushang comes to be a part-time
hooker only

116
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:54,224
Is Mr Chiu interested to sleep with her?

117
00:07:54,308 --> 00:07:55,643
You should ask His Majesty first

118
00:07:55,726 --> 00:07:57,061
How is it? Your Majesty?

119
00:07:57,686 --> 00:08:00,314
We are friends,
just go ahead if you want!

120
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:02,149
Mr Chiu, help yourself

121
00:08:03,108 --> 00:08:04,443
Thank you then

122
00:08:04,526 --> 00:08:05,485
The room service please

123
00:08:05,861 --> 00:08:08,864
Yushang, come and greet Mr Chiu

124
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:12,867
Sister, he is the one we want

125
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:14,369
He killed dad

126
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:15,746
I know, stay calm

127
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:16,496
Let's go

128
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:17,498
May I be excused?

129
00:08:17,581 --> 00:08:19,249
Mr Chiu, Miss Yushang has arrived

130
00:08:22,127 --> 00:08:25,756
How are you, Mr Chiu?

131
00:08:30,886 --> 00:08:31,929
A pretty woman!

132
00:08:33,764 --> 00:08:36,642
Mr Chiu, about tonight...

133
00:08:36,725 --> 00:08:37,851
$100,000

134
00:08:37,935 --> 00:08:40,855
if Miss Yushang sleeps with our
young master tonight...

135
00:08:40,938 --> 00:08:42,523
You are not welcome

136
00:08:42,606 --> 00:08:45,400
I am sorry, I am damn sorry

137
00:08:45,484 --> 00:08:46,527
Don't you have any objection?

138
00:08:47,611 --> 00:08:50,155
Let me say something fair

139
00:08:50,239 --> 00:08:51,574
If any of you can offer

140
00:08:51,657 --> 00:08:52,950
more than $100,000

141
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:54,701
Yushang will sleep with whomever

142
00:08:54,785 --> 00:08:56,412
Don't quarrel because of such
small amount,

143
00:08:56,495 --> 00:08:58,038
isn't it right?

144
00:08:58,121 --> 00:08:59,789
Pal, you are a big spender

145
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:02,876
The cheque is too simple to me

146
00:09:04,628 --> 00:09:08,465
I have a pearl which is granted by the
Royal family, it's invaluable!

147
00:09:11,969 --> 00:09:13,679
I love the pearl more

148
00:09:15,597 --> 00:09:18,266
Mr Chiu, I will wait for
you in my room

149
00:09:19,101 --> 00:09:20,811
Is the pearl worth $100,000?

150
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:23,855
Don't you think that's
too little for you?

151
00:09:23,939 --> 00:09:25,149
I love money too

152
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:27,401
But, I don't like you

153
00:09:31,113 --> 00:09:33,574
You are frank!
I love it!

154
00:09:33,657 --> 00:09:34,616
Mr So...

155
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:35,534
It doesn't matter,

156
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:37,244
I think, my hat doesn't match me

157
00:09:37,369 --> 00:09:40,414
Yushang doesn't like me,
I deserve it

158
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:41,707
I am glad you understand this

159
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:42,666
Don't worry,

160
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:44,292
I have many pretty girls here

161
00:09:44,376 --> 00:09:47,254
I trust your arrangement

162
00:09:50,215 --> 00:09:51,717
None of my business

163
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,176
How bold are you?

164
00:10:02,811 --> 00:10:05,147
Mantis Fist?
It seems to be powerful

165
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:06,189
Music!

166
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:14,781
Keep this

167
00:10:15,991 --> 00:10:16,617
Watch my Crane Fists!

168
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:17,451
The Tiger Claws!

169
00:10:22,456 --> 00:10:25,376
How can a mantis fight with a tiger?

170
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:27,753
I know Tiger Claws
and Crane's Fists too!

171
00:10:29,421 --> 00:10:31,173
Well, try me, mantis!

172
00:10:44,728 --> 00:10:46,605
Bravo...

173
00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:48,982
Your Tiger's claws are defeated

174
00:10:51,109 --> 00:10:52,277
Actually, it's not Tiger's Claws,

175
00:10:52,361 --> 00:10:53,821
it's a beggar's fists!

176
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:55,322
That's why it's too weak
