1
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:17,971
Young master, we are ready

2
00:02:59,763 --> 00:03:00,472
What's a hard job for you,
young master

3
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:01,473
The towel, young master

4
00:03:10,816 --> 00:03:12,318
What did he write?

5
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:13,402
His name!

6
00:03:13,777 --> 00:03:17,489
Great! Young master knows how to
write his name!

7
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:18,615
Yes!

8
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:19,908
Damn!

9
00:03:25,289 --> 00:03:26,123
Nice calligraphy

10
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:28,459
Get lost

11
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:34,965
Nice calligraphy!
So Cha Ha Yee Chan!

12
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:36,884
It's reversed, Master

13
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:38,927
Chan Yee Ha Cha So

14
00:03:39,803 --> 00:03:42,639
Good boy, but, don't be proud!
Got me?

15
00:03:44,892 --> 00:03:47,478
Dad, since the first
emperor of the Ching Dynasty,

16
00:03:47,603 --> 00:03:49,313
our family

17
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:51,189
has been illiterate

18
00:03:51,273 --> 00:03:54,401
But not, my son,
that's your grandson,

19
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:56,403
he knows how to write his name!

20
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:59,572
Dad, it's very great!

21
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:01,533
He knows writing now,

22
00:04:01,617 --> 00:04:03,494
he will be a scholar one day

23
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:04,828
Now, he knows how to write his name,

24
00:04:04,912 --> 00:04:06,872
he will have a son later

25
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:09,749
Young master,
you should try hard to learn

26
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:12,085
Chan, I think,
we should mount it

27
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:12,836
OK

28
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,005
Professor, show it in
some obvious places

29
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,131
By the way, one minute,

30
00:04:16,215 --> 00:04:18,968
why don't you carry it with traditional
decoration in the street?

31
00:04:19,051 --> 00:04:19,635
What?

32
00:04:19,718 --> 00:04:20,552
Let's go!

33
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:22,971
Chan, come and sit...

34
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:26,100
I am so pleased that you are that
hard-working and filial

35
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:30,145
Listen to me, I am notorious for being
a spendthrift

36
00:04:30,229 --> 00:04:32,732
My fortune is almost used up

37
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:35,525
If I die one day,

38
00:04:35,943 --> 00:04:37,445
you should depend on yourself

39
00:04:37,528 --> 00:04:38,571
I used to depend on myself

40
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:41,865
The cheque is worth 100,000 taels!
Don't be an extravagant spender

41
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:44,576
Give me the imported hat

42
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:45,744
Where are you going?
Chan!

43
00:04:46,537 --> 00:04:47,329
I am having a grand
birthday party tonight

44
00:04:48,664 --> 00:04:49,456
How old are you?

45
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:51,625
25 years old. Come earlier

46
00:04:52,251 --> 00:04:54,795
But you should dress up first

47
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:56,546
You are like a beggar!

48
00:04:57,047 --> 00:04:59,132
How can a beggar be that rich?!
I do want to be a rich beggar!

49
00:05:02,386 --> 00:05:03,637
That fat-headed...

50
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,721
Come over here

51
00:05:05,097 --> 00:05:06,098
What's the matter?

52
00:05:06,598 --> 00:05:09,476
The invitation card
of my son is great!

53
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,104
If I hold a birthday party in the future,
I want a better invitation card!

54
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:34,668
Your Majesty, how do you think about
the Cantonese Opera?

55
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:39,089
For sure, it can't compete
with Peking Opera!

56
00:05:39,631 --> 00:05:41,883
But, I appreciate
to view this

57
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:46,763
Money...

58
00:05:47,598 --> 00:05:50,392
Tips. Tips...

59
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:51,726
Happy birthday to you, Mr So

60
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:53,979
I am homeless and sick...

61
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:57,607
I am poor, I am damn poor!

62
00:05:57,983 --> 00:05:58,859
Please give me some money

63
00:05:58,942 --> 00:05:59,860
Kidding? Damn you beggar!

64
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:02,487
How can you beg here?

65
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:03,739
Go to hell!

66
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:04,614
Give him tips

67
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:05,824
Yes, young master

68
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:08,034
Are you kidding?
How can you give him tips?

69
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:10,579
A beggar is a man too

70
00:06:10,662 --> 00:06:12,122
Everyone can come here
if he has money

71
00:06:12,206 --> 00:06:13,124
Your living,

72
00:06:13,207 --> 00:06:15,501
including the expenditure for hooking,
I will pay for you!

73
00:06:15,584 --> 00:06:16,418
You pay it?

74
00:06:16,502 --> 00:06:17,420
So what?

75
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:20,505
Nothing!

76
00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:21,965
Please follow me

77
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:25,177
Come into my room...

78
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:27,179
Mr So!

79
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:28,722
Hello...

80
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:29,723
How are you, Madam Pimp?

81
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:31,891
It's very bad of
you to call me that!

82
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:33,644
Just be frank, why not?

83
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:34,728
You should be frank!

84
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:37,522
Your hat, is like
the mourning uniform!

85
00:06:37,606 --> 00:06:38,941
Has your dad passed away?

86
00:06:40,484 --> 00:06:42,569
I feel happy to talk in this way

87
00:06:43,779 --> 00:06:46,865
Mr Chiu, you helped me to terminate
the Hairy Gang,

88
00:06:46,949 --> 00:06:49,076
the emperor will
give you award for this

89
00:06:49,868 --> 00:06:51,620
I'll appreciate it if you

90
00:06:51,703 --> 00:06:53,038
speak something nice in front of
the emperor

91
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:56,249
Please have the towel

92
00:07:00,462 --> 00:07:02,756
Mr So has come

93
00:07:03,215 --> 00:07:04,758
Congratulations!

94
00:07:04,842 --> 00:07:05,926
This way...

95
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:08,261
Mr So, today is your big day,
you must be very happy!

96
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:10,556
We have some new girls,
you must be satisfied with them

97
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:11,765
What are they?
Gold fish, or cooked fish?

98
00:07:11,849 --> 00:07:13,726
What does that mean?

99
00:07:13,809 --> 00:07:15,769
You idiot! Gold fish is
for watching only

100
00:07:15,853 --> 00:07:17,146
Cooked fish can be eaten

101
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:19,606
Cooked fish of course

102
00:07:19,898 --> 00:07:21,775
You, cooked fishes, why don't you
come and serve Mr So?

103
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:24,903
Mr So, you are the
superior master today

104
00:07:24,987 --> 00:07:26,906
What kind of woman do you want?
Just tell me

105
00:07:27,322 --> 00:07:29,407
I won't mind,
every woman is just the same

106
00:07:29,491 --> 00:07:30,534
Nothing special

107
00:07:36,248 --> 00:07:37,791
Mr So, what's the matter?

108
00:07:38,584 --> 00:07:39,710
I am attacked

109
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:40,460
What? Who dared so?

110
00:07:40,544 --> 00:07:42,171
I will hit that
bastard's mouth for you

111
00:07:42,254 --> 00:07:43,172
She didn't use her mouth

112
00:07:43,255 --> 00:07:44,339
She used her eyes

113
00:07:44,423 --> 00:07:47,343
Tempting, and I smell blood.
I haven't seen such eyesight before.

114
00:07:48,093 --> 00:07:49,970
Who is she?

115
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:52,055
Miss Yushang comes to be a part-time
hooker only

116
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:54,224
Is Mr Chiu interested to sleep with her?

117
00:07:54,308 --> 00:07:55,643
You should ask His Majesty first

118
00:07:55,726 --> 00:07:57,061
How is it? Your Majesty?

119
00:07:57,686 --> 00:08:00,314
We are friends,
just go ahead if you want!

120
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:02,149
Mr Chiu, help yourself

121
00:08:03,108 --> 00:08:04,443
Thank you then

122
00:08:04,526 --> 00:08:05,485
The room service please

123
00:08:05,861 --> 00:08:08,864
Yushang, come and greet Mr Chiu

124
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:12,867
Sister, he is the one we want

125
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:14,369
He killed dad

126
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:15,746
I know, stay calm

127
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:16,496
Let's go

128
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:17,498
May I be excused?

129
00:08:17,581 --> 00:08:19,249
Mr Chiu, Miss Yushang has arrived

130
00:08:22,127 --> 00:08:25,756
How are you, Mr Chiu?

131
00:08:30,886 --> 00:08:31,929
A pretty woman!

132
00:08:33,764 --> 00:08:36,642
Mr Chiu, about tonight...

133
00:08:36,725 --> 00:08:37,851
$100,000

134
00:08:37,935 --> 00:08:40,855
if Miss Yushang sleeps with our
young master tonight...

135
00:08:40,938 --> 00:08:42,523
You are not welcome

136
00:08:42,606 --> 00:08:45,400
I am sorry, I am damn sorry

137
00:08:45,484 --> 00:08:46,527
Don't you have any objection?

138
00:08:47,611 --> 00:08:50,155
Let me say something fair

139
00:08:50,239 --> 00:08:51,574
If any of you can offer

140
00:08:51,657 --> 00:08:52,950
more than $100,000

141
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:54,701
Yushang will sleep with whomever

142
00:08:54,785 --> 00:08:56,412
Don't quarrel because of such
small amount,

143
00:08:56,495 --> 00:08:58,038
isn't it right?

144
00:08:58,121 --> 00:08:59,789
Pal, you are a big spender

145
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:02,876
The cheque is too simple to me

146
00:09:04,628 --> 00:09:08,465
I have a pearl which is granted by the
Royal family, it's invaluable!

147
00:09:11,969 --> 00:09:13,679
I love the pearl more

148
00:09:15,597 --> 00:09:18,266
Mr Chiu, I will wait for
you in my room

149
00:09:19,101 --> 00:09:20,811
Is the pearl worth $100,000?

150
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:23,855
Don't you think that's
too little for you?

151
00:09:23,939 --> 00:09:25,149
I love money too

152
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:27,401
But, I don't like you

153
00:09:31,113 --> 00:09:33,574
You are frank!
I love it very much

154
00:09:33,657 --> 00:09:34,616
Mr So...

155
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:35,534
It doesn't matter,

156
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:37,244
I think, my hat doesn't match me

157
00:09:37,369 --> 00:09:40,414
Yushang doesn't like me,
I deserve it

158
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:41,707
I am glad you understand this

159
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:42,666
Don't worry,

160
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:44,292
I have many pretty girls here

161
00:09:44,376 --> 00:09:47,254
I trust your arrangement

162
00:09:50,215 --> 00:09:51,717
None of my business

163
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,176
How bold are you?

164
00:10:02,811 --> 00:10:05,147
Mantis Fist?
It seems to be powerful

165
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:06,189
Music!

166
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:14,781
Keep this

167
00:10:15,991 --> 00:10:16,617
See my Crane's Fists!

168
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:17,451
The Tiger's Claws!

169
00:10:22,456 --> 00:10:25,376
How can a mantis fight with a tiger?

170
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:27,753
I know Tiger Claws
and Crane's Fists too!

171
00:10:29,421 --> 00:10:31,173
Well, try me, mantis!

172
00:10:44,728 --> 00:10:46,605
Bravo...

173
00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:48,982
Your Tiger's claws are defeated

174
00:10:51,109 --> 00:10:52,277
Actually it's not Tiger's Claws,

175
00:10:52,361 --> 00:10:53,821
it's beggar's fists!

176
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:55,322
That's why it's too weak

177
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:02,996
You move fast!

178
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:04,456
It seems to be powerful...

179
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:09,294
Kid, you don't know how
the wind blows

180
00:11:16,552 --> 00:11:17,970
The general of
Canton has arrived

181
00:11:18,053 --> 00:11:20,764
Get lost...

182
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:23,391
Who dares bully my son?
Let me teach him a lesson.

183
00:11:24,226 --> 00:11:25,018
Master

184
00:11:25,102 --> 00:11:26,562
Don't panic, Chan who bullied you?

185
00:11:26,645 --> 00:11:27,563
It's me who bullied others

186
00:11:27,646 --> 00:11:29,148
What? You bullied others?

187
00:11:29,523 --> 00:11:31,358
How much does he have?
Is he even qualified to be bullied by you?

188
00:11:31,859 --> 00:11:32,818
Master, they are the ones

189
00:11:32,901 --> 00:11:33,360
Who are they?

190
00:11:33,443 --> 00:11:34,819
Just take a look

191
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,114
The King of Iron Hat?

192
00:11:41,118 --> 00:11:42,036
Send the gift

193
00:11:42,119 --> 00:11:42,745
Chan

194
00:11:42,828 --> 00:11:44,371
They sent you such a valuable present,
you should stop bullying them.

195
00:11:44,872 --> 00:11:45,998
Come on, give tips to the girls here

196
00:11:46,081 --> 00:11:46,790
Master

197
00:11:46,874 --> 00:11:49,126
King of Iron Hat, Seng-ko-lin-ch'in,
is written on the medal.

198
00:11:59,845 --> 00:12:01,305
How dare you seize the medal
of His Majesty?

199
00:12:01,805 --> 00:12:02,431
Cuff him

200
00:12:02,514 --> 00:12:04,766
Hold it, according to the Ching's law,

201
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:07,394
Courtiers are not allowed to partake in hooking

202
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:08,895
Now, you are in the brothel

203
00:12:08,979 --> 00:12:11,023
Do you know you have violated
the laws of Ching?

204
00:12:11,523 --> 00:12:12,441
How about you?

205
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:14,109
- You mean me?
- Yes!

206
00:12:14,193 --> 00:12:16,237
That's right, I come...

207
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,112
- to arrest...
- You!

208
00:12:17,321 --> 00:12:18,864
- Him!
- Arrest him!

209
00:12:19,323 --> 00:12:20,407
I am the general of Canton,

210
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:22,909
so I should arrest
those bad people

211
00:12:22,993 --> 00:12:24,036
By the way...

212
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:25,829
What else? Go ahead

213
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:29,374
Today is the birthday of
the Ex-Empress Dowager

214
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:31,627
So your crime is doubled

215
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:32,836
It may result in capital punishment

216
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,423
Kill him...

217
00:12:39,718 --> 00:12:40,886
According to the Ching laws,

218
00:12:40,969 --> 00:12:43,138
anyone without a tail should be killed

219
00:12:43,222 --> 00:12:45,099
So you...

220
00:12:47,976 --> 00:12:49,019
Do you want to see my hair?

221
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:50,395
You can see as much as you want!
Fathead.

222
00:12:50,479 --> 00:12:52,856
Cut the crap, just kill him

223
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:54,859
OK, it's finished

224
00:12:55,192 --> 00:12:57,569
General So, let's play happily together,
so just forget it.

225
00:12:57,653 --> 00:12:58,988
I haven't played!

226
00:12:59,905 --> 00:13:00,656
Your Majesty,

227
00:13:00,739 --> 00:13:02,991
a rascal has ruined
the atmosphere here,

228
00:13:03,075 --> 00:13:03,909
I should be blamed
for poor arrangement

229
00:13:04,576 --> 00:13:05,410
None of your business

230
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:07,120
Let's go

231
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:12,626
Master, you can't fool this guy.
Let's go.

232
00:13:13,669 --> 00:13:14,295
OK, go

233
00:13:15,546 --> 00:13:17,506
Just forget the trouble

234
00:13:20,384 --> 00:13:22,678
Young master, your hat

235
00:13:29,643 --> 00:13:30,769
He is great!

236
00:13:39,862 --> 00:13:42,782
Uncle Mok, the dishes
are all poisoned

237
00:13:42,865 --> 00:13:46,869
Chiu assassinated our Master

238
00:13:46,952 --> 00:13:48,954
and some generals of
The Taiping Reign

239
00:13:49,037 --> 00:13:50,539
And he framed us, the Beggars Association,
to be the assassins

240
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:52,917
Thus made us

241
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:54,668
to be despised by the world

242
00:13:55,586 --> 00:13:56,962
Saying that we became the dogs
of the government

243
00:13:57,504 --> 00:13:59,673
I should ask him to pay for it

244
00:14:01,425 --> 00:14:02,843
His initial power is harmful

245
00:14:02,926 --> 00:14:05,429
Don't take action
until he is trapped

246
00:14:05,512 --> 00:14:07,889
Because we can't defeat him even
if we group together

247
00:14:08,223 --> 00:14:09,766
I will try my best to seduce
him to the bed

248
00:14:11,185 --> 00:14:12,436
Senior, somebody is coming

249
00:14:13,228 --> 00:14:14,271
Get ready...

250
00:14:22,738 --> 00:14:24,198
Miss Yushang, we meet again

251
00:14:24,281 --> 00:14:26,283
Why do you come here?
Where is Mister Chiu?

252
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:27,701
The pearl of Mr. Chiu is broken

253
00:14:27,784 --> 00:14:29,744
by Mr. So and became pearl powder

254
00:14:29,828 --> 00:14:31,121
I have drunk it

255
00:14:31,955 --> 00:14:33,832
Don't judge Mr So from his hair,

256
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:36,210
he is really romantic and funny

257
00:14:36,627 --> 00:14:37,294
But...

258
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:39,713
Stop, I have taken his money,
100,000 taels you know?

259
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:41,381
I won't give it back

260
00:14:41,715 --> 00:14:43,550
About the personality of Mr So...

261
00:14:43,634 --> 00:14:45,261
Cut the crap, pimp!

262
00:14:45,344 --> 00:14:46,178
Leave here first

263
00:14:46,261 --> 00:14:47,262
Yes, you are right

264
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:48,388
Miss Seven...

265
00:14:48,472 --> 00:14:49,932
Just accept this

266
00:14:54,728 --> 00:14:55,729
Who is this guy?

267
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:57,189
I don't know

268
00:14:57,231 --> 00:15:00,234
Miss, first of all, I have good news for you

269
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:02,152
I love you

270
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:05,114
To me, this is a bad news

271
00:15:05,697 --> 00:15:07,365
I know you will reply like this

272
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:08,742
Cut the crap

273
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:09,993
I wish to pay you 100 pearls

274
00:15:10,077 --> 00:15:12,997
for your company tonight

275
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,206
I don't want to talk to you

276
00:15:14,289 --> 00:15:15,332
Please get out

277
00:15:17,209 --> 00:15:18,335
I haven't chosen the wrong one

278
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:20,337
OK, I will drink this wine first

279
00:15:21,255 --> 00:15:22,256
No...

280
00:15:28,554 --> 00:15:30,806
It surprised me

281
00:15:32,015 --> 00:15:32,599
Miss

282
00:15:32,683 --> 00:15:33,559
Hands off!

283
00:15:35,686 --> 00:15:36,729
You know Kung-fu?

284
00:15:37,729 --> 00:15:39,439
No, I don't know Kung-fu at all

285
00:15:40,023 --> 00:15:41,942
I beg you, stop bothering me

286
00:15:42,025 --> 00:15:43,151
I won't accompany you

287
00:15:43,235 --> 00:15:45,779
Yushang, no one treats
me like this

288
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:48,323
I have found that
I am in love with you

289
00:15:50,075 --> 00:15:51,118
What?

290
00:15:51,618 --> 00:15:54,538
I have been in love with you

291
00:15:56,206 --> 00:15:57,332
Are you kidding?

292
00:15:57,708 --> 00:16:00,127
I am not kidding,
I decided to marry you

293
00:16:01,253 --> 00:16:02,337
Are you nuts?

294
00:16:04,047 --> 00:16:05,048
Kidding?

295
00:16:07,843 --> 00:16:09,303
Is anyone hiding here?

296
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:14,767
That's good, I want a witness

297
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:15,934
Witness?

298
00:16:16,018 --> 00:16:18,521
Yes, I swear in front of your sword

299
00:16:19,146 --> 00:16:20,814
I do want to marry Miss Yushang
as my wife, I am sincere

300
00:16:20,898 --> 00:16:23,067
If I cheat,
I will be killed by thunder

301
00:16:24,359 --> 00:16:26,444
Sister, I feel excited for you

302
00:16:26,528 --> 00:16:27,487
Hey

303
00:16:29,072 --> 00:16:30,407
Don't you know it isn't that easy
to be my husband?

304
00:16:30,908 --> 00:16:32,326
How can I be your husband?

305
00:16:34,119 --> 00:16:35,871
I want him to be the superior
Kung-fu master

306
00:16:35,954 --> 00:16:37,205
Be the top of all

307
00:16:37,289 --> 00:16:38,415
Can you do that?

308
00:16:39,374 --> 00:16:40,333
Let me think for one second

309
00:16:47,132 --> 00:16:48,050
I can do it

310
00:16:49,968 --> 00:16:50,886
OK

311
00:16:50,969 --> 00:16:53,472
Do it first and then look for me

312
00:16:54,348 --> 00:16:57,268
Well, I think we should fix a date
for our wedding

313
00:16:57,684 --> 00:17:00,312
Because this is too easy for me
to be the Kung-fu scholar!

314
00:17:01,271 --> 00:17:04,816
OK, but you should give me some time
to consider it

315
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:07,403
No problem, I will wait for your answer
outside the garden

316
00:17:08,362 --> 00:17:09,572
I won't leave until seeing you

317
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,160
Crazy!

318
00:17:38,141 --> 00:17:40,769
We come from the Beggars Association,
Those unrelated,  leave at once.

319
00:18:37,826 --> 00:18:40,579
Sir, the timing is right

320
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:42,956
The road is safe now, please go

321
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:47,044
Good, very good

322
00:18:49,588 --> 00:18:50,464
Let's go!
