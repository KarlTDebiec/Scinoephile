1
00:01:43,312 --> 00:01:44,314
Young master, we are ready

2
00:02:26,152 --> 00:02:26,862
What's a hard job for you,
young master

3
00:02:26,904 --> 00:02:27,864
The towel, young master

4
00:02:37,217 --> 00:02:38,720
What did he write?

5
00:02:38,804 --> 00:02:39,806
His name!

6
00:02:40,181 --> 00:02:43,897
Great! Young master knows how to
write his name!

7
00:02:43,939 --> 00:02:45,024
Yes!

8
00:02:45,149 --> 00:02:46,319
Damn!

9
00:02:51,706 --> 00:02:52,541
Nice calligraphy

10
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:54,879
Get lost

11
00:02:56,882 --> 00:03:01,392
Nice calligraphy!
So Cha Ha Yee Chan!

12
00:03:02,144 --> 00:03:03,313
It's reversed, Master

13
00:03:03,689 --> 00:03:05,359
Chan Yee Ha Cha So

14
00:03:06,235 --> 00:03:09,075
Good boy, but, don't be proud!
Got me?

15
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:13,919
Dad, since the first
emperor of the Ching Dynasty,

16
00:03:14,044 --> 00:03:15,756
our family

17
00:03:15,839 --> 00:03:17,634
has been illiterate

18
00:03:17,718 --> 00:03:20,849
But not, my son,
that's your grandson,

19
00:03:20,932 --> 00:03:22,854
he knows how to write his name!

20
00:03:22,937 --> 00:03:26,026
Dad, it's very great!

21
00:03:26,528 --> 00:03:27,989
He knows writing now,

22
00:03:28,073 --> 00:03:29,952
he will be scholar one day

23
00:03:30,035 --> 00:03:31,288
Now, he knows how to write his name,

24
00:03:31,372 --> 00:03:33,334
he will have a son later

25
00:03:33,835 --> 00:03:36,214
Young master,
you should try hard to learn

26
00:03:36,298 --> 00:03:38,553
Chan, I think,
we should mount it

27
00:03:38,637 --> 00:03:39,305
OK

28
00:03:39,389 --> 00:03:41,476
Professor, show it in
some obvious places

29
00:03:41,559 --> 00:03:42,603
By the way, one minute,

30
00:03:42,687 --> 00:03:45,443
why don't you carry it with traditional
decoration in the street?

31
00:03:45,526 --> 00:03:46,111
What?

32
00:03:46,194 --> 00:03:47,029
Let's go!

33
00:03:47,071 --> 00:03:49,451
Chan, come and sit…

34
00:03:50,077 --> 00:03:52,583
I am so pleased that you are that hard
working and filial

35
00:03:53,251 --> 00:03:56,632
Listen to me, I am notorious of being
a spendthrift

36
00:03:56,717 --> 00:03:59,222
My fortune is almost used up

37
00:03:59,304 --> 00:04:02,018
If I die one day,

38
00:04:02,437 --> 00:04:03,940
you should depend on yourself

39
00:04:04,024 --> 00:04:05,068
I used to depend on myself

40
00:04:06,695 --> 00:04:08,365
The cheques worth 100,000 taels!
Don't be an extravagant spender

41
00:04:09,284 --> 00:04:11,079
Give me the imported hat

42
00:04:11,121 --> 00:04:12,248
Where are you going?
Chan!

43
00:04:13,042 --> 00:04:13,835
I am having a grand
birthday party tonight

44
00:04:15,172 --> 00:04:15,965
How old are you?

45
00:04:16,049 --> 00:04:18,136
25 years old. Come earlier

46
00:04:18,763 --> 00:04:21,309
But you should dress up first

47
00:04:21,392 --> 00:04:23,062
You are like beggar!

48
00:04:23,564 --> 00:04:25,651
How can a beggar be that rich?!
I do want to be a rich beggar!

49
00:04:28,909 --> 00:04:30,161
That fat-headed…

50
00:04:30,244 --> 00:04:31,246
Come over here

51
00:04:31,623 --> 00:04:32,625
What's the matter?

52
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:36,006
The invitation card
of my son is great!

53
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:38,637
If I hold a birthday party in future,
I want a better invitation card!

54
00:04:58,303 --> 00:05:01,226
Your Majesty, what do you think about
the Cantonese Opera?

55
00:05:02,645 --> 00:05:05,652
For sure, it can't compete
with Peking Opera!

56
00:05:06,194 --> 00:05:08,449
But, I appreciate
to view this

57
00:05:10,662 --> 00:05:13,334
Money…

58
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:16,967
Tips. Tips…

59
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:18,303
Happy birthday to you, Mr So

60
00:05:18,387 --> 00:05:20,558
I am homeless and sick…

61
00:05:20,641 --> 00:05:24,190
I am poor, I am damn poor!

62
00:05:24,566 --> 00:05:25,443
Please give me some money

63
00:05:25,526 --> 00:05:26,445
Kidding? Damn you beggar!

64
00:05:26,529 --> 00:05:29,075
How can you beg here?

65
00:05:29,159 --> 00:05:30,329
Go to hell!

66
00:05:30,412 --> 00:05:31,205
Give him tips

67
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:32,416
Yes, young master

68
00:05:33,084 --> 00:05:34,628
Are you kidding?
How can you give him tips?

69
00:05:36,299 --> 00:05:37,176
A beggar is a man too

70
00:05:37,259 --> 00:05:38,721
Everyone can come here
if he has money

71
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:39,724
Your living,

72
00:05:39,807 --> 00:05:42,104
including the expenditure for hooking,
I will pay for you!

73
00:05:42,187 --> 00:05:43,022
You pay it?

74
00:05:43,106 --> 00:05:44,025
So what?

75
00:05:44,441 --> 00:05:47,113
Nothing!

76
00:05:47,197 --> 00:05:48,575
Please follow me

77
00:05:48,659 --> 00:05:51,790
Come into my room…

78
00:05:51,873 --> 00:05:53,794
Mr So!

79
00:05:53,877 --> 00:05:55,339
Hello…

80
00:05:55,422 --> 00:05:56,341
How are you, Madam Pimp?

81
00:05:56,424 --> 00:05:58,511
It's very bad of
you to call me that!

82
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:00,266
Just be frank, why not?

83
00:06:00,349 --> 00:06:01,352
You should be frank!

84
00:06:01,435 --> 00:06:04,149
Your hat is like
the mourning uniform!

85
00:06:04,233 --> 00:06:05,569
Has your dad passed away?

86
00:06:07,114 --> 00:06:09,201
I feel happy to talk in this way

87
00:06:10,412 --> 00:06:13,502
Mr Chiu, you helped me to terminate
the Hairy Gang,

88
00:06:13,586 --> 00:06:15,715
the emperor will
give you an award for this

89
00:06:16,508 --> 00:06:18,262
I'll appreciate it if you

90
00:06:18,345 --> 00:06:19,681
speak something nice in front of
the emperor

91
00:06:21,226 --> 00:06:22,896
Please have the towel

92
00:06:27,114 --> 00:06:29,410
Mr So has come.

93
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:31,414
Congratulations!

94
00:06:31,498 --> 00:06:32,584
This way…

95
00:06:32,667 --> 00:06:34,921
Mr So, today is your big day,
you must be very happy!

96
00:06:35,005 --> 00:06:37,219
We have some new girls,
you must be satisfied with them

97
00:06:37,302 --> 00:06:38,429
What are they?
Goldfish, or cooked fish?

98
00:06:38,513 --> 00:06:40,392
What does that mean?

99
00:06:40,475 --> 00:06:42,437
You idiot! Goldfish is
for watching only

100
00:06:42,521 --> 00:06:43,816
Cooked fish can be eaten

101
00:06:44,692 --> 00:06:46,279
Cooked fish of course

102
00:06:46,571 --> 00:06:48,450
You, cooked fishes, why don't you
come and serve Mr So?

103
00:06:49,786 --> 00:06:51,581
Mr So, you are the
superior master today.

104
00:06:51,665 --> 00:06:53,586
What kind of woman do you want?
Just tell me.

105
00:06:54,003 --> 00:06:56,090
I won't mind,
every woman is just the same

106
00:06:56,174 --> 00:06:57,218
Nothing special

107
00:07:02,939 --> 00:07:04,483
Mr So, what's the matter?

108
00:07:05,277 --> 00:07:06,404
I am attacked.

109
00:07:06,488 --> 00:07:07,155
What? Who dared so?

110
00:07:07,239 --> 00:07:08,868
I will hit that
bastard's mouth for you.

111
00:07:08,951 --> 00:07:09,870
She didn't use her mouth

112
00:07:09,953 --> 00:07:11,039
She used her eyes

113
00:07:11,123 --> 00:07:14,046
Tempting, and I smell blood.
I haven't seen such eyesight before

114
00:07:14,797 --> 00:07:16,676
Who is she?

115
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:18,763
Miss Yushang comes to be part-time
hooker only

116
00:07:18,847 --> 00:07:20,934
Is Mr Chiu interested to sleep with her?

117
00:07:21,018 --> 00:07:22,355
You should ask His Majesty first

118
00:07:22,438 --> 00:07:23,774
How is it? Your Majesty?

119
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,031
We are friends,
just go ahead if you want!

120
00:07:27,114 --> 00:07:28,868
Mr Chiu, help yourself

121
00:07:29,828 --> 00:07:31,164
Thank you then

122
00:07:31,248 --> 00:07:32,208
The room service, please

123
00:07:32,584 --> 00:07:35,590
Yushang, come and greet Mr Chiu

124
00:07:38,805 --> 00:07:39,598
Sister, he is the one we want.

125
00:07:39,724 --> 00:07:41,101
He killed dad.

126
00:07:41,603 --> 00:07:42,480
I know, stay calm.

127
00:07:42,563 --> 00:07:43,231
Let's go.

128
00:07:43,315 --> 00:07:44,234
May I be excused?

129
00:07:44,317 --> 00:07:45,987
Mr Chiu, Miss Yushang has arrived.

130
00:07:48,868 --> 00:07:52,501
How are you, Mr Chiu?

131
00:07:57,636 --> 00:07:58,680
A pretty woman!

132
00:08:00,518 --> 00:08:03,399
Mr Chiu, about tonight…

133
00:08:03,482 --> 00:08:04,609
$100,000

134
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:07,616
if Miss Yushang sleeps with our
young master tonight…

135
00:08:07,699 --> 00:08:09,286
You are not welcome

136
00:08:09,369 --> 00:08:12,166
I am sorry, I am damn sorry

137
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:13,294
Don't you have any objection?

138
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:16,926
Let me say something fair

139
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:18,347
If any of you can offer

140
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:19,724
more than $100,000

141
00:08:19,808 --> 00:08:21,477
Yushang will sleep with whom

142
00:08:21,561 --> 00:08:23,190
Don't quarrel because of such
small amount,

143
00:08:23,273 --> 00:08:24,818
isn't it right?

144
00:08:24,901 --> 00:08:26,571
Pal, you are a big spender

145
00:08:27,991 --> 00:08:29,661
The cheque is too simple to me

146
00:08:31,415 --> 00:08:35,256
I have a pearl which is granted by the
Royal family, it's invaluable!

147
00:08:38,764 --> 00:08:40,476
I love the pearl more

148
00:08:42,396 --> 00:08:45,068
Mr Chiu, I will wait
for you in my room

149
00:08:45,904 --> 00:08:47,616
Does the pearl worth $100,000?

150
00:08:48,534 --> 00:08:50,663
Don't you think that's
too little for you?

151
00:08:50,747 --> 00:08:51,959
I love money too

152
00:08:52,709 --> 00:08:54,213
But, I don't like you

153
00:08:57,929 --> 00:09:00,393
You are frank!
I love it very much

154
00:09:00,476 --> 00:09:01,436
Mr So…

155
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,355
It doesn't matter,

156
00:09:02,438 --> 00:09:04,067
I think, my hat doesn't match me

157
00:09:04,192 --> 00:09:07,240
Yushang doesn't like me,
I deserve it

158
00:09:07,323 --> 00:09:08,535
I am glad you understand this

159
00:09:08,618 --> 00:09:09,495
Don't worry,

160
00:09:09,578 --> 00:09:11,123
I have many pretty girls here

161
00:09:11,207 --> 00:09:14,088
I trust your arrangement

162
00:09:17,052 --> 00:09:18,556
None of my business

163
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:20,016
How bold are you?

164
00:09:29,662 --> 00:09:32,000
Mantis Fist?
It seems to be powerful

165
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:33,043
Music!

166
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:41,645
Keep this

167
00:09:42,856 --> 00:09:43,483
See my Crane's Fists!

168
00:09:43,566 --> 00:09:44,318
The Tiger's Claws!

169
00:09:49,328 --> 00:09:52,251
How can a mantis fight with a tiger?

170
00:09:53,002 --> 00:09:54,631
I know Tiger Claws
and Crane's Fists too!

171
00:09:56,301 --> 00:09:58,055
Well, try me, mantis!

172
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:13,504
Bravo…

173
00:10:13,587 --> 00:10:15,883
Your Tiger's Claws are defeated

174
00:10:18,012 --> 00:10:19,182
Actually it's not Tiger's Claws,

175
00:10:19,266 --> 00:10:20,727
it's beggar's fists!

176
00:10:21,061 --> 00:10:22,230
That's why it's too weak

177
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:29,912
You move fast!

178
00:10:30,247 --> 00:10:31,374
It seems to be powerful…

179
00:10:33,336 --> 00:10:36,217
Kid, you don't know how
the wind blows

180
00:10:43,483 --> 00:10:44,903
The general of
Canton has arrived

181
00:10:44,986 --> 00:10:47,700
Get lost…

182
00:10:48,368 --> 00:10:50,330
Who dares bully my son,
let me teach him a lesson

183
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:51,959
Master

184
00:10:52,043 --> 00:10:53,504
Don't panic, Chan who bullied you?

185
00:10:53,587 --> 00:10:54,506
It's me who bullied others

186
00:10:54,589 --> 00:10:56,093
What? You bullied others?

187
00:10:56,468 --> 00:10:58,305
How much does he have?
Is he qualified to be bullied by you?

188
00:10:58,807 --> 00:10:59,767
Master, they are the ones

189
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:00,310
Who are they?

190
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:01,770
Just take a look

191
00:11:03,984 --> 00:11:05,069
The King of Iron Hat?

192
00:11:08,076 --> 00:11:08,995
Send the gift

193
00:11:09,078 --> 00:11:09,705
Chan

194
00:11:09,788 --> 00:11:11,333
They send you so valuable a present,
you'd stop bullying them

195
00:11:11,834 --> 00:11:12,961
Come on, give tips to the girls here

196
00:11:13,045 --> 00:11:13,754
Master

197
00:11:13,838 --> 00:11:16,093
King of Iron Hat, Seng-ko-lin-ch'in,
is written on the medal

198
00:11:26,824 --> 00:11:28,285
How dare you seize the medal
of His Majesty?

199
00:11:28,786 --> 00:11:29,412
Cuff him

200
00:11:29,495 --> 00:11:31,750
Hold it, according to the Ching's law,

201
00:11:31,834 --> 00:11:34,381
Courtier is not allowed hooking

202
00:11:34,464 --> 00:11:35,883
Now, you are in the brothel

203
00:11:35,968 --> 00:11:38,014
Do you know you have committed
the laws of Ching?

204
00:11:38,514 --> 00:11:39,433
How about you?

205
00:11:40,226 --> 00:11:41,103
- You mean me?
- Yes!

206
00:11:41,187 --> 00:11:43,233
That's right, I come…

207
00:11:43,317 --> 00:11:44,109
- to arrest…
- You!

208
00:11:44,319 --> 00:11:45,863
- Him!
- Arrest him!

209
00:11:46,323 --> 00:11:47,408
I am the general of Canton,

210
00:11:47,491 --> 00:11:49,913
so I should arrest
those bad people

211
00:11:49,997 --> 00:11:51,041
By the way…

212
00:11:51,082 --> 00:11:52,836
What else? Go ahead

213
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:56,385
Today is the birthday of
the ex-Empress Dowager

214
00:11:56,469 --> 00:11:58,640
So your crime is doubled

215
00:11:58,723 --> 00:11:59,851
It may cause capital punishment

216
00:11:59,935 --> 00:12:02,440
Kill him…

217
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:07,909
According to the Ching laws,

218
00:12:07,992 --> 00:12:10,164
anyone without a tail should be killed

219
00:12:10,248 --> 00:12:12,127
So you…

220
00:12:15,007 --> 00:12:16,051
Do you want to see my hair?

221
00:12:16,134 --> 00:12:17,429
You can see as much as you want!
Fat-headed

222
00:12:17,513 --> 00:12:19,892
Cut the crap, just kill him

223
00:12:19,977 --> 00:12:21,898
OK, it's finished

224
00:12:22,231 --> 00:12:24,611
General So, let's play happily together,
so forget it

225
00:12:24,695 --> 00:12:26,031
I haven't played!

226
00:12:26,949 --> 00:12:27,701
Your Majesty,

227
00:12:27,784 --> 00:12:30,039
a rascal has ruined
the atmosphere here,

228
00:12:30,123 --> 00:12:30,958
I should be blamed
for poor arrangement

229
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:32,460
None of your business

230
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:34,172
Let's go

231
00:12:36,343 --> 00:12:39,684
Master, you can't fool this guy
Let's go

232
00:12:40,728 --> 00:12:41,355
OK, go

233
00:12:42,607 --> 00:12:44,569
Just forget the trouble

234
00:12:47,451 --> 00:12:49,747
Young master, your hat

235
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,847
He is great!

236
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:09,873
Uncle Mok, the dishes
are all poisoned

237
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:13,964
Chiu assassinated our Master

238
00:13:14,048 --> 00:13:16,052
and some generals of
the Taiping Reign

239
00:13:16,135 --> 00:13:17,638
And he framed us, the Beggars Association,
to be the assassins

240
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:20,019
Thus made us

241
00:13:20,227 --> 00:13:21,772
being despised by the world

242
00:13:22,691 --> 00:13:24,068
Saying that we became the dogs
of the government

243
00:13:24,611 --> 00:13:26,782
I should ask him to pay for it

244
00:13:28,536 --> 00:13:29,956
His initial power is harmful

245
00:13:30,039 --> 00:13:32,545
Don't take action
until he is trapped

246
00:13:32,628 --> 00:13:35,007
Because we can't defeat him even
if we group together

247
00:13:35,342 --> 00:13:36,886
I will try my best to seduce
him to the bed

248
00:13:38,307 --> 00:13:39,559
Senior, somebody is coming

249
00:13:40,352 --> 00:13:41,396
Get ready…

250
00:13:49,873 --> 00:13:51,334
Miss Yushang, we meet again.

251
00:13:51,417 --> 00:13:53,421
Why do you come here?
Where is Mister Chiu?

252
00:13:53,505 --> 00:13:54,841
The pearl of Mr. Chiu is broken

253
00:13:54,924 --> 00:13:56,886
by Mr. So and become pearl powder

254
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:58,265
I have drunk it.

255
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:00,979
Don't judge Mr. So from his hair,

256
00:14:01,063 --> 00:14:03,359
he is really romantic and funny.

257
00:14:03,777 --> 00:14:04,445
But…

258
00:14:04,528 --> 00:14:06,866
Stop, I have taken his money,
100,000 taels, you know?

259
00:14:06,949 --> 00:14:08,536
I won't give it back.

260
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:10,707
About the personality of Mr. So…

261
00:14:10,791 --> 00:14:12,420
Cut the crap, pimp!

262
00:14:12,503 --> 00:14:13,338
Leave here first.

263
00:14:13,421 --> 00:14:14,423
Yes, you are right.

264
00:14:14,966 --> 00:14:15,551
Miss Seven…

265
00:14:15,635 --> 00:14:17,096
Just accept this.

266
00:14:21,898 --> 00:14:22,900
Who is this guy?

267
00:14:23,401 --> 00:14:24,361
I don't know

268
00:14:24,403 --> 00:14:27,410
Miss, first of all, I have a good
news for you

269
00:14:27,993 --> 00:14:29,330
I love you

270
00:14:30,249 --> 00:14:32,295
To me, this is bad news

271
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:34,548
I know you will reply like this

272
00:14:35,134 --> 00:14:35,927
Cut the crap

273
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:37,179
I wish to pay you 100 pearls

274
00:14:37,263 --> 00:14:40,187
for your company tonight

275
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:41,397
I don't want to talk to you

276
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,524
Please get out

277
00:14:44,403 --> 00:14:45,530
I haven't chosen a wrong one

278
00:14:45,613 --> 00:14:47,535
OK, I will drink this wine first

279
00:14:48,454 --> 00:14:49,456
No…

280
00:14:55,761 --> 00:14:58,015
It surprised me

281
00:14:59,225 --> 00:14:59,810
Miss

282
00:14:59,894 --> 00:15:00,771
Hands off!

283
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:03,944
You know Kung-fu?

284
00:15:04,946 --> 00:15:06,657
No, I don't know Kung-fu at all

285
00:15:07,242 --> 00:15:09,163
I beg you, stop bothering me

286
00:15:09,246 --> 00:15:10,373
I won't accompany you

287
00:15:10,458 --> 00:15:13,004
Yushang, no one treats
me like this

288
00:15:13,672 --> 00:15:15,551
I have found that
I am in love with you

289
00:15:17,305 --> 00:15:18,349
What?

290
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:21,773
I have been in love with you

291
00:15:23,443 --> 00:15:24,570
Are you kidding?

292
00:15:24,946 --> 00:15:27,368
I am not kidding,
I decided to marry you

293
00:15:28,495 --> 00:15:29,580
Are you nuts?

294
00:15:31,292 --> 00:15:32,294
Kidding?

295
00:15:35,092 --> 00:15:36,554
Is there anyone hiding here?

296
00:15:40,145 --> 00:15:42,024
That's good, I want a witness

297
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:43,192
Witness?

298
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:45,782
Yes, I swear in front of your sword

299
00:15:46,408 --> 00:15:48,078
I do want to marry Miss Yushang
as my wife, I am sincere

300
00:15:48,162 --> 00:15:50,333
If I cheat,
I will be killed by thunder

301
00:15:51,626 --> 00:15:53,714
Sister, I feel excited for you

302
00:15:53,798 --> 00:15:54,758
Hey

303
00:15:56,345 --> 00:15:57,681
Don't you know it's not that easy
to be my husband?

304
00:15:58,183 --> 00:15:59,602
How can I be your husband?

305
00:16:01,397 --> 00:16:03,151
I want him to be the superior
Kung-fu master

306
00:16:03,234 --> 00:16:04,486
Be the top of all

307
00:16:04,571 --> 00:16:05,698
Can you do that?

308
00:16:06,658 --> 00:16:07,618
Let me think for one second

309
00:16:14,424 --> 00:16:15,343
I can do it

310
00:16:17,263 --> 00:16:18,182
OK

311
00:16:18,266 --> 00:16:20,771
Do it first and then look for me

312
00:16:21,648 --> 00:16:24,571
Well, I think we should fix a date
for our wedding

313
00:16:24,988 --> 00:16:27,619
Because this is too easy for me
to be the Kung-fu scholar!

314
00:16:28,579 --> 00:16:32,128
OK, but you'd give me some time
to consider it.

315
00:16:32,212 --> 00:16:34,717
No problem, I will wait for your answer
outside the garden

316
00:16:35,678 --> 00:16:36,889
I won't leave until seeing you

317
00:16:41,021 --> 00:16:42,483
Crazy!

318
00:17:05,489 --> 00:17:08,120
We come for the Beggars Association,
those unrelated persons leave at once

319
00:18:05,239 --> 00:18:07,995
Sir, the timing is right

320
00:18:08,496 --> 00:18:10,375
The road is safe now, please go

321
00:18:11,336 --> 00:18:14,467
Good, very good

322
00:18:17,014 --> 00:18:17,891
Let's go!

323
00:18:30,459 --> 00:18:32,922
Shit, we are late

324
00:18:34,258 --> 00:18:35,845
That Manchurian should be blamed

325
00:18:42,859 --> 00:18:44,696
Sister…

326
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:45,532
What's the matter?

327
00:18:45,657 --> 00:18:46,827
The idiot is still there

328
00:18:47,369 --> 00:18:48,079
Let's kill him

329
00:18:48,287 --> 00:18:50,626
Forget it,
he doesn't mean to bother us

330
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:52,004
Let him go

331
00:19:04,238 --> 00:19:05,866
Are you fond of him?

332
00:19:06,409 --> 00:19:07,453
What did you say?

333
00:19:07,536 --> 00:19:08,914
I won't fall in love with anybody

334
00:19:08,998 --> 00:19:11,127
until Chiu is killed

335
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:12,421
Especially him

336
00:19:13,214 --> 00:19:14,968
Chiu is good at Kung-fu

337
00:19:15,052 --> 00:19:18,393
Mok said, we can't defeat him unless
using the “Dragon Killing Palms”

338
00:19:19,478 --> 00:19:20,773
So, I can never marry!

339
00:19:21,315 --> 00:19:23,319
Let's go, if you want to marry

340
00:19:42,067 --> 00:19:44,154
What evil are you?
How dare you scare me?

341
00:19:45,198 --> 00:19:47,995
Mr So, it's me!

342
00:19:50,084 --> 00:19:51,044
You are the pimp?!

343
00:19:51,128 --> 00:19:52,464
Yes!

344
00:19:52,547 --> 00:19:54,176
You have a flat figure,
where are your busts?

345
00:19:54,259 --> 00:19:57,140
It's early in the morning,
they haven't woken up yet

346
00:19:57,683 --> 00:19:59,228
It's lucky of you
for not being killed

347
00:19:59,311 --> 00:20:01,023
Don't go around if you haven't
made up yet

348
00:20:01,107 --> 00:20:02,192
I won't do it again

349
00:20:02,986 --> 00:20:06,827
Stop waiting for Miss Yushang,
she left

350
00:20:07,746 --> 00:20:08,623
What?

351
00:20:12,881 --> 00:20:14,343
Where is she going?

352
00:20:15,136 --> 00:20:18,935
She… she is going to Peking

353
00:20:19,645 --> 00:20:20,647
Peking?

354
00:20:21,274 --> 00:20:25,909
Men should contribute to the country

355
00:20:25,992 --> 00:20:30,000
Where should I put my pigtail?

356
00:20:30,084 --> 00:20:32,088
Swing and swing…

357
00:20:32,171 --> 00:20:34,176
I pull it and play it…

358
00:20:34,259 --> 00:20:35,511
Dad!

359
00:20:36,347 --> 00:20:37,934
I decided to join the examination for the
scholar of Martial Arts

360
00:20:38,267 --> 00:20:39,645
Chan

361
00:20:40,188 --> 00:20:42,318
I have been longing for this word
for 25 years

362
00:20:42,401 --> 00:20:44,155
For the family of us, you should do that

363
00:20:44,239 --> 00:20:46,410
Don't misunderstand it,
I do it not for no one

364
00:20:46,493 --> 00:20:47,286
But for a woman

365
00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:48,539
What a hero!

366
00:20:48,915 --> 00:20:51,086
For a girl, you want to be the scholar
of Martial Arts!

367
00:20:51,211 --> 00:20:52,171
Who is that girl?

368
00:20:52,255 --> 00:20:54,510
The hooker of Yee Hung Brothel,
Miss Yushang

369
00:20:54,593 --> 00:20:55,762
For a hooker?

370
00:20:57,307 --> 00:20:58,309
What's wrong with it?

371
00:20:59,061 --> 00:21:01,733
You have different taste,
you are great!

372
00:21:01,817 --> 00:21:03,028
I am admiring you!

373
00:21:03,111 --> 00:21:04,113
I will accompany you to Peking

374
00:21:04,196 --> 00:21:05,408
2, 3, 4, 5, 6

375
00:21:05,491 --> 00:21:07,787
I am coming

376
00:21:07,871 --> 00:21:10,293
Young master is going for the examination,
let's move to Peking too

377
00:21:12,673 --> 00:21:13,967
Stop chasing,

378
00:21:14,050 --> 00:21:16,305
we won't take the hens with us

379
00:21:16,389 --> 00:21:19,897
Be careful!

380
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:22,401
If you break my stuff,
I will teach you a good lesson

381
00:21:23,028 --> 00:21:23,988
Be careful!

382
00:21:25,032 --> 00:21:25,784
Good morning dad

383
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:26,452
Good morning

384
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:27,412
You want to move
everything to Peking?

385
00:21:27,496 --> 00:21:28,248
Sure

386
00:21:28,331 --> 00:21:30,001
Please leave me a cloth

387
00:21:30,084 --> 00:21:31,796
You are only a kid,
you don't need this

388
00:21:32,214 --> 00:21:33,174
But I am not small

389
00:21:34,761 --> 00:21:37,099
Are you bigger than mine?

390
00:21:37,391 --> 00:21:38,184
You despise me!

391
00:21:38,268 --> 00:21:39,270
Mine will be bigger
than yours one day

392
00:21:39,354 --> 00:21:42,235
Let's find something,
say trousers to cover it

393
00:21:42,693 --> 00:21:43,528
I don't want to see it

394
00:21:43,612 --> 00:21:46,368
Why are you standing here for?
Why don't you remove it?

395
00:21:47,788 --> 00:21:49,417
It's a hard job to remove
such a big house!

396
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,295
Please, work hard men!

397
00:21:51,379 --> 00:21:55,178
Ready, 1, 2, 3, push!

398
00:21:55,554 --> 00:21:59,145
Push!

399
00:21:59,228 --> 00:22:00,356
Be careful!

400
00:22:00,731 --> 00:22:02,318
Tie it well…

401
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,654
Master, do you want to
move the tree too?

402
00:22:03,737 --> 00:22:04,782
Sure,

403
00:22:04,866 --> 00:22:06,870
or how can I eat Lychee in Peking?

404
00:22:07,538 --> 00:22:08,957
Push it over…

405
00:22:10,126 --> 00:22:13,216
Be careful

406
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:15,931
Take care of my Lychee,
you fathead!

407
00:22:17,016 --> 00:22:19,145
Chiu helped me to terminate

408
00:22:19,228 --> 00:22:23,571
the Hairy Gang in Kwangsi

409
00:22:23,654 --> 00:22:26,451
So I bring him here
to greet Your Majesty

410
00:22:27,621 --> 00:22:32,257
Fine, I am now appointing you to be
the Deputy Secretary

411
00:22:33,675 --> 00:22:36,681
Hope you will serve our Ching Dynasty
whole-heartedly

412
00:22:37,308 --> 00:22:38,393
Thank you, Your Majesty

413
00:22:38,644 --> 00:22:41,734
Your Majesty, Mr Chiu is a magician

414
00:22:42,193 --> 00:22:45,117
Why don't you ask him to
show you something?

415
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,411
Magic?

416
00:22:48,748 --> 00:22:51,462
Mr Chiu, then show me your magic

417
00:22:51,588 --> 00:22:52,882
Yes, Your Majesty

418
00:25:08,874 --> 00:25:10,002
There is nothing surprising, go

419
00:25:10,128 --> 00:25:11,088
Yes

420
00:25:24,658 --> 00:25:27,581
I am sorry for scaring you

421
00:25:28,039 --> 00:25:30,253
If this girl is real,
that's fantastic!

422
00:25:32,299 --> 00:25:33,635
Hurry up!

423
00:25:34,052 --> 00:25:36,599
What's the matter?

424
00:25:36,683 --> 00:25:39,689
Come on, go in

425
00:25:40,649 --> 00:25:41,651
What's the matter?

426
00:25:41,735 --> 00:25:44,867
Hide in here

427
00:25:46,954 --> 00:25:47,789
Get ready, young master

428
00:25:48,958 --> 00:25:49,835
Come on

429
00:25:50,837 --> 00:25:52,341
Freeze, don't move

430
00:25:57,434 --> 00:26:00,483
Sweet smell, are you Piu Hung?

431
00:26:00,566 --> 00:26:02,862
You are great!
I love it.

432
00:26:03,864 --> 00:26:05,034
Closer

433
00:26:06,036 --> 00:26:08,290
So big!
You must be Small!

434
00:26:08,708 --> 00:26:11,505
You are bad, how can
you say that to me?

435
00:26:11,589 --> 00:26:12,466
You are big!

436
00:26:15,055 --> 00:26:17,560
What? Pregnant woman?
You can't cheat me

437
00:26:17,643 --> 00:26:18,562
You are Dad

438
00:26:18,645 --> 00:26:21,861
How bad are you,
how can you guess that?

439
00:26:21,944 --> 00:26:23,281
Good boy

440
00:26:23,364 --> 00:26:27,497
I wanted to trick you actually,
you are really smart.

441
00:26:28,708 --> 00:26:31,255
Young master has to join
the examination tomorrow,

442
00:26:31,338 --> 00:26:32,131
stop playing

443
00:26:32,215 --> 00:26:33,385
Get out…

444
00:26:34,554 --> 00:26:36,558
Chan, have you prepared

445
00:26:36,641 --> 00:26:37,893
for your examination?

446
00:26:37,978 --> 00:26:40,524
What should I prepare?
I must win, don't you know that?

447
00:26:40,649 --> 00:26:41,735
Yes I do!

448
00:26:42,821 --> 00:26:45,117
I have faith in you from seeing
your behaviour!

449
00:26:45,785 --> 00:26:47,747
Chan, this is Uncle Cheng

450
00:26:47,831 --> 00:26:49,126
He will be the examiner

451
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:50,379
Say hello to Uncle Cheng

452
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:53,426
How are you, Uncle Cheng?

453
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:57,811
See

454
00:26:57,894 --> 00:27:00,149
Doesn't he seem to be the winner?

455
00:27:01,318 --> 00:27:02,320
It depends on the fate

456
00:27:03,405 --> 00:27:05,409
Cheng, I've asked someone

457
00:27:05,786 --> 00:27:07,122
to finish the papers
which you gave me

458
00:27:07,498 --> 00:27:08,333
Will the questions be changed?

459
00:27:09,042 --> 00:27:10,712
Don't worry about
the question paper

460
00:27:11,005 --> 00:27:12,257
But about the test
of arrows shooting,

461
00:27:12,341 --> 00:27:13,970
riding, boxing and weapons…

462
00:27:14,053 --> 00:27:15,430
He should try his best

463
00:27:15,515 --> 00:27:16,475
Don't worry

464
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:18,772
My son is keen in martial arts

465
00:27:18,855 --> 00:27:22,196
So, can I deduct some from the payment
of 2 million taels?

466
00:27:22,279 --> 00:27:24,743
We are friends,
but that is business

467
00:27:32,258 --> 00:27:36,266
Let the Horse teams
be the pioneer

468
00:27:36,349 --> 00:27:38,855
The arrows teams go sideways,
the gunmen stay back

469
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:15,306
The candidates come in

470
00:29:10,254 --> 00:29:11,214
I can't lift it

471
00:29:14,054 --> 00:29:14,973
I don't want to waste my force

472
00:29:15,056 --> 00:29:17,520
Shameless? Damn you!

473
00:29:45,327 --> 00:29:46,831
Oh, 10 marks

474
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:14,389
The final race now starts

475
00:31:15,641 --> 00:31:16,769
The candidates,

476
00:31:16,852 --> 00:31:19,023
Po Ye Tat Tor from Mongolia

477
00:31:19,483 --> 00:31:23,157
Bravo…

478
00:31:23,241 --> 00:31:25,620
And So Cha Ha Yee
Chan from Canton

479
00:31:29,044 --> 00:31:30,088
Last call

480
00:31:30,171 --> 00:31:33,178
So, one to ten
Po, one to one

481
00:31:34,097 --> 00:31:37,353
Are you kidding, how can the betting rates
differ so much?

482
00:31:37,771 --> 00:31:40,025
One to ten for Chan? Kidding?

483
00:31:40,485 --> 00:31:42,071
Why don't you have
faith in Chan?

484
00:31:42,196 --> 00:31:46,539
That is, Chan defaulted
in weight lifting

485
00:31:46,622 --> 00:31:49,879
Look, Po entered the final race

486
00:31:49,963 --> 00:31:52,677
with full marks, it differs

487
00:31:52,844 --> 00:31:55,933
It's an examination of the Scholar
of Martial Arts, not king of coolie

488
00:31:56,435 --> 00:31:57,980
It's meaningless to be the champion
of weight lifting

489
00:31:58,063 --> 00:31:59,524
You shouldn't put it that way

490
00:31:59,608 --> 00:32:00,653
What?

491
00:32:00,736 --> 00:32:02,072
He is smart

492
00:32:02,155 --> 00:32:04,369
I've studied this
race for a long time

493
00:32:04,452 --> 00:32:06,081
I feel strange about the rate too

494
00:32:06,164 --> 00:32:10,005
Po is smart and strong

495
00:32:10,088 --> 00:32:12,760
But see the sweat of his neck

496
00:32:12,844 --> 00:32:15,266
I think it's because
he is getting tired

497
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:16,059
Really?

498
00:32:17,061 --> 00:32:18,356
But this So

499
00:32:18,439 --> 00:32:19,358
What do you think?

500
00:32:19,441 --> 00:32:20,693
He has been disappointing
the audience

501
00:32:20,778 --> 00:32:23,659
But he has achieved very hard

502
00:32:23,784 --> 00:32:25,203
What?

503
00:32:25,286 --> 00:32:28,752
He tried very hard

504
00:32:28,877 --> 00:32:31,674
So I want to bet on him

505
00:32:31,759 --> 00:32:33,553
How much do you want to bet?

506
00:32:34,097 --> 00:32:35,391
800,000 taels

507
00:32:35,475 --> 00:32:38,021
Why not 2 million taels?

508
00:32:38,105 --> 00:32:40,402
What? Why are you so optimistic
about Chan?

509
00:32:40,485 --> 00:32:42,030
You have good analysis

510
00:32:42,114 --> 00:32:42,782
I feel Chan

511
00:32:42,865 --> 00:32:44,869
will be the champion

512
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:47,459
Come on

513
00:32:48,627 --> 00:32:49,546
I want to bet more on him

514
00:32:49,629 --> 00:32:50,297
Really?

515
00:32:50,423 --> 00:32:51,216
2 million taels!

516
00:32:52,176 --> 00:32:53,303
How generous!

517
00:32:54,097 --> 00:32:55,601
Why don't you bet?

518
00:32:55,893 --> 00:32:58,106
Why should I bet?
He is my son

519
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:02,656
Shit, I miss one thing out
of my calculation

520
00:33:03,074 --> 00:33:03,909
What?

521
00:33:03,993 --> 00:33:04,953
The blood

522
00:33:07,124 --> 00:33:09,086
Here comes the Examiner

523
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:13,262
What? Isn't Cheng the examiner?

524
00:33:17,772 --> 00:33:18,774
Please take a seat

525
00:33:21,571 --> 00:33:22,615
Seng-ko-lin-ch'in?!

526
00:33:23,116 --> 00:33:23,950
What's the problem?

527
00:33:25,287 --> 00:33:27,709
He is the uncle of Po

528
00:33:29,922 --> 00:33:31,174
Let's start

529
00:33:35,684 --> 00:33:36,937
Start!

530
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,587
Bravo…

531
00:34:09,964 --> 00:34:12,887
They should add 2 more marks for that
powerful shot

532
00:34:12,970 --> 00:34:14,724
I do think so

533
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:21,488
So's arrow isn't on the target,
Po won this section

534
00:34:28,252 --> 00:34:30,798
Kidding? Damn you!
They are cheating

535
00:34:35,183 --> 00:34:37,397
The candidates please
get on the horses

536
00:34:40,486 --> 00:34:41,446
Mr Chiu

537
00:34:45,538 --> 00:34:48,169
Take these with you, maybe you will
find them useful

538
00:34:48,837 --> 00:34:51,343
Here comes the 2nd round

539
00:35:21,781 --> 00:35:23,117
They trick again.

540
00:35:24,035 --> 00:35:27,000
It's corrupt!
May I give up the betting?

541
00:35:51,551 --> 00:35:52,929
Chan won this race

542
00:35:53,431 --> 00:35:54,475
Did you tear the ticket?

543
00:35:54,558 --> 00:35:55,852
Not yet

544
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:10,507
Are you kidding?

545
00:37:12,345 --> 00:37:13,722
Once again?!

546
00:37:19,819 --> 00:37:21,614
OK, let's start from the very beginning,
I'll fight with a single hand and leg

547
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:23,117
I won't take your advantage

548
00:37:34,308 --> 00:37:36,019
How can you use
such a dirty stance?

549
00:37:36,103 --> 00:37:37,731
Have you woken?

550
00:37:38,524 --> 00:37:40,111
Bravo! He won

551
00:37:40,195 --> 00:37:42,116
Have some tea

552
00:37:42,199 --> 00:37:43,411
All the best!

553
00:37:43,911 --> 00:37:45,456
What did

554
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:46,292
you say?

555
00:37:46,375 --> 00:37:48,170
It's English

556
00:37:48,254 --> 00:37:49,256
It's English

557
00:37:49,798 --> 00:37:51,260
There is no regulation stating that
weapons are not allowed

558
00:37:51,678 --> 00:37:54,976
You fell down first,
Po is the winner again

559
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:00,112
Damn you Cheng!

560
00:38:00,279 --> 00:38:02,116
You betrayed me!

561
00:38:02,199 --> 00:38:03,577
I will beat you to death

562
00:38:03,661 --> 00:38:04,663
if I see you again

563
00:38:05,330 --> 00:38:06,834
Forget it, you won't
see him anymore

564
00:38:06,917 --> 00:38:07,669
Why?

565
00:38:07,752 --> 00:38:08,629
I am now going to kill him!

566
00:38:08,713 --> 00:38:09,590
I don't have 2 million to lose!

567
00:38:11,677 --> 00:38:12,721
Just kidding

568
00:38:13,139 --> 00:38:14,224
You shameless

569
00:38:14,474 --> 00:38:18,858
Po is the Scholar of Martial Arts

570
00:38:19,402 --> 00:38:21,531
I did win! Objection

571
00:38:39,653 --> 00:38:40,697
What are you doing?

572
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:44,371
The dart is poisoned

573
00:38:46,291 --> 00:38:48,170
He deserves it!

574
00:38:51,636 --> 00:38:53,390
He was poisoned by his own dart

575
00:38:54,016 --> 00:38:56,604
Well, my son will
be the Scholar then

576
00:38:56,729 --> 00:38:57,648
I am going to be rich!

577
00:38:57,774 --> 00:38:58,985
Yes!

578
00:39:08,045 --> 00:39:10,174
Thank you, my ancestors!

579
00:39:10,258 --> 00:39:11,428
You have good judgement

580
00:39:14,267 --> 00:39:16,271
Sir, His Majesty wants to appoint
the title himself

581
00:39:24,246 --> 00:39:28,212
I want to take some statements
from you as record

582
00:39:28,338 --> 00:39:30,927
You won this time, who are you
going to thank?

583
00:39:31,010 --> 00:39:32,179
Miss Yushang!

584
00:39:33,474 --> 00:39:36,355
Is Miss Yushang your mom?

585
00:39:41,073 --> 00:39:43,579
Long life to you!

586
00:39:44,162 --> 00:39:44,830
Please get up

587
00:39:44,914 --> 00:39:45,958
Thank you

588
00:39:47,878 --> 00:39:50,592
Who is the new Scholar
of Martial Arts?

589
00:39:52,847 --> 00:39:55,895
Your Majesty, So Chan from Canton
is the Scholar this year

590
00:39:59,194 --> 00:40:01,365
Your Majesty,
I am So Cha Ha Yee Chan

591
00:40:03,912 --> 00:40:05,582
Your Majesty,
I want to report something

592
00:40:08,505 --> 00:40:09,257
Go ahead

593
00:40:11,052 --> 00:40:13,056
I have found that
So is illiterate

594
00:40:13,515 --> 00:40:15,144
So how could he answer the
question paper of strategy?

595
00:40:15,227 --> 00:40:16,229
That should be tricks

596
00:40:20,947 --> 00:40:22,075
Take the stationery out!

597
00:40:22,159 --> 00:40:23,161
Yes

598
00:40:28,129 --> 00:40:31,428
So Cha Ha Yee Chan,
write your name now

599
00:40:33,515 --> 00:40:35,895
Thank God, he knows how to
write his name!

600
00:40:35,979 --> 00:40:37,649
He can write his name!

601
00:40:51,094 --> 00:40:51,887
I don't know how to write

602
00:40:53,891 --> 00:40:55,019
That's shit!

603
00:40:56,021 --> 00:40:56,981
Kill him now

604
00:40:57,565 --> 00:40:58,735
No! No!

605
00:41:00,948 --> 00:41:02,284
Your Majesty,
I am the one who cheated

606
00:41:02,368 --> 00:41:03,245
It's none of his business

607
00:41:03,328 --> 00:41:04,288
Just chop me to death

608
00:41:04,372 --> 00:41:05,583
No, you should kill me

609
00:41:05,749 --> 00:41:06,417
Sorry dad

610
00:41:06,501 --> 00:41:07,586
I don't know how to write my name

611
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:08,756
Stop, I have known it already

612
00:41:08,881 --> 00:41:10,342
Your Majesty, I should be killed

613
00:41:10,467 --> 00:41:11,052
Kill me

614
00:41:11,136 --> 00:41:11,929
No, kill me

615
00:41:12,012 --> 00:41:12,722
Kill me

616
00:41:12,806 --> 00:41:13,516
Your Majesty, you'd better kill me

617
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:15,728
Shit, are you giving order?

618
00:41:16,313 --> 00:41:17,565
You two cooperated to cheat me

619
00:41:18,276 --> 00:41:19,988
The Secretary for Justice,
announce the penalty for them

620
00:41:20,948 --> 00:41:24,246
Come out! Hurry up

621
00:41:24,873 --> 00:41:26,794
I am here!

622
00:41:30,886 --> 00:41:31,888
He is the Secretary for Justice

623
00:41:32,555 --> 00:41:34,894
So's family should be

624
00:41:34,977 --> 00:41:36,355
sentenced to death

625
00:41:38,318 --> 00:41:40,907
But their ancestors achieved a lot
to Ching, they can be exempted

626
00:41:40,990 --> 00:41:44,121
But, their fortune should be forfeited

627
00:41:44,915 --> 00:41:45,959
Have you carried out any military duty?

628
00:41:46,543 --> 00:41:48,672
I haven't gone back to my camp for
7 years, I haven't done anything

629
00:41:50,134 --> 00:41:52,639
So, he didn't miscarry any duty

630
00:41:54,267 --> 00:41:54,769
So, the maximum penalty

631
00:41:54,852 --> 00:41:57,566
is forfeiture of property only

632
00:42:01,366 --> 00:42:03,120
What? Are you sure?

633
00:42:03,871 --> 00:42:05,499
I am fair

634
00:42:05,625 --> 00:42:07,963
I judge it from the Law Book

635
00:42:09,591 --> 00:42:11,052
Can I add something?

636
00:42:11,929 --> 00:42:14,601
Sure, since you are the Emperor

637
00:42:15,019 --> 00:42:17,733
I want them to be beggars for the rest
of their lives

638
00:42:18,276 --> 00:42:20,448
Why couldn't you find out they cheated during the examination?

639
00:42:20,990 --> 00:42:22,202
Luckily Chiu reported
it to me on time

640
00:42:22,285 --> 00:42:25,208
Chiu, you would be rewarded

641
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:31,679
I am wandering…

642
00:42:31,762 --> 00:42:34,059
That's the spirit tablet of my dad,
do you want to take it too?

643
00:42:36,147 --> 00:42:38,068
It's useless for you

644
00:42:38,151 --> 00:42:48,422
How poor are we…

645
00:42:48,505 --> 00:42:54,893
I am thinking of my better half…

646
00:42:54,977 --> 00:42:55,979
Young master,

647
00:42:56,731 --> 00:42:57,859
from now on,

648
00:42:57,943 --> 00:42:59,947
you'd be hard working to learn
how to write

649
00:43:03,996 --> 00:43:10,844
But I can't sell the affection…

650
00:43:14,309 --> 00:43:15,228
Professor

651
00:43:16,773 --> 00:43:17,775
I will learn it

652
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:23,496
I regret that…

653
00:43:24,038 --> 00:43:26,710
Master, I will take good care of
Little Turtle

654
00:43:26,877 --> 00:43:28,130
I am sorry

655
00:43:28,214 --> 00:43:30,802
We haven't given birth to any
baby of yours

656
00:43:30,886 --> 00:43:32,138
It doesn't matter

657
00:43:32,222 --> 00:43:34,226
It's all my fault

658
00:43:34,393 --> 00:43:35,186
If I did better,

659
00:43:35,270 --> 00:43:37,191
you could have many babies

660
00:43:37,275 --> 00:43:37,984
But I think

661
00:43:38,109 --> 00:43:40,031
Chan is enough for me

662
00:43:41,283 --> 00:43:42,452
Why are you standing here?
Go now

663
00:43:42,577 --> 00:43:44,122
Master, we are leaving

664
00:43:44,205 --> 00:43:45,249
We are leaving, master

665
00:43:45,333 --> 00:43:46,545
Go, go now

666
00:43:49,258 --> 00:43:50,260
We are free

667
00:43:50,844 --> 00:43:52,806
I feel so happy

668
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:56,899
How happy are we!

669
00:43:57,484 --> 00:43:58,736
Go in…

670
00:43:58,819 --> 00:44:00,030
Hurry up…

671
00:44:00,113 --> 00:44:01,283
How is it?

672
00:44:02,285 --> 00:44:03,830
Why are they so happy?

673
00:44:03,914 --> 00:44:05,083
What happened?

674
00:44:05,124 --> 00:44:07,003
I am very happy

675
00:44:07,546 --> 00:44:09,049
Please go in…

676
00:44:09,132 --> 00:44:10,134
Welcome…

677
00:44:11,095 --> 00:44:14,269
Damn sequestration,
I wanna cry, my son

678
00:44:14,352 --> 00:44:16,481
Hold it, don't lose our face

679
00:44:16,564 --> 00:44:17,566
Keep on laughing

680
00:44:19,237 --> 00:44:21,409
Son

681
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:22,786
Have you kept any money?

682
00:44:22,869 --> 00:44:24,081
No, how about you?

683
00:44:24,164 --> 00:44:25,583
I forgot that

684
00:44:28,214 --> 00:44:31,638
Shit, damn sequestration!

685
00:44:33,934 --> 00:44:37,608
Be merciful,

686
00:44:38,152 --> 00:44:39,614
please give money to us

687
00:44:39,697 --> 00:44:41,451
Son, that guy is like dad

688
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:43,204
You mean the one who sings?

689
00:44:43,621 --> 00:44:45,500
No, the one who pays

690
00:44:45,584 --> 00:44:48,048
He is more disgusting
than the one who sings

691
00:44:48,131 --> 00:44:50,720
Not exactly, he is smart

692
00:44:52,222 --> 00:44:53,307
Dad should be blamed

693
00:44:53,392 --> 00:44:55,145
I always called you beggar

694
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:56,607
Now, it becomes true

695
00:44:56,690 --> 00:44:57,650
What's wrong with you?

696
00:44:57,734 --> 00:44:58,987
The emperor wants
us to be beggars

697
00:44:59,112 --> 00:45:00,448
Do you think we'd be beggars?

698
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:02,578
I am smart, I am keen
in kung-fu fighting

699
00:45:02,661 --> 00:45:04,456
Even the Gods won't
let me be beggars

700
00:45:04,540 --> 00:45:05,500
That's true

701
00:45:05,584 --> 00:45:06,419
Am I like beggar?

702
00:45:06,503 --> 00:45:07,505
No

703
00:45:08,256 --> 00:45:10,135
Buy something to eat, you beggars

704
00:45:12,264 --> 00:45:14,310
You treat us as beggars?

705
00:45:14,394 --> 00:45:16,189
Damn you!

706
00:45:16,273 --> 00:45:18,694
It's weird! Let's eat

707
00:45:22,202 --> 00:45:24,164
Chan, since we have
nothing to do

708
00:45:24,248 --> 00:45:25,585
Let me take a seat,

709
00:45:25,710 --> 00:45:27,129
maybe we can have something
to eat tonight

710
00:45:27,212 --> 00:45:28,590
You are treating
yourself a beggar?

711
00:45:29,175 --> 00:45:30,260
Dad, don't worry

712
00:45:30,302 --> 00:45:32,056
I need no begging for money

713
00:45:32,140 --> 00:45:33,309
How can you get money
if you don't beg?

714
00:45:33,392 --> 00:45:34,311
Just ask someone
to give us money

715
00:45:34,477 --> 00:45:36,022
Pal, may I know your name?

716
00:45:37,233 --> 00:45:38,068
Nau Tai Chung

717
00:45:38,152 --> 00:45:39,280
Do you have money?

718
00:45:39,363 --> 00:45:40,115
Yes

719
00:45:40,198 --> 00:45:41,075
Just give it to me

720
00:45:41,159 --> 00:45:41,868
OK

721
00:45:46,503 --> 00:45:47,295
Thank you

722
00:45:47,337 --> 00:45:49,342
Why should I give you money?

723
00:45:50,051 --> 00:45:51,096
Why do you ask so many questions?

724
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:52,516
But I should know the reason

725
00:45:52,599 --> 00:45:54,645
Anyway, you should pay it

726
00:45:54,728 --> 00:45:56,775
No, let's fix it up first

727
00:45:59,237 --> 00:46:00,615
Just give it to us, why are you
asking so much?

728
00:46:00,699 --> 00:46:01,409
Hands off

729
00:46:01,493 --> 00:46:02,328
You mean robbing?

730
00:46:02,369 --> 00:46:03,830
Robbery…

731
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,712
I am not robbing, I am begging

732
00:46:06,796 --> 00:46:10,637
Begging? How dare you, you beggar,
you are cheating me!

733
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:13,809
Don't you think I am stupid?
I am smart, you know?

734
00:46:13,893 --> 00:46:14,938
Hey, two days passed,

735
00:46:15,021 --> 00:46:16,900
It's cold and I am hungry now

736
00:46:16,983 --> 00:46:18,737
Have you had any ideas?

737
00:46:19,113 --> 00:46:19,990
I have a friend's girlfriend

738
00:46:20,407 --> 00:46:22,912
who is living in Peking

739
00:46:24,207 --> 00:46:26,128
She always admires you

740
00:46:26,211 --> 00:46:27,380
Really?

741
00:46:27,421 --> 00:46:30,385
Yes, if you are
willing to date her

742
00:46:30,427 --> 00:46:32,974
I think she will help us to
go back to Canton

743
00:46:33,058 --> 00:46:35,522
But, you have to sacrifice

744
00:46:35,605 --> 00:46:36,774
Do you mean…

745
00:46:36,858 --> 00:46:39,322
For our family,
just as you said

746
00:46:39,405 --> 00:46:41,159
I know it's very hard for you

747
00:46:41,242 --> 00:46:42,369
Cut the crap,
let's go and find her

748
00:46:42,454 --> 00:46:43,456
I have arranged it

749
00:46:44,081 --> 00:46:46,545
The one wearing the red dress who stands
under the lantern, that's her

750
00:46:52,892 --> 00:46:53,894
Ghost!

751
00:46:59,363 --> 00:47:00,198
It's a benefit for you!

752
00:47:00,282 --> 00:47:02,411
Why don't you go yourself?

753
00:47:16,650 --> 00:47:18,571
Chan, I haven't tried this before

754
00:47:18,654 --> 00:47:19,489
Be careful!

755
00:47:19,572 --> 00:47:20,866
Don't worry

756
00:47:20,951 --> 00:47:21,785
I'll take care of you

757
00:47:21,869 --> 00:47:23,538
You want to earn money for
shark-fins, right?

758
00:47:23,622 --> 00:47:24,499
Right…

759
00:47:26,546 --> 00:47:29,510
Get lost…

760
00:47:29,635 --> 00:47:30,846
No show here

761
00:47:34,562 --> 00:47:36,483
We just want to earn some money

762
00:47:36,567 --> 00:47:37,569
to go back to Canton

763
00:47:38,027 --> 00:47:40,533
Don't be that mean to us

764
00:47:42,704 --> 00:47:43,664
It's the Royal instruction that

765
00:47:43,999 --> 00:47:46,378
the So's family'd
be beggars for life

766
00:47:46,503 --> 00:47:48,550
You two can only be beggars

767
00:47:49,050 --> 00:47:51,264
I am carrying my duty only.
Men!

768
00:47:51,389 --> 00:47:52,015
Yes!

769
00:47:52,099 --> 00:47:52,891
Remove all the things

770
00:47:52,975 --> 00:47:53,978
Yes

771
00:47:56,859 --> 00:47:58,153
Help!

772
00:47:58,194 --> 00:48:00,115
Master Chiu, it's hard
for one to carry it

773
00:48:00,198 --> 00:48:02,870
Ask more men to remove it

774
00:48:02,954 --> 00:48:03,999
Yes

775
00:48:06,545 --> 00:48:07,380
What do you want?

776
00:48:07,464 --> 00:48:08,424
No, we can't move it

777
00:48:08,507 --> 00:48:09,175
Let me do it

778
00:48:09,259 --> 00:48:10,136
You want a fight, don't you?

779
00:48:11,473 --> 00:48:12,976
Last time you could escape from
Yee Hung Hostel

780
00:48:13,393 --> 00:48:14,812
But you won't be
that lucky this time

781
00:48:19,364 --> 00:48:20,283
He is powerful!

782
00:48:20,366 --> 00:48:21,326
I've got to defeat him

783
00:48:21,410 --> 00:48:22,829
by one powerful strike

784
00:48:22,913 --> 00:48:24,875
I can't give him another chance
to counterattack

785
00:48:46,044 --> 00:48:49,510
Chan…

786
00:48:49,594 --> 00:48:51,766
Chan…

787
00:48:51,849 --> 00:48:53,686
Your legs and hands

788
00:48:53,811 --> 00:48:54,938
are all broken by me

789
00:48:56,107 --> 00:48:57,694
You will be a cripple for the
rest of your life

790
00:48:59,865 --> 00:49:02,162
You want to fight? Not now!

791
00:49:02,997 --> 00:49:05,961
But, you can beg for money

792
00:49:06,713 --> 00:49:07,840
Be a good beggar

793
00:49:09,719 --> 00:49:13,602
Go, go away…

794
00:49:21,995 --> 00:49:25,711
Don't panic, Chan, it's OK

795
00:49:27,005 --> 00:49:33,143
Don't panic, you'll be
all right… Chan!

796
00:49:34,772 --> 00:49:37,820
I went to the examination hall

797
00:49:37,987 --> 00:49:39,699
with my son,

798
00:49:39,782 --> 00:49:41,786
don't you know who
was the examiner?

799
00:49:41,828 --> 00:49:44,625
He is Seng-ko-lin-ch'in,
that bastard.

800
00:49:44,709 --> 00:49:47,799
He was the enemy of us!

801
00:49:48,133 --> 00:49:49,637
About our story…

802
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:51,223
Let me stop here first,
I want a smoke.

803
00:49:52,851 --> 00:49:54,688
It's better to smoke now.

804
00:49:54,771 --> 00:49:56,566
Yes, it's better.

805
00:49:56,650 --> 00:49:59,991
We let him go in

806
00:50:00,074 --> 00:50:01,995
the Yee Hung Brothel.

807
00:50:02,078 --> 00:50:03,999
But he framed us in return.

808
00:50:04,083 --> 00:50:06,170
He tricked my son

809
00:50:06,254 --> 00:50:08,550
during the examination.

810
00:50:08,633 --> 00:50:11,849
But, my son was really
smart and great

811
00:50:11,891 --> 00:50:13,978
He finally won the race

812
00:50:14,062 --> 00:50:14,981
To be the greatest Kung-fu
fighter, invincible

813
00:50:15,064 --> 00:50:16,944
Be the top

814
00:50:17,027 --> 00:50:18,822
Can you do that?

815
00:50:18,906 --> 00:50:19,866
Sure!

816
00:50:19,908 --> 00:50:20,910
Well

817
00:50:21,285 --> 00:50:23,749
Come back to me
if you can do that

818
00:50:25,419 --> 00:50:27,256
I think we should fix our
wedding date first

819
00:50:27,340 --> 00:50:30,263
Because being the scholar is
too simple to me

820
00:50:40,075 --> 00:50:41,160
Write your name at once

821
00:50:44,333 --> 00:50:45,085
I don't know how to write

822
00:50:55,816 --> 00:50:58,363
Chan, what's wrong with you?

823
00:51:01,745 --> 00:51:02,831
Nightmare again?

824
00:51:04,459 --> 00:51:05,545
Don't think so much!

825
00:51:12,768 --> 00:51:13,687
Although you have taken

826
00:51:13,896 --> 00:51:15,482
2 months' rest,

827
00:51:16,317 --> 00:51:17,737
your legs and hands have not been
totally recovered.

828
00:51:19,198 --> 00:51:20,368
Coming

829
00:51:20,743 --> 00:51:23,415
I am going to beg for food

830
00:51:23,875 --> 00:51:25,211
I will make the last herbal tea

831
00:51:25,294 --> 00:51:26,338
for you later

832
00:51:26,964 --> 00:51:28,759
Dad, you go begging again?

833
00:51:29,260 --> 00:51:31,307
This job should be left to me

834
00:51:31,390 --> 00:51:32,934
You are the Scholar…

835
00:51:36,192 --> 00:51:39,491
Chan, to be a beggar,

836
00:51:39,574 --> 00:51:41,328
there are some lessons!

837
00:51:41,870 --> 00:51:44,376
You can't just show your hand
and beg for money

838
00:51:44,459 --> 00:51:47,298
At least you should have a bowl,
that represents your class

839
00:51:47,382 --> 00:51:49,888
Is it ridiculous?

840
00:51:49,971 --> 00:51:51,975
Hurry up

841
00:51:53,478 --> 00:51:54,605
I am coming

842
00:51:55,816 --> 00:51:57,153
We can't beg for good
if we are late!

843
00:51:57,236 --> 00:51:58,572
Yes…

844
00:52:18,572 --> 00:52:19,157
Give me money, please

845
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:20,451
Go, go, I won't give you money

846
00:52:20,534 --> 00:52:24,167
Go, don't stop me
from doing business

847
00:52:27,633 --> 00:52:28,718
Chan, dad is leaving

848
00:52:41,411 --> 00:52:44,375
Thank you…

849
00:52:51,182 --> 00:52:52,852
Thank you…

850
00:53:00,201 --> 00:53:01,203
Are you that mean?

851
00:53:01,287 --> 00:53:02,414
Why don't you write it yourself?

852
00:53:02,497 --> 00:53:05,294
You are off duty, so I just
want to lend it.

853
00:53:06,297 --> 00:53:07,257
Don't you think I am an idiot?

854
00:53:42,331 --> 00:53:43,250
Dad!

855
00:53:45,337 --> 00:53:46,172
What are you doing?

856
00:53:46,631 --> 00:53:50,097
I am cold… I am cold… Chan

857
00:53:52,101 --> 00:53:55,233
No, your body is as hot as fire

858
00:53:56,360 --> 00:53:57,112
Are you sick?

859
00:53:57,195 --> 00:53:58,698
I am not…

860
00:54:00,326 --> 00:54:01,161
It's late

861
00:54:02,289 --> 00:54:03,751
I have to search for food

862
00:54:05,754 --> 00:54:07,716
Lie down, I will go this time

863
00:54:08,343 --> 00:54:09,512
Are you going for begging?

864
00:54:10,472 --> 00:54:12,393
I have my own way to get food

865
00:54:12,811 --> 00:54:13,771
Take a rest now

866
00:54:13,855 --> 00:54:15,317
I will take you to the doctor after
getting some money

867
00:54:35,232 --> 00:54:36,610
You bastard, why don't you eat?

868
00:54:36,694 --> 00:54:39,074
You should eat more so as
to be strong!

869
00:54:42,164 --> 00:54:43,166
Finish it

870
00:54:43,458 --> 00:54:44,460
No, I am full

871
00:54:44,543 --> 00:54:46,882
You should take all the food

872
00:54:47,842 --> 00:54:49,888
OK, just forget it,
let's go home

873
00:54:51,225 --> 00:54:54,481
Come on, eat them all

874
00:54:57,530 --> 00:54:58,031
Little kid!

875
00:54:58,114 --> 00:54:58,866
What?

876
00:54:58,990 --> 00:54:59,658
May I…

877
00:54:59,742 --> 00:55:00,702
No

878
00:55:18,949 --> 00:55:25,045
Be merciful!

879
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:32,687
Be merciful to me, please

880
00:55:35,067 --> 00:55:37,280
My dad is dying!

881
00:55:39,492 --> 00:55:41,455
Beggar, do you want
the broken carbon?

882
00:55:41,538 --> 00:55:42,665
Thank you

883
00:55:43,584 --> 00:55:45,296
Can you give me some coins?

884
00:55:46,382 --> 00:55:48,094
It's you!

885
00:55:48,469 --> 00:55:49,304
No, you are mistaken

886
00:55:49,847 --> 00:55:51,308
Sister, it's him

887
00:55:51,601 --> 00:55:52,561
No, no

888
00:55:52,603 --> 00:55:54,482
Sister, he is So Chan

889
00:55:58,156 --> 00:55:59,033
Wait!

890
00:56:03,668 --> 00:56:05,630
Miss, who are you looking for?

891
00:56:08,052 --> 00:56:09,638
I am sorry, I have mistaken.

892
00:56:10,098 --> 00:56:11,642
Tracy, take some dumplings out

893
00:56:12,018 --> 00:56:14,022
You have mistaken,
he is not So Chan

894
00:56:15,609 --> 00:56:16,653
You are like my friend

895
00:56:17,572 --> 00:56:20,244
Come to get some dumplings if you
get nothing to eat

896
00:56:21,163 --> 00:56:22,667
We always have surplus

897
00:56:24,419 --> 00:56:25,129
Dumplings

898
00:56:25,254 --> 00:56:26,214
Take it

899
00:56:29,930 --> 00:56:31,517
Thank you…

900
00:56:34,273 --> 00:56:35,025
Sister, he wouldn't
be that poor

901
00:56:35,108 --> 00:56:37,864
if it were not for you

902
00:56:51,601 --> 00:56:53,647
Dad, what are you doing?

903
00:56:53,730 --> 00:56:56,236
I can't stand the hunger.

904
00:56:56,319 --> 00:56:59,743
So I bit the dumpling of the kid.

905
00:57:00,495 --> 00:57:02,082
I have dumpling, take it back.

906
00:57:02,165 --> 00:57:02,957
Could I pay you another head

907
00:57:03,042 --> 00:57:05,129
if I chopped yours?

908
00:57:07,551 --> 00:57:08,929
Are you the Scholar?

909
00:57:11,058 --> 00:57:13,230
Yes, are you the Scholar?

910
00:57:14,607 --> 00:57:15,317
I was nearly the Scholar

911
00:57:15,401 --> 00:57:16,988
He is the Scholar!

912
00:57:17,363 --> 00:57:18,825
We should give him face

913
00:57:18,908 --> 00:57:20,787
Thank you

914
00:57:20,871 --> 00:57:23,000
Hold it

915
00:57:25,172 --> 00:57:26,800
Are they going to treat me

916
00:57:26,884 --> 00:57:29,222
some food?

917
00:57:32,937 --> 00:57:33,856
The dog's rice

918
00:57:34,774 --> 00:57:37,990
Sir, I will let your dad go if you eat
the dog's rice now

919
00:57:43,083 --> 00:57:43,960
What's the matter?

920
00:57:44,754 --> 00:57:45,756
Come on

921
00:57:56,195 --> 00:57:57,781
Chan, don't eat that

922
00:57:57,864 --> 00:57:59,326
You can't face the
others if you eat this

923
00:58:00,328 --> 00:58:02,165
Let's forget about me

924
00:58:02,499 --> 00:58:04,963
Sir, I was a general in Canton

925
00:58:06,883 --> 00:58:07,551
So what?

926
00:58:07,635 --> 00:58:08,554
Stop fighting

927
00:58:08,637 --> 00:58:10,015
Stand properly

928
00:58:17,406 --> 00:58:19,160
The Scholar eats the dog's food

929
00:58:20,829 --> 00:58:21,915
It's quite delicious

930
00:58:24,796 --> 00:58:27,092
Try some. Come on

931
00:58:30,975 --> 00:58:33,522
It's delicious, isn't it?

932
00:58:38,115 --> 00:58:39,410
Dad, look!

933
00:58:40,245 --> 00:58:41,497
There is a slice of meat here

934
00:58:41,581 --> 00:58:43,502
It's pork chop!

935
00:58:53,689 --> 00:58:55,318
They are as hungry as dogs!

936
00:58:55,401 --> 00:58:57,238
Enjoy the dog food!

937
00:58:59,452 --> 00:59:02,040
Hurry, finish it

938
00:59:03,293 --> 00:59:04,462
That's too delicious!

939
00:59:04,837 --> 00:59:06,842
I want to save it
for a midnight snack

940
00:59:06,926 --> 00:59:07,845
It's very clever of you!

941
00:59:08,178 --> 00:59:10,015
You deserve to be beggars

942
00:59:12,562 --> 00:59:14,023
The Scholar is eating dog food

943
00:59:14,191 --> 00:59:15,318
Come on, let's go and
eat the man's food

944
00:59:21,790 --> 00:59:22,917
Uncle So!

945
00:59:27,802 --> 00:59:29,097
You are…

946
00:59:29,597 --> 00:59:31,184
My dad was the Master of the
Beggars' Association

947
00:59:31,561 --> 00:59:33,774
Why don't you join our Beggars'
Association

948
00:59:34,233 --> 00:59:35,360
Uncle Mok, isn't it a good idea?

949
00:59:35,444 --> 00:59:36,279
Good

950
00:59:36,362 --> 00:59:38,032
Isn't it the association
for beggars?

951
00:59:38,074 --> 00:59:38,951
Yes!

952
00:59:39,035 --> 00:59:40,914
That's right,
we are being beggars

953
00:59:40,997 --> 00:59:43,043
It's wise to join the Beggars' Association
so as to be taken care of

954
00:59:43,084 --> 00:59:45,464
Chan…
where is that fool going?

955
00:59:45,548 --> 00:59:46,717
Where is Chan?

956
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:48,095
OK, we will join you!

957
00:59:48,179 --> 00:59:50,517
Chan… Chan…

958
01:00:02,709 --> 01:00:05,339
Yushang, good year!

959
01:00:05,423 --> 01:00:07,510
Uncle Mok, happy new year!

960
01:00:07,594 --> 01:00:08,846
This is for you

961
01:00:09,264 --> 01:00:10,558
Thank you

962
01:00:12,646 --> 01:00:13,899
One cloth is for you

963
01:00:13,982 --> 01:00:15,067
and the other is for Chan

964
01:00:16,070 --> 01:00:17,532
Thank you. Put it down first

965
01:00:19,244 --> 01:00:20,036
Do you have any coins?

966
01:00:20,121 --> 01:00:20,955
Yes!

967
01:00:21,039 --> 01:00:22,124
Give them to me, come on

968
01:00:22,166 --> 01:00:23,126
What for?

969
01:00:23,168 --> 01:00:25,047
It's new year,

970
01:00:25,131 --> 01:00:26,885
you should receive red pocket

971
01:00:26,968 --> 01:00:28,513
Come on, happy new year

972
01:00:29,139 --> 01:00:29,849
Good year!

973
01:00:29,932 --> 01:00:31,144
Wish you ever beauty

974
01:00:31,185 --> 01:00:31,936
Thank you…

975
01:00:32,020 --> 01:00:33,022
Uncle Mok, we needn't give red
pockets to each other

976
01:00:33,106 --> 01:00:34,191
How about Chan

977
01:00:34,525 --> 01:00:38,909
Chan?

978
01:00:39,076 --> 01:00:40,203
He is still sleeping

979
01:00:40,288 --> 01:00:42,417
Don't wake him up

980
01:00:43,252 --> 01:00:44,713
I will cook you some new year cakes

981
01:00:45,339 --> 01:00:48,136
Let me help you

982
01:00:49,682 --> 01:00:51,394
How can he sleep on the
1st day of this year?

983
01:00:52,772 --> 01:00:54,609
He is useless

984
01:00:57,615 --> 01:00:58,576
Are you all here?

985
01:00:59,495 --> 01:01:02,251
To fight against Chiu, we need a union of
the Beggars' Association

986
01:01:03,628 --> 01:01:05,967
So we must choose a new master to
in-charge the association

987
01:01:07,260 --> 01:01:09,181
Yushang…

988
01:01:10,350 --> 01:01:12,187
To defeat the Lotus position
of the three seniors

989
01:01:12,270 --> 01:01:13,273
You should try your best

990
01:01:14,108 --> 01:01:16,990
Uncle, I don't have
faith in defeating them

991
01:01:17,448 --> 01:01:19,243
Judging from my kung-fu now,

992
01:01:19,327 --> 01:01:21,833
how can I defeat them and become
the new master?

993
01:01:23,628 --> 01:01:26,843
Take this Taiwan pill, after this,
your power will be improved

994
01:01:27,594 --> 01:01:30,517
No, this is the only medicine to cure
your inner injury

995
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:31,686
How can I take this?

996
01:01:32,104 --> 01:01:33,273
Don't worry,

997
01:01:33,314 --> 01:01:35,528
you can ask my
son to fight for you

998
01:01:35,611 --> 01:01:38,200
He was a scholar
of Martial Arts before…

999
01:01:38,284 --> 01:01:39,369
Before…

1000
01:01:39,453 --> 01:01:40,998
Look at him, he is so lazy,

1001
01:01:41,081 --> 01:01:43,085
he knows sleeping only

1002
01:01:43,461 --> 01:01:45,298
He is not even
qualified to be a beggar!

1003
01:01:45,382 --> 01:01:46,885
Don't be that frank, can you?

1004
01:01:48,346 --> 01:01:49,723
Don't shout that loudly, OK?

1005
01:01:58,618 --> 01:02:03,128
Chan, no matter
how they despise you,

1006
01:02:04,714 --> 01:02:06,383
I have faith in you

1007
01:02:07,512 --> 01:02:09,391
Although you lost your power

1008
01:02:09,933 --> 01:02:11,478
With your background,

1009
01:02:11,853 --> 01:02:13,357
only if you try hard,

1010
01:02:13,398 --> 01:02:15,444
you can achieve something.

1011
01:02:15,862 --> 01:02:17,866
But I am now powerless,
I don't want to fight again

1012
01:02:17,950 --> 01:02:19,202
You have power!

1013
01:02:19,286 --> 01:02:20,246
Come on, beat me

1014
01:02:24,338 --> 01:02:25,590
See, that was powerful

1015
01:02:25,967 --> 01:02:27,596
Well, being a people…

1016
01:02:28,137 --> 01:02:29,724
Forget it, don't waste time

1017
01:02:29,808 --> 01:02:31,353
Why don't you let me sleep?

1018
01:02:37,532 --> 01:02:38,284
Why did you lock the door?

1019
01:02:38,367 --> 01:02:39,495
Enjoy sleeping

1020
01:02:54,401 --> 01:02:55,194
Son,

1021
01:02:55,278 --> 01:02:57,992
I tried very hard
to get this for you

1022
01:02:58,409 --> 01:03:01,499
Try hard to practise, be good

1023
01:03:24,589 --> 01:03:25,674
Why do you go up?

1024
01:03:26,802 --> 01:03:28,472
Even you want me
to practise Kung-fu,

1025
01:03:28,556 --> 01:03:30,895
you should give me a waddy first

1026
01:03:32,565 --> 01:03:34,193
I am sorry, catch it

1027
01:03:43,003 --> 01:03:45,675
Before being appointed an
important task,

1028
01:03:45,758 --> 01:03:50,894
God will give you severe
training for soul and flesh.

1029
01:03:57,992 --> 01:04:00,664
Did you write it?

1030
01:04:01,625 --> 01:04:06,511
It's ugly, it's right
to wipe it away.

1031
01:04:08,514 --> 01:04:10,560
Hey, beggar?

1032
01:04:10,936 --> 01:04:11,563
Yes

1033
01:04:11,646 --> 01:04:12,523
Me too

1034
01:04:13,107 --> 01:04:14,109
Congratulations

1035
01:04:14,819 --> 01:04:16,614
Is there anything to eat?

1036
01:04:16,698 --> 01:04:17,700
No

1037
01:04:17,784 --> 01:04:19,287
Luckily, I have

1038
01:04:25,091 --> 01:04:27,930
See your look,

1039
01:04:28,013 --> 01:04:29,140
it's a waste
for you not to beg

1040
01:04:29,767 --> 01:04:30,852
None of your damn business

1041
01:04:32,063 --> 01:04:33,358
You are too lazy to be a beggar!

1042
01:04:33,441 --> 01:04:34,986
Your fellows despise you

1043
01:04:37,574 --> 01:04:39,286
I was always respected by others

1044
01:04:39,746 --> 01:04:41,040
But now, I am despised

1045
01:04:41,709 --> 01:04:42,961
Dislike from you,

1046
01:04:43,044 --> 01:04:45,049
no one respected me before

1047
01:04:45,466 --> 01:04:48,555
Listen to me. Don't go!

1048
01:04:49,224 --> 01:04:53,483
I remembered once in Canton

1049
01:04:53,567 --> 01:04:56,531
A fool paid my living,
including hooking

1050
01:04:56,614 --> 01:04:58,159
What a weird man

1051
01:05:01,041 --> 01:05:02,586
Kid, I remembered you

1052
01:05:03,295 --> 01:05:05,258
Me too

1053
01:05:05,342 --> 01:05:06,469
Hey, hurry up

1054
01:05:06,552 --> 01:05:08,014
Repay my money,
I am in urgent need

1055
01:05:08,139 --> 01:05:09,224
If I had money,

1056
01:05:09,308 --> 01:05:11,688
I wouldn't be a beggar!

1057
01:05:15,780 --> 01:05:18,411
But, don't worry,
you were my benefactor,

1058
01:05:18,494 --> 01:05:19,705
I will repay you one day

1059
01:05:21,541 --> 01:05:23,045
Thank you very much

1060
01:05:24,255 --> 01:05:25,592
But, you can't buy
back what you lost

1061
01:05:25,884 --> 01:05:27,554
even if you have money again

1062
01:05:29,225 --> 01:05:30,102
What did I lose?

1063
01:05:30,185 --> 01:05:32,606
Pride and faith

1064
01:05:32,691 --> 01:05:34,402
And your woman too

1065
01:05:36,990 --> 01:05:37,992
What are you?

1066
01:05:38,369 --> 01:05:42,335
I am Hung Yat-sun,
nicknamed Old Bag Sun

1067
01:05:42,419 --> 01:05:45,885
I am the most senior
one among the beggars

1068
01:05:45,968 --> 01:05:47,220
It's good to be a beggar

1069
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:49,309
You can do everything you want

1070
01:05:49,392 --> 01:05:50,603
You can do the same

1071
01:05:50,686 --> 01:05:53,358
Tell me, what do you want?
I will make your wish come true

1072
01:05:53,943 --> 01:05:54,820
I want to be human again

1073
01:05:54,903 --> 01:05:56,615
Don't you think you
are not human-like?

1074
01:05:58,160 --> 01:05:59,497
Not at all

1075
01:05:59,580 --> 01:06:02,044
So you have to be a beggar now

1076
01:06:04,506 --> 01:06:07,137
Very good! Very good!

1077
01:06:07,722 --> 01:06:11,020
But I won't cheat you,
from your head to toes

1078
01:06:11,103 --> 01:06:13,358
Every part of you is beggar-like

1079
01:06:14,904 --> 01:06:15,571
So what?

1080
01:06:15,654 --> 01:06:18,034
That means, you will be a beggar
for your life

1081
01:06:20,957 --> 01:06:23,421
I don't want to talk to you,
I want to sleep first

1082
01:06:23,922 --> 01:06:25,927
Don't go, you can achieve
in your profession

1083
01:06:26,052 --> 01:06:27,137
From my judgement,

1084
01:06:27,221 --> 01:06:28,891
you will be the King of Beggars

1085
01:06:29,433 --> 01:06:31,855
King of Beggars,
what does that mean?

1086
01:06:33,692 --> 01:06:34,736
That is beggar

1087
01:06:38,912 --> 01:06:40,874
I won't care who you are,
I just want to stop the conversation.

1088
01:06:40,958 --> 01:06:42,920
Please step aside,
don't stop me from sleeping.

1089
01:06:43,713 --> 01:06:44,715
Damn you!

1090
01:06:44,841 --> 01:06:47,055
No… I just want to sleep with you.

1091
01:06:48,306 --> 01:06:49,141
Idiot!

1092
01:06:53,233 --> 01:06:55,864
Kid, see you in the dream

1093
01:07:07,138 --> 01:07:09,559
Before the Buddha, the Disciples
return to your position

1094
01:07:11,021 --> 01:07:14,277
To suppress the dragon and tiger

1095
01:07:21,292 --> 01:07:23,672
So Chan, you enjoyed the
prosperity of the world

1096
01:07:23,756 --> 01:07:25,551
And you tasted the bitter
fruit of the world too

1097
01:07:25,968 --> 01:07:27,263
Now you regret it

1098
01:07:27,639 --> 01:07:30,353
On behalf of Master Hung

1099
01:07:30,436 --> 01:07:32,023
I appoint you to be the
“Sleeping Disciple”

1100
01:07:32,065 --> 01:07:35,948
Now, I will teach you the
“Sleeping Disciple's Fist”!

1101
01:07:36,031 --> 01:07:38,495
Hope you can make good use of it
Come on

1102
01:07:43,881 --> 01:07:48,264
Senior…

1103
01:07:53,401 --> 01:07:56,032
The bitter past

1104
01:08:00,958 --> 01:08:04,507
Long life to you…

1105
01:08:07,138 --> 01:08:09,685
Here comes the White Goat

1106
01:08:10,353 --> 01:08:14,486
My mother, give me power

1107
01:08:15,113 --> 01:08:16,157
To save the people!

1108
01:08:37,660 --> 01:08:39,372
Tomorrow the Emperor
will go hunting

1109
01:08:39,790 --> 01:08:42,671
I will send him a pretty girl,
so as to get close to him

1110
01:08:44,633 --> 01:08:47,806
Yuen Ling, you should
seduce him tomorrow

1111
01:08:48,307 --> 01:08:49,184
Yes

1112
01:08:50,688 --> 01:08:52,107
If we can kill the Emperor,

1113
01:08:52,650 --> 01:08:54,027
I can take over his reign

1114
01:08:54,737 --> 01:08:57,243
I will give you a share of wealth!

1115
01:09:02,295 --> 01:09:05,761
Long life to you

1116
01:09:06,512 --> 01:09:07,222
Senior!

1117
01:09:07,306 --> 01:09:08,475
Let's go back now

1118
01:09:40,541 --> 01:09:41,168
Senior!

1119
01:09:41,251 --> 01:09:41,918
Let's go!

1120
01:09:55,072 --> 01:09:55,907
Senior!

1121
01:10:35,072 --> 01:10:35,782
Let's chase them

1122
01:10:35,865 --> 01:10:39,081
Stop
The Emperor is setting off soon

1123
01:10:40,625 --> 01:10:41,753
You killed a woman…

1124
01:10:42,087 --> 01:10:43,256
You should replace her as
a gift to the Emperor!

1125
01:10:49,644 --> 01:10:51,858
No one dares come up to fight for
the leadership?

1126
01:10:52,441 --> 01:10:54,655
Ask Mok to give us the
“Dog Hitting Waddy”!

1127
01:10:56,742 --> 01:11:00,625
Ask that old bag to
hand us the waddy

1128
01:11:00,792 --> 01:11:03,924
Where have they been?

1129
01:11:04,509 --> 01:11:05,636
I don't know,

1130
01:11:06,346 --> 01:11:08,475
I saw them chat,

1131
01:11:08,517 --> 01:11:09,561
then they went away

1132
01:11:12,316 --> 01:11:13,485
Are there any affairs between them?

1133
01:11:25,302 --> 01:11:26,639
Now, we are going to choose
the new leader

1134
01:11:33,486 --> 01:11:34,446
Uncle Mok…

1135
01:11:34,529 --> 01:11:35,448
I am scared,

1136
01:11:35,531 --> 01:11:36,241
I think you won't come back.

1137
01:11:36,366 --> 01:11:37,451
How is it? Where is sister?

1138
01:11:38,580 --> 01:11:40,124
Your sister is caught by Chiu

1139
01:11:40,793 --> 01:11:42,755
We'd find someone to compete
for the leadership.

1140
01:11:49,060 --> 01:11:50,522
Who should go?

1141
01:12:05,136 --> 01:12:05,720
I'll do it

1142
01:12:05,803 --> 01:12:06,596
Uncle Mok

1143
01:12:06,680 --> 01:12:08,184
Why don't you let me try?

1144
01:12:45,887 --> 01:12:46,847
Chan,

1145
01:12:48,768 --> 01:12:50,689
you are not qualified, come down

1146
01:12:52,275 --> 01:12:55,156
Since you don't have a good candidate,
I'll give you some advantage

1147
01:12:55,699 --> 01:12:57,578
Chan, it's not a game

1148
01:12:57,995 --> 01:12:59,749
You will be killed, come down

1149
01:13:00,167 --> 01:13:02,839
It doesn't matter, I have forgotten
my life already

1150
01:13:03,257 --> 01:13:04,301
Bullshit, throw him to death

1151
01:13:14,154 --> 01:13:15,783
Well, I will make
your wish come true

1152
01:13:44,760 --> 01:13:45,303
What is he doing?

1153
01:13:45,386 --> 01:13:46,096
Sleeping

1154
01:14:00,961 --> 01:14:02,381
Isn't this stance…

1155
01:14:03,424 --> 01:14:05,428
Uncle Sun's "Sleeping Disciple's Fists"?

1156
01:14:06,430 --> 01:14:07,307
Set the position!

1157
01:14:23,675 --> 01:14:24,635
Is it dawn?

1158
01:15:23,383 --> 01:15:24,594
I am sorry!

1159
01:15:25,053 --> 01:15:25,972
I won.

1160
01:15:26,055 --> 01:15:27,266
What is the use for defeating us?

1161
01:15:27,349 --> 01:15:28,226
You don't know how to use the
“Dog Hitting Waddy”.

1162
01:15:29,228 --> 01:15:30,272
You are not qualified to be
the leader of us.

1163
01:15:33,821 --> 01:15:35,241
“Dog Hitting Waddy”?

1164
01:15:39,792 --> 01:15:40,919
It's for hitting dogs

1165
01:15:42,965 --> 01:15:44,302
I do know how to use this waddy!

1166
01:15:44,802 --> 01:15:45,804
But it's unlike
from the standard stances!

1167
01:15:46,181 --> 01:15:46,808
It's quite powerful!

1168
01:15:51,734 --> 01:15:53,153
He broke the waddy!

1169
01:15:55,116 --> 01:15:57,370
He broke the treasure of our Association,
let's kill him!

1170
01:16:11,483 --> 01:16:13,488
I am Master Hung,
who dares go against me?

1171
01:16:14,949 --> 01:16:16,536
I set the rules of the association

1172
01:16:16,619 --> 01:16:19,458
Any student who defeated
the Lotus Position

1173
01:16:19,542 --> 01:16:21,463
could be the leader

1174
01:16:22,089 --> 01:16:23,634
Have you all forgotten?

1175
01:16:24,260 --> 01:16:26,557
We become the
biggest association

1176
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:28,352
because of being united

1177
01:16:29,020 --> 01:16:31,233
I left you the
“Dog Hitting Waddy”,

1178
01:16:31,316 --> 01:16:33,613
is just for memory

1179
01:16:34,030 --> 01:16:36,284
The waddy is meaningless

1180
01:16:36,369 --> 01:16:38,582
But you fools take
this as treasure

1181
01:16:38,665 --> 01:16:41,839
And fight among yourselves for
this damn waddy!

1182
01:16:41,922 --> 01:16:44,594
In these five years, you have had no
leader, don't you feel shy?

1183
01:16:45,179 --> 01:16:46,474
So Chan broke the waddy,

1184
01:16:46,557 --> 01:16:47,684
so you won't fight
for this anymore

1185
01:16:47,768 --> 01:16:49,020
He is correct to do so

1186
01:16:49,313 --> 01:16:50,690
This youngster is so junior,

1187
01:16:50,774 --> 01:16:52,236
but he is a genius, a smart ass

1188
01:16:52,319 --> 01:16:54,532
He is being taught by my disciple
Hung Yat Sun

1189
01:16:54,615 --> 01:16:56,244
Who doesn't respect him is going
against me too

1190
01:16:58,122 --> 01:16:59,207
You should respect him,

1191
01:16:59,292 --> 01:17:00,586
your new leader,
and you'd love him,

1192
01:17:00,669 --> 01:17:04,218
whole-heartedly, to care much for him,
maybe treat him dinner

1193
01:17:04,260 --> 01:17:05,471
Then, although I am in heaven,

1194
01:17:05,554 --> 01:17:09,480
I will bless all of you,
all the best

1195
01:17:11,692 --> 01:17:13,196
Isn't it true?

1196
01:17:14,448 --> 01:17:16,285
You'd better trust it

1197
01:17:16,703 --> 01:17:18,916
Master Hung's soul talked to us,

1198
01:17:18,999 --> 01:17:20,836
we are blessed

1199
01:17:21,922 --> 01:17:24,302
They are easily cheated,
I am really a genius!

1200
01:17:25,221 --> 01:17:26,432
We'll have a better living

1201
01:17:28,770 --> 01:17:30,649
What happened?

1202
01:17:32,486 --> 01:17:33,738
Let's greet the new Master

1203
01:17:37,121 --> 01:17:41,589
You should have faith,
you won, bravo…

1204
01:17:43,426 --> 01:17:45,597
Uncle Mok, my son is really great!

1205
01:17:48,144 --> 01:17:49,856
I can't guess you have learnt the
“Sleeping Disciple's Fists”?!

1206
01:17:52,068 --> 01:17:54,574
From now on, you are the new leader of us

1207
01:17:55,784 --> 01:17:57,663
This is the book of
“Dragon Suppressing Stances”

1208
01:17:57,747 --> 01:17:59,376
And, I will give you the Taiwan Pill

1209
01:18:00,503 --> 01:18:02,466
Hope you will be a good leader

1210
01:18:03,760 --> 01:18:05,597
I just want to save Yushang as
soon as possible

1211
01:18:07,768 --> 01:18:09,563
Yushang didn't make a wrong choice

1212
01:18:10,482 --> 01:18:14,825
Bravo! Bravo!

1213
01:18:19,417 --> 01:18:22,674
Uncle Mok, how are you?

1214
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:25,764
Uncle Mok!

1215
01:18:27,183 --> 01:18:31,442
Uncle Mok…

1216
01:19:20,796 --> 01:19:21,715
Do you understand everything

1217
01:19:21,798 --> 01:19:24,220
written in this book?

1218
01:19:24,303 --> 01:19:25,680
Don't think that I am so foolish

1219
01:19:26,182 --> 01:19:27,559
After getting the
help of Taiwan Pill,

1220
01:19:27,643 --> 01:19:30,567
My initial power is increased

1221
01:19:31,359 --> 01:19:33,948
I can control the 17th stance

1222
01:19:34,366 --> 01:19:37,038
But the last stance,

1223
01:19:37,122 --> 01:19:38,499
there is no picture
or description of it.

1224
01:19:38,834 --> 01:19:40,086
I can't understand it at all

1225
01:19:40,587 --> 01:19:43,593
But Uncle Mok is dead, what'll we do now?

1226
01:19:44,136 --> 01:19:45,139
Just go ahead

1227
01:19:45,222 --> 01:19:47,351
No matter how, I have to save
Yushang first

1228
01:20:59,293 --> 01:21:00,922
Check whether the camp is ready or not?

1229
01:21:01,005 --> 01:21:01,965
Yes!

1230
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:22,800
Chiu,

1231
01:21:23,219 --> 01:21:25,765
why do you bring this woman here?

1232
01:21:25,848 --> 01:21:27,185
I know the Emperor
loves pretty women

1233
01:21:27,268 --> 01:21:29,648
So I want to send him this gift

1234
01:21:30,108 --> 01:21:31,360
And I want to meet him too

1235
01:21:31,778 --> 01:21:33,907
There is no order from the Emperor

1236
01:21:34,534 --> 01:21:36,747
Men, come and take
this woman to the camp

1237
01:21:36,830 --> 01:21:37,958
Yes

1238
01:21:38,542 --> 01:21:39,419
Go!

1239
01:21:42,383 --> 01:21:45,265
Sir, you look great!

1240
01:21:46,725 --> 01:21:48,604
I think you should go back

1241
01:21:48,981 --> 01:21:50,150
to your own position

1242
01:21:50,818 --> 01:21:51,862
Yes

1243
01:22:07,811 --> 01:22:08,646
Your Majesty,

1244
01:22:08,730 --> 01:22:10,734
Officer Chiu brings this woman to you

1245
01:22:11,694 --> 01:22:12,487
Woman?

1246
01:22:14,910 --> 01:22:16,079
Chiu knows my hobby!

1247
01:22:16,997 --> 01:22:19,211
I want to take a bath first,
bring her to me later

1248
01:22:19,294 --> 01:22:20,296
Yes

1249
01:22:43,135 --> 01:22:46,183
This bastard wants
to see the Emperor,

1250
01:22:47,394 --> 01:22:50,484
if I let him see His Majesty often,
my post will be taken away

1251
01:22:55,619 --> 01:22:56,496
Men

1252
01:22:58,208 --> 01:22:59,043
Sir

1253
01:22:59,127 --> 01:23:00,296
Check what has happened

1254
01:23:00,380 --> 01:23:01,382
Yes

1255
01:23:04,805 --> 01:23:07,602
Sir, there are many people coming
from the forest

1256
01:23:08,021 --> 01:23:09,148
Who are they?

1257
01:23:09,941 --> 01:23:10,943
I don't know!

1258
01:23:11,778 --> 01:23:12,530
Release the alarm smoke

1259
01:23:12,614 --> 01:23:13,366
Be alert

1260
01:23:13,449 --> 01:23:14,368
Yes

1261
01:23:23,803 --> 01:23:25,390
There is smoke ahead,
let's get armed

1262
01:23:25,474 --> 01:23:26,309
Yes

1263
01:24:28,313 --> 01:24:29,316
Damn you beggars

1264
01:24:34,201 --> 01:24:36,122
So Chan, what are you doing?

1265
01:24:37,082 --> 01:24:40,255
Nothing, I just want
to beg for money

1266
01:24:40,798 --> 01:24:43,053
Shit, do you want to be killed

1267
01:24:43,428 --> 01:24:44,597
It's you who will be killed

1268
01:24:46,142 --> 01:24:47,519
Chiu wants to raise a rebel,

1269
01:24:47,603 --> 01:24:49,107
he is going to
assassinate the king

1270
01:24:49,190 --> 01:24:50,402
You fat-headed

1271
01:24:51,612 --> 01:24:52,948
Who do you think you are?

1272
01:24:53,241 --> 01:24:55,662
How dare you frame the courtier?

1273
01:24:56,205 --> 01:24:58,251
I will kill you if you step forward

1274
01:25:02,802 --> 01:25:05,266
Chan, how can we fight with them?

1275
01:25:05,349 --> 01:25:06,434
- Senior
- Yes

1276
01:25:07,270 --> 01:25:08,314
Where are the rest of our men?

1277
01:25:08,397 --> 01:25:09,734
They are coming

1278
01:25:11,571 --> 01:25:12,698
We have no time,

1279
01:25:12,781 --> 01:25:14,326
you stay here to wait for the others

1280
01:25:14,410 --> 01:25:15,119
I will go first

1281
01:25:15,245 --> 01:25:15,829
I will follow

1282
01:25:15,912 --> 01:25:16,747
Be serious

1283
01:25:16,831 --> 01:25:18,293
Master, don't worry

1284
01:25:19,045 --> 01:25:20,548
Am I going to die?

1285
01:25:20,631 --> 01:25:22,300
Say something lucky, OK?

1286
01:25:22,677 --> 01:25:27,270
Sure! Happy birthday to you…

1287
01:25:27,312 --> 01:25:30,318
Happy birthday to you…

1288
01:25:30,736 --> 01:25:32,072
Happy birthday to you…

1289
01:25:32,155 --> 01:25:33,115
That's enough

1290
01:25:33,240 --> 01:25:34,200
I haven't finished

1291
01:25:34,284 --> 01:25:35,244
Go on after I left

1292
01:25:35,329 --> 01:25:36,373
Sure

1293
01:25:48,398 --> 01:25:50,402
There is smoke ahead,
someone must have alerted them

1294
01:25:53,408 --> 01:25:54,243
Get ready the Unicom Smoke

1295
01:25:54,326 --> 01:25:54,828
Yes

1296
01:25:54,911 --> 01:25:55,871
Attack the main camp

1297
01:26:56,916 --> 01:27:00,131
Rebel! Help!

1298
01:27:00,924 --> 01:27:01,759
They should be killed

1299
01:27:01,884 --> 01:27:03,763
The one who didn't kill you
should be killed

1300
01:27:05,057 --> 01:27:07,271
Shit, the poisoned smoke

1301
01:27:07,354 --> 01:27:08,565
is blowing to the Royal camp

1302
01:27:14,744 --> 01:27:16,414
No, the wind direction changed

1303
01:27:17,167 --> 01:27:18,711
Yes, wait for me

1304
01:27:20,924 --> 01:27:23,053
If the beggars don't retreat now,
we will kill with no mercy

1305
01:27:42,177 --> 01:27:43,179
Have a look

1306
01:27:47,563 --> 01:27:48,607
The Unicom Smoke of
the Tin Li Sect

1307
01:27:59,672 --> 01:28:01,969
Be calm, urine is the antidote
to the poison

1308
01:28:03,012 --> 01:28:05,266
Come and piss

1309
01:28:09,233 --> 01:28:10,862
How about me?

1310
01:28:11,530 --> 01:28:13,367
Don't worry,
I can give you some urine

1311
01:28:13,450 --> 01:28:14,410
Come on, hold it

1312
01:28:20,841 --> 01:28:21,801
Rush in!

1313
01:28:31,196 --> 01:28:31,948
How is the situation?

1314
01:28:32,031 --> 01:28:34,036
Thanks for Your Majesty's luck,
the wind direction changed

1315
01:28:34,161 --> 01:28:35,622
The smoke is going
in the other direction

1316
01:28:35,705 --> 01:28:37,209
How about our armies?

1317
01:28:37,292 --> 01:28:39,004
They are all dead

1318
01:28:40,089 --> 01:28:40,966
Bring me the sword

1319
01:28:41,050 --> 01:28:42,010
Don't… don't!

1320
01:28:42,135 --> 01:28:43,680
Get lost! Get lost!

1321
01:28:43,722 --> 01:28:45,768
Your Majesty, it's dangerous,
don't go!

1322
01:28:45,851 --> 01:28:48,733
Get lost, don't you want
to wait for death, get lost

1323
01:28:50,152 --> 01:28:51,196
You are ordered to get away

1324
01:28:51,864 --> 01:28:54,286
You can't go!

1325
01:29:32,742 --> 01:29:33,911
Protect me

1326
01:29:59,004 --> 01:29:59,881
Chan?

1327
01:30:02,053 --> 01:30:02,845
Yushang

1328
01:30:02,929 --> 01:30:04,224
How did you get here?

1329
01:30:04,850 --> 01:30:06,771
It's a long story

1330
01:30:06,854 --> 01:30:08,733
We left our base last night

1331
01:30:08,858 --> 01:30:09,985
We reached the Great Wall

1332
01:30:10,069 --> 01:30:12,324
this morning

1333
01:30:12,408 --> 01:30:14,412
We stayed one hour for lunch

1334
01:30:14,495 --> 01:30:15,873
I pissed once

1335
01:30:15,957 --> 01:30:16,792
Really?

1336
01:30:16,875 --> 01:30:18,127
Yes, then I want to
eat a sweet potato

1337
01:30:18,253 --> 01:30:19,213
But only dumplings left

1338
01:30:19,296 --> 01:30:21,676
You know, I don't
like eating dumplings

1339
01:30:22,846 --> 01:30:24,850
I am late to save you,
please forgive me

1340
01:30:27,272 --> 01:30:28,024
To protect the Emperor

1341
01:30:28,524 --> 01:30:29,484
Yes

1342
01:30:32,825 --> 01:30:33,493
You betrayer!

1343
01:30:33,577 --> 01:30:34,287
Catch him

1344
01:30:40,759 --> 01:30:41,552
Your Majesty

1345
01:30:45,017 --> 01:30:46,812
You bastard, give your kingdom to me

1346
01:30:46,896 --> 01:30:48,024
Are you telling him?

1347
01:30:51,155 --> 01:30:51,948
It's you

1348
01:30:51,990 --> 01:30:53,619
Yes, I am Beggar So

1349
01:30:54,412 --> 01:30:57,376
Why don't you sleep in your hut?

1350
01:30:57,835 --> 01:31:00,007
Well, I am a little bit sleepy

1351
01:31:37,334 --> 01:31:38,127
“Sleeping Disciple”?

1352
01:31:38,671 --> 01:31:42,596
Yes. Look at you, you are
like a beggar too

1353
01:31:42,679 --> 01:31:44,183
Are you interested in joining us?

1354
01:31:46,103 --> 01:31:48,232
I can't guess you could recover!

1355
01:31:48,692 --> 01:31:50,404
Yes, it's all because of you

1356
01:31:54,955 --> 01:31:56,959
Did you generate all your force?
I didn't

1357
01:32:15,623 --> 01:32:18,755
Fool, only the “Dragon Suppressing
Stances” scare me

1358
01:32:18,797 --> 01:32:20,551
I won't give a damn
to any other stances

1359
01:32:33,118 --> 01:32:34,955
“Dragon Suppress Stances”

1360
01:32:37,627 --> 01:32:38,754
“Dragon in the sky”

1361
01:32:40,383 --> 01:32:41,093
“Dragon swings its tail”

1362
01:32:41,385 --> 01:32:42,095
“Dragon steals the heart”

1363
01:32:42,179 --> 01:32:42,972
Dragon swims,
dragon in the field,

1364
01:32:43,139 --> 01:32:44,183
dragon dances…

1365
01:32:44,224 --> 01:32:45,184
Dragon's descendant,

1366
01:32:45,269 --> 01:32:46,313
dragon's wish…

1367
01:32:46,396 --> 01:32:47,648
Dragon's spirit, dragon's couple

1368
01:32:47,732 --> 01:32:49,110
Finished

1369
01:33:23,640 --> 01:33:26,146
You can't finish the last stance,

1370
01:33:26,229 --> 01:33:27,273
you can defeat me

1371
01:33:27,482 --> 01:33:28,484
after learning the 18th stance

1372
01:33:28,609 --> 01:33:29,861
But you have no chance

1373
01:33:38,212 --> 01:33:39,047
Chan!

1374
01:33:53,620 --> 01:33:55,875
I've got it
Just mix the 17 stances,

1375
01:33:55,958 --> 01:33:56,918
it's the 18th stance then

1376
01:33:57,586 --> 01:33:59,215
I am too smart!

1377
01:34:29,278 --> 01:34:31,617
The 18 stance, “It's a regret to
kill the Dragon”!

1378
01:35:01,762 --> 01:35:03,642
Chan, are you alright?

1379
01:35:04,059 --> 01:35:05,563
See, don't you
think I am alright?

1380
01:35:06,481 --> 01:35:07,608
Your post is really smart

1381
01:35:07,691 --> 01:35:09,486
But your look is awful!

1382
01:35:09,528 --> 01:35:10,613
Idiot, I am fine

1383
01:35:10,697 --> 01:35:11,992
I can marry tonight

1384
01:35:24,978 --> 01:35:25,520
Sister!

1385
01:35:25,603 --> 01:35:26,480
Tracy!

1386
01:35:26,564 --> 01:35:27,440
Where is Chiu?

1387
01:35:28,527 --> 01:35:29,446
He is around

1388
01:35:29,696 --> 01:35:31,032
Around?

1389
01:35:31,449 --> 01:35:32,701
He became ashes

1390
01:35:33,578 --> 01:35:35,207
Damn it!

1391
01:35:35,290 --> 01:35:36,584
Master

1392
01:35:36,669 --> 01:35:38,506
Chiu's fellows are
all caught by us

1393
01:35:42,723 --> 01:35:43,808
Thank you, buddies

1394
01:35:47,984 --> 01:35:48,777
Yushang

1395
01:35:48,861 --> 01:35:50,531
We have an agreement,
do you remember?

1396
01:35:51,908 --> 01:35:55,124
Yes, be the top of all.

1397
01:35:55,207 --> 01:35:57,420
Invincible

1398
01:35:57,755 --> 01:35:59,466
But, I can't be the Scholar

1399
01:35:59,550 --> 01:36:02,473
But I don't like Scholar at all.

1400
01:36:02,806 --> 01:36:04,226
I love beggar.

1401
01:36:06,189 --> 01:36:07,441
You first, I will go after you.

1402
01:36:21,053 --> 01:36:24,352
Seng-ko-lin-ch'in,
you are really a fool

1403
01:36:24,435 --> 01:36:26,104
You bring a thief to harm me

1404
01:36:26,689 --> 01:36:28,443
Now, you are titled to be a beggar

1405
01:36:28,945 --> 01:36:31,283
You have potential to be a beggar

1406
01:36:32,034 --> 01:36:33,203
Report duty in the temple tomorrow

1407
01:36:33,830 --> 01:36:35,249
If there is anyone bullies you,
just tell them my name

1408
01:36:36,919 --> 01:36:39,091
Thank you, thank you master

1409
01:36:39,174 --> 01:36:42,013
So Chan, what do you want as reward?

1410
01:36:44,978 --> 01:36:46,063
Don't you have anything to tell me?

1411
01:36:50,656 --> 01:36:52,703
Nothing special, let's go

1412
01:36:55,542 --> 01:36:57,253
Mister So!

1413
01:36:57,337 --> 01:36:58,506
Put it down

1414
01:36:58,882 --> 01:36:59,926
Although you have saved me,

1415
01:37:00,009 --> 01:37:02,473
if you don't respect me, I will kill you

1416
01:37:03,391 --> 01:37:05,605
If so, you needn't
squat and talk to me

1417
01:37:06,397 --> 01:37:09,028
Don't move, it'll
attract their attention

1418
01:37:11,951 --> 01:37:13,537
Actually we have no relation,

1419
01:37:13,621 --> 01:37:15,291
we have nothing to chat about

1420
01:37:15,793 --> 01:37:17,254
You have billions of fellows

1421
01:37:17,337 --> 01:37:19,717
Your force makes me worry

1422
01:37:20,803 --> 01:37:22,849
The number of fellows doesn't
depend on me,

1423
01:37:22,932 --> 01:37:24,018
but you

1424
01:37:24,101 --> 01:37:25,186
What?

1425
01:37:26,272 --> 01:37:28,903
If you are great, making the
society peaceful and wealthy,

1426
01:37:29,278 --> 01:37:31,408
no one wishes to be a beggar, right?

1427
01:37:32,994 --> 01:37:34,706
It's reasonable

1428
01:37:34,790 --> 01:37:35,709
Be smart

1429
01:37:36,544 --> 01:37:37,546
But,

1430
01:37:38,172 --> 01:37:40,218
give me some face

1431
01:37:41,471 --> 01:37:42,306
Yes

1432
01:37:42,390 --> 01:37:44,811
Long life to Your Majesty

1433
01:37:44,853 --> 01:37:46,190
Get up

1434
01:37:52,327 --> 01:37:53,746
Pal, do you know me?

1435
01:37:54,248 --> 01:37:56,002
Of course! You beggar

1436
01:37:56,085 --> 01:37:57,797
You beg with your girl, you think I'll
give you money out of mercy?

1437
01:37:57,881 --> 01:37:59,050
Yes, please give me money

1438
01:37:59,133 --> 01:38:01,304
No mercy, go away

1439
01:38:01,387 --> 01:38:02,390
No, you should pay me

1440
01:38:02,891 --> 01:38:04,185
It's a must, pal

1441
01:38:05,020 --> 01:38:07,484
A must? Kidding?

1442
01:38:07,943 --> 01:38:10,156
It's true, be quick

1443
01:38:10,239 --> 01:38:11,241
It's bad luck to meet you

1444
01:38:11,701 --> 01:38:12,661
Stop

1445
01:38:12,745 --> 01:38:13,580
What?

1446
01:38:13,663 --> 01:38:16,711
See my family? Give more

1447
01:38:16,794 --> 01:38:17,879
How much?

1448
01:38:17,922 --> 01:38:19,342
Not less than a thousand, got me?

1449
01:38:24,018 --> 01:38:25,563
Say thank you now

1450
01:38:25,647 --> 01:38:28,486
Thank you, uncle
