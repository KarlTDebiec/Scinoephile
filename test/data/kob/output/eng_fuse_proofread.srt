1
00:01:43,312 --> 00:01:44,646
Young master, we are ready

2
00:02:26,021 --> 00:02:26,647
What's a hard job for you, young master

3
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:28,190
The towel, young master

4
00:02:37,074 --> 00:02:38,367
What did he write?

5
00:02:38,617 --> 00:02:39,493
His name!

6
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:44,039
Great! Young master knows how to
write his name!

7
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:45,749
Yes!

8
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:52,172
Nice calligraphy

9
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,466
Get lost

10
00:02:56,635 --> 00:03:01,765
Nice calligraphy! So Cha Ha Yee Chan!

11
00:03:01,932 --> 00:03:02,766
It's reversed, Master

12
00:03:03,392 --> 00:03:05,060
Chan Yee Ha Cha So

13
00:03:05,227 --> 00:03:09,022
Good boy, but, don't be proud! Got me?

14
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:13,860
Dad, since the first
emperor of the Ching Dynasty,

15
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:15,654
our family

16
00:03:15,654 --> 00:03:17,447
has been illiterate

17
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:20,742
But not, my son, that's your grandson,

18
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:22,536
he knows how to write his name!

19
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:25,872
Dad, it's very great!

20
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:27,916
He knows writing now,

21
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:29,710
he will be scholar one day

22
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,336
Now, he knows how to write his name,

23
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:33,088
he will have a son later

24
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:35,799
Young master, you should try hard to learn

25
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:38,051
Chan, I think, we should mount it

26
00:03:38,093 --> 00:03:38,719
OK

27
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,971
Professor, show it in some obvious places

28
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:42,222
By the way, one minute,

29
00:03:42,264 --> 00:03:45,100
why don't you carry it with traditional
decoration in the street?

30
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:46,393
Let's go!

31
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:48,812
Chan, come and sit…

32
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:52,232
I am so pleased that you are that hard
working and filial

33
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:56,069
Listen to me, I am notorious of being
a spendthrift

34
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,697
My fortune is almost used up

35
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:01,783
If I die one day,

36
00:04:01,867 --> 00:04:03,160
you should depend on yourself

37
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,536
I used to depend on myself

38
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:07,998
The cheques worth 100,000 taels!
Don't be an extravagant spender

39
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,375
Give me the imported hat

40
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:11,293
Where are you going? Chan!

41
00:04:12,461 --> 00:04:13,712
I am having a grand birthday party tonight

42
00:04:14,546 --> 00:04:15,172
How old are you?

43
00:04:15,464 --> 00:04:17,632
25 years old. Come earlier

44
00:04:18,717 --> 00:04:20,927
But you should dress up first

45
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:22,596
You are like beggar!

46
00:04:23,013 --> 00:04:25,182
How can a beggar be that rich?!
I do want to be a rich beggar!

47
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:29,728
That fat-headed…

48
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:30,771
Come over here

49
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:32,022
What's the matter?

50
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:35,317
The invitation card of my son is great!

51
00:04:35,734 --> 00:04:38,361
If I hold a birthday party in future,
I want a better invitation card!

52
00:04:57,714 --> 00:05:00,967
Your Majesty, how do you think about
the Cantonese Opera?

53
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:05,013
For sure, it can't compete with Peking Opera!

54
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:07,849
But, I am appreciated to view this

55
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:16,233
Money…

56
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:17,776
Happy birthday to you, Mr So

57
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:20,153
I am homeless and sick…

58
00:05:20,195 --> 00:05:23,907
I am poor, I am damn poor!

59
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:25,575
- Please give me some money
- Kidding? Damn you beggar!

60
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:28,662
How can you beg here?

61
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:29,913
Go to hell!

62
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:31,706
- Give him tips
- Yes, young master

63
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:34,417
Are you kidding? How can you give him tips?

64
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:36,545
A beggar is a man too

65
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:38,213
Everyone can come here
if he has money

66
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:39,297
Your living,

67
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:41,550
including the expenditure for hooking,
I will pay for you!

68
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:42,509
You pay it?

69
00:05:42,551 --> 00:05:43,343
So what?

70
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:46,596
Nothing!

71
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:49,224
- Come into my room…
- Please follow me.

72
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:53,228
Mr So!

73
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:54,396
Hello…

74
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:55,522
How are you, Madam Pimp?

75
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:58,149
It's very bad of you to call me that!

76
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,651
Just be frank, why not?

77
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:00,819
You should be frank!

78
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:03,780
Your hat, is like the mourning uniform!

79
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:04,906
Is your dad passed away?

80
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:09,119
I feel happy to talk in this way

81
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:12,914
Mr Chiu, you helped me to terminate
the Hairy Gang,

82
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:15,417
the emperor will give you award for this

83
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:17,878
I'll appreciate it if you

84
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:19,212
speak something nice in front of the emperor

85
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:22,465
Please have the towel

86
00:06:25,844 --> 00:06:28,013
Mr So has come

87
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:30,849
Congratulation!

88
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:31,850
This way…

89
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:34,269
Mr So, today is your big day,
you must be very happy!

90
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:36,646
We have some new girls,
you must be satisfied with it

91
00:06:36,688 --> 00:06:37,772
What are they? Gold fish, or cooked fish?

92
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:39,941
What does that mean?

93
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:41,776
You idiot! Gold fish is for watching only

94
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:43,486
Cooked fish can be eaten

95
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:45,906
Cooked fish of course

96
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:48,325
You, cooked fishes, why don't you
come and serve Mr So?

97
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:51,161
Mr So, you are the superior master today

98
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:53,288
What kind of woman do you want? Just tell me

99
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:55,749
I won't mind, every women is just the same

100
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,000
Nothing special

101
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:04,090
Mr So, what's the matter?

102
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:05,926
I am attacked

103
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:06,676
What?

104
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:08,386
Who dared so? I will hit that
bastard's mouth for you

105
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:09,137
She didn't use her mouth

106
00:07:09,471 --> 00:07:10,221
She used her eyes

107
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:13,934
Tempting, and I smell blood
I haven't seen such eyesight before

108
00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:16,019
Who is she?

109
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:18,188
Miss Yushang comes to be part time hooker only

110
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:20,190
Is Mr Chiu interested to sleep with her?

111
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:21,691
You should ask His Majesty first

112
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:23,234
How is it? Your Majesty?

113
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:26,613
We are friends, just go ahead if you want!

114
00:07:27,072 --> 00:07:28,573
Mr Chiu, help yourself

115
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:30,367
Thank you then

116
00:07:30,742 --> 00:07:31,576
The room service please

117
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:35,372
Yushang, come and greet Mr Chiu

118
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:39,042
Sister, he is the one we want

119
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:40,418
He killed dad

120
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:41,836
I know, stay calm

121
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:42,587
Let's go

122
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:44,130
- May I be excused
- Mr Chiu

123
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,715
Miss Yushang has arrived

124
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:52,097
How are you? Mr Chiu

125
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:57,936
A pretty woman!

126
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:02,565
Mr Chiu, about tonight…

127
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:04,067
100,000 taels

128
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:07,028
if Miss Yushang sleeps with our
young master tonight…

129
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:08,571
You are not welcomed

130
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:11,199
I am sorry, I am damn sorry

131
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:12,659
Don't you have any objection?

132
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:16,371
Let me say something fair

133
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:19,124
If any of you can offer more than 100,000 taels

134
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:20,834
Yushang will sleep with whom

135
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:24,004
Don't quarrel because of such
small amount, isn't it right?

136
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,880
Pal, you are a big spender

137
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:29,134
The cheque is too simple to me

138
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:35,098
I have a pearl which is granted by the
Royal family, it's invaluable!

139
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:39,853
I love the pearl more

140
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:44,482
Mr Chiu, I will wait you in my room

141
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:46,901
Does the pearl worth 100,000 taels?

142
00:08:47,736 --> 00:08:49,779
Don't you think that's too little for you?

143
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:53,992
I love money too. But, I don't like you

144
00:08:57,287 --> 00:08:59,873
You are frank! I love it very much

145
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:00,749
Mr So…

146
00:09:00,749 --> 00:09:01,750
It doesn't matter,

147
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:03,877
I think, my hat doesn't match me

148
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:06,755
Yushang doesn't like me, I deserve it

149
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:08,048
I am glad you understand this

150
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:10,341
Don't worry, I have many pretty girls here

151
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:13,678
I trust your arrangement

152
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:17,974
None of my business

153
00:09:18,016 --> 00:09:19,642
How bold are you?

154
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:31,112
Mantis Fist? It seems to be powerful

155
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:32,238
Music!

156
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:40,872
Keep this

157
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:42,791
See my Crane's Fists!

158
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:43,666
The Tiger's Claws!

159
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:51,841
How can a mantis fight with a tiger?

160
00:09:52,467 --> 00:09:54,135
I know Tiger Claws and Crane's Fists too!

161
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:57,597
Well, try my mantis!

162
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:12,695
Bravo…

163
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:15,573
Your Tiger's claws are defeated

164
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:18,827
Actually it's not Tiger's Claws,

165
00:10:18,827 --> 00:10:20,203
it's beggar's fists!

166
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:21,871
That's why it's too weak

167
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:29,129
You move fast!

168
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:30,880
It seems to be powerful…

169
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:35,802
Kid, you don't know how the wind blows

170
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:44,185
The general of Canton has arrived

171
00:10:44,227 --> 00:10:45,520
Get lost…

172
00:10:47,272 --> 00:10:49,524
Who dares bully my son, let me teach him a lesson

173
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:50,900
Master

174
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:52,735
Don't panic, Chan who bullied you?

175
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:53,486
It's me who bullied others

176
00:10:53,528 --> 00:10:55,196
What? You bullied others?

177
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:57,323
How much does he have?
Is he qualified to be bullied by you?

178
00:10:57,574 --> 00:10:58,575
Master, they are the ones

179
00:10:58,575 --> 00:10:59,284
Who are they?

180
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:00,660
Just take a look

181
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:04,247
The King of Iron Hat?

182
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:07,959
Send the gift

183
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:08,459
Chan

184
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,753
They send you such a valuable present,
you'd stop bullying them

185
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,589
- Come on, give tips to the girl here
- Master

186
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:15,425
King of Iron Hat, Seng-ko-lin-ch'in
is written on the medal

187
00:11:25,977 --> 00:11:27,520
How dare you seize the medal of His Majesty?

188
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:28,313
Cuff him

189
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:31,065
Hold it, according to the Ching's law,

190
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:33,610
Courtier is not allowed hooking up.

191
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:35,236
Now, you are in the brothel

192
00:11:35,445 --> 00:11:37,280
Do you know you have violated the laws of Ching?

193
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:38,698
How about you?

194
00:11:39,157 --> 00:11:40,283
- You mean me?
- Yes!

195
00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:42,452
That's right, I come…

196
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:43,286
- to arrest…
- You!

197
00:11:43,286 --> 00:11:44,954
- Him!
- Arrest him

198
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:46,664
I am the general of Canton,

199
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:49,167
so I should arrest those bad people

200
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:50,168
By the way…

201
00:11:50,168 --> 00:11:52,003
What else? Go ahead

202
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:55,590
Today is the birthday of the Ex-Empress Dowager

203
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:57,842
So your crime is doubled

204
00:11:57,842 --> 00:11:58,885
It may lead to capital punishment.

205
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:01,137
Kill him…

206
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:06,976
According to the Ching laws,

207
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:09,312
anyone without a tail should be killed

208
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:11,147
So you…

209
00:12:13,775 --> 00:12:14,776
Do you want to see my hair?

210
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:16,361
You can see as much as you want! Fat-headed

211
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:18,988
Cut the crap, just kill him

212
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:21,241
OK, it's finished

213
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:23,785
General So, let's play happily together,
so forget it

214
00:12:24,035 --> 00:12:25,328
I haven't played!

215
00:12:26,037 --> 00:12:26,496
Your Majesty,

216
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:28,831
a rascal has ruined the atmosphere here,

217
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:30,041
I should be blamed for poor arrangement

218
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:31,501
None of your business

219
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:33,211
Let's go

220
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:38,883
Master, you can't fool this guy. Let's go

221
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:40,510
OK, go

222
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:44,138
Just forget the trouble

223
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:49,310
Young master, your hat

224
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:56,985
He is great!
