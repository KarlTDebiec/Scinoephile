1
00:01:43,312 --> 00:01:44,646
Young master, we are ready

2
00:02:26,021 --> 00:02:26,647
What's a hard job for you, young master

3
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:28,190
The towel, young master

4
00:02:37,074 --> 00:02:38,367
What did he write?

5
00:02:38,617 --> 00:02:39,493
His name!

6
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:44,039
Great! Young master knows how to
write his name!

7
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:45,749
Yes!

8
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:52,172
Nice calligraphy

9
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,466
Get lost

10
00:02:56,635 --> 00:03:01,765
Nice calligraphy! So Cha Ha Yee Chan!

11
00:03:01,932 --> 00:03:02,766
It's reversed, Master

12
00:03:03,392 --> 00:03:05,060
Chan Yee Ha Cha So

13
00:03:05,227 --> 00:03:09,022
Good boy, but, don't be proud! Got me?

14
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:13,860
Dad, since the first
emperor of the Ching Dynasty,

15
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:15,654
our family

16
00:03:15,654 --> 00:03:17,447
has been illiterate

17
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:20,742
But not, my son, that's your grandson,

18
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:22,536
he knows how to write his name!

19
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:25,872
Dad, it's very great!

20
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:27,916
He knows writing now,

21
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:29,710
he will be scholar one day

22
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,336
Now, he knows how to write his name,

23
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:33,088
he will have a son later

24
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:35,799
Young master, you should try hard to learn

25
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:38,051
Chan, I think, we should mount it

26
00:03:38,093 --> 00:03:38,719
OK

27
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,971
Professor, show it in some obvious places

28
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:42,222
By the way, one minute,

29
00:03:42,264 --> 00:03:45,100
why don't you carry it with traditional
decoration in the street?

30
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:46,393
Let's go!

31
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:48,812
Chan, come and sit…

32
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:52,232
I am so pleased that you are that hard
working and filial

33
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:56,069
Listen to me, I am notorious of being
a spendthrift

34
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,697
My fortune is almost used up

35
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:01,783
If I die one day,

36
00:04:01,867 --> 00:04:03,160
you should depend on yourself

37
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,536
I used to depend on myself

38
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:07,998
The cheques worth 100,000 taels!
Don't be an extravagant spender

39
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,375
Give me the imported hat

40
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:11,293
Where are you going? Chan!

41
00:04:12,461 --> 00:04:13,712
I am having a grand birthday party tonight

42
00:04:14,546 --> 00:04:15,172
How old are you?

43
00:04:15,464 --> 00:04:17,632
25 years old. Come earlier

44
00:04:18,717 --> 00:04:20,927
But you should dress up first

45
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:22,596
You are like beggar!

46
00:04:23,013 --> 00:04:25,182
How can a beggar be that rich?!
I do want to be a rich beggar!

47
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:29,728
That fat-headed…

48
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:30,771
Come over here

49
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:32,022
What's the matter?

50
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:35,317
The invitation card of my son is great!

51
00:04:35,734 --> 00:04:38,361
If I hold a birthday party in future,
I want a better invitation card!

52
00:04:57,714 --> 00:05:00,967
Your Majesty, how do you think about
the Cantonese Opera?

53
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:05,013
For sure, it can't compete with Peking Opera!

54
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:07,849
But, I am appreciated to view this

55
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:16,233
Money…

56
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:17,776
Happy birthday to you, Mr So

57
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:20,153
I am homeless and sick…

58
00:05:20,195 --> 00:05:23,907
I am poor, I am damn poor!

59
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:25,575
- Please give me some money
- Kidding? Damn you beggar!

60
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:28,662
How can you beg here?

61
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:29,913
Go to hell!

62
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:31,706
- Give him tips
- Yes, young master

63
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:34,417
Are you kidding? How can you give him tips?

64
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:36,545
A beggar is a man too

65
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:38,213
Everyone can come here
if he has money

66
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:39,297
Your living,

67
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:41,550
including the expenditure for hooking,
I will pay for you!

68
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:42,509
You pay it?

69
00:05:42,551 --> 00:05:43,343
So what?

70
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:46,596
Nothing!

71
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:49,224
- Come into my room…
- Please follow me.

72
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:53,228
Mr So!

73
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:54,396
Hello…

74
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:55,522
How are you, Madam Pimp?

75
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:58,149
It's very bad of you to call me that!

76
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,651
Just be frank, why not?

77
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:00,819
You should be frank!

78
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:03,780
Your hat, is like the mourning uniform!

79
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:04,906
Is your dad passed away?

80
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:09,119
I feel happy to talk in this way

81
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:12,914
Mr Chiu, you helped me to terminate
the Hairy Gang,

82
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:15,417
the emperor will give you award for this

83
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:17,878
I'll appreciate it if you

84
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:19,212
speak something nice in front of the emperor

85
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:22,465
Please have the towel

86
00:06:25,844 --> 00:06:28,013
Mr So has come

87
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:30,849
Congratulation!

88
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:31,850
This way…

89
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:34,269
Mr So, today is your big day,
you must be very happy!

90
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:36,646
We have some new girls,
you must be satisfied with it

91
00:06:36,688 --> 00:06:37,772
What are they? Gold fish, or cooked fish?

92
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:39,941
What does that mean?

93
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:41,776
You idiot! Gold fish is for watching only

94
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:43,486
Cooked fish can be eaten

95
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:45,906
Cooked fish of course

96
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:48,325
You, cooked fishes, why don't you
come and serve Mr So?

97
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:51,161
Mr So, you are the superior master today

98
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:53,288
What kind of woman do you want? Just tell me

99
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:55,749
I won't mind, every women is just the same

100
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,000
Nothing special

101
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:04,090
Mr So, what's the matter?

102
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:05,926
I am attacked

103
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:06,676
What?

104
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:08,386
Who dared so? I will hit that
bastard's mouth for you

105
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:09,137
She didn't use her mouth

106
00:07:09,471 --> 00:07:10,221
She used her eyes

107
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:13,934
Tempting, and I smell blood
I haven't seen such eyesight before

108
00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:16,019
Who is she?

109
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:18,188
Miss Yushang comes to be part time hooker only

110
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:20,190
Is Mr Chiu interested to sleep with her?

111
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:21,691
You should ask His Majesty first

112
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:23,234
How is it? Your Majesty?

113
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:26,613
We are friends, just go ahead if you want!

114
00:07:27,072 --> 00:07:28,573
Mr Chiu, help yourself

115
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:30,367
Thank you then

116
00:07:30,742 --> 00:07:31,576
The room service please

117
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:35,372
Yushang, come and greet Mr Chiu

118
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:39,042
Sister, he is the one we want

119
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:40,418
He killed dad

120
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:41,836
I know, stay calm

121
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:42,587
Let's go

122
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:44,130
- May I be excused
- Mr Chiu

123
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,715
Miss Yushang has arrived

124
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:52,097
How are you? Mr Chiu

125
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:57,936
A pretty woman!

126
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:02,565
Mr Chiu, about tonight…

127
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:04,067
100,000 taels

128
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:07,028
if Miss Yushang sleeps with our
young master tonight…

129
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:08,571
You are not welcomed

130
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:11,199
I am sorry, I am damn sorry

131
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:12,659
Don't you have any objection?

132
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:16,371
Let me say something fair

133
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:19,124
If any of you can offer more than 100,000 taels

134
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:20,834
Yushang will sleep with whom

135
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:24,004
Don't quarrel because of such
small amount, isn't it right?

136
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,880
Pal, you are a big spender

137
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:29,134
The cheque is too simple to me

138
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:35,098
I have a pearl which is granted by the
Royal family, it's invaluable!

139
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:39,853
I love the pearl more

140
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:44,482
Mr Chiu, I will wait you in my room

141
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:46,901
Does the pearl worth 100,000 taels?

142
00:08:47,736 --> 00:08:49,779
Don't you think that's too little for you?

143
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:53,992
I love money too. But, I don't like you

144
00:08:57,287 --> 00:08:59,873
You are frank! I love it very much

145
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:00,749
Mr So…

146
00:09:00,749 --> 00:09:01,750
It doesn't matter,

147
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:03,877
I think, my hat doesn't match me

148
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:06,755
Yushang doesn't like me, I deserve it

149
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:08,048
I am glad you understand this

150
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:10,341
Don't worry, I have many pretty girls here

151
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:13,678
I trust your arrangement

152
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:17,974
None of my business

153
00:09:18,016 --> 00:09:19,642
How bold are you?

154
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:31,112
Mantis Fist? It seems to be powerful

155
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:32,238
Music!

156
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:40,872
Keep this

157
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:42,791
See my Crane's Fists!

158
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:43,666
The Tiger's Claws!

159
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:51,841
How can a mantis fight with a tiger?

160
00:09:52,467 --> 00:09:54,135
I know Tiger Claws and Crane's Fists too!

161
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:57,597
Well, try my mantis!

162
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:12,695
Bravo…

163
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:15,573
Your Tiger's claws are defeated

164
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:18,827
Actually it's not Tiger's Claws,

165
00:10:18,827 --> 00:10:20,203
it's beggar's fists!

166
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:21,871
That's why it's too weak

167
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:29,129
You move fast!

168
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:30,880
It seems to be powerful…

169
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:35,802
Kid, you don't know how the wind blows

170
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:44,185
The general of Canton has arrived

171
00:10:44,227 --> 00:10:45,520
Get lost…

172
00:10:47,272 --> 00:10:49,524
Who dares bully my son, let me teach him a lesson

173
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:50,900
Master

174
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:52,735
Don't panic, Chan who bullied you?

175
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:53,486
It's me who bullied others

176
00:10:53,528 --> 00:10:55,196
What? You bullied others?

177
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:57,323
How much does he have?
Is he qualified to be bullied by you?

178
00:10:57,574 --> 00:10:58,575
Master, they are the ones

179
00:10:58,575 --> 00:10:59,284
Who are they?

180
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:00,660
Just take a look

181
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:04,247
The King of Iron Hat?

182
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:07,959
Send the gift

183
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:08,459
Chan

184
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,753
They send you so valuable present,
you'd stop bullying them

185
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,589
- Come on, give tips to the girl here
- Master

186
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:15,425
King of Iron Hat, Seng-ko-lin-ch'in
is written on the medal

187
00:11:25,977 --> 00:11:27,520
How dare you seize the medal of His Majesty?

188
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:28,313
Cuff him

189
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:31,065
Hold it, according to the Ching's law,

190
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:33,610
Courtier is not allowed hooking

191
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:35,236
Now, you are in the brothel

192
00:11:35,445 --> 00:11:37,280
Do you know you have committed the laws of Ching?

193
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:38,698
How about you?

194
00:11:39,157 --> 00:11:40,283
- You mean me?
- Yes!

195
00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:42,452
That's right, I come…

196
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:43,286
- to arrest…
- You!

197
00:11:43,286 --> 00:11:44,954
- Him!
- Arrest him

198
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:46,664
I am the general of Canton,

199
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:49,167
so I should arrest those bad people

200
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:50,168
By the way…

201
00:11:50,168 --> 00:11:52,003
What else? Go ahead

202
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:55,590
Today is the birthday of the Ex-Empress Dowager

203
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:57,842
So your crime is doubled

204
00:11:57,842 --> 00:11:58,885
It may cause to capital punishment

205
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:01,137
Kill him…

206
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:06,976
According to the Ching laws,

207
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:09,312
anyone without a tail should be killed

208
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:11,147
So you…

209
00:12:13,775 --> 00:12:14,776
Do you want to see my hair?

210
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:16,361
You can see as much as you want! Fat-headed

211
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:18,988
Cut the crap, just kill him

212
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:21,241
OK, it's finished

213
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:23,785
General So, let's play happily together,
so forget it

214
00:12:24,035 --> 00:12:25,328
I haven't played!

215
00:12:26,037 --> 00:12:26,496
Your Majesty,

216
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:28,831
a rascal has ruined the atmosphere here,

217
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:30,041
I should be blamed for poor arrangement

218
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:31,501
None of your business

219
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:33,211
Let's go

220
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:38,883
Master, you can't fool this guy. Let's go

221
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:40,510
OK, go

222
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:44,138
Just forget the trouble

223
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:49,310
Young master, your hat

224
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:56,985
He is great!

225
00:13:06,077 --> 00:13:09,080
Uncle Mok, the dishes are all poisoned

226
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:13,167
Chiu assassinated our Master

227
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:14,919
and some generals of The Taiping Reign

228
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:17,005
And he framed us, the Beggars Association,
to be the assassinators

229
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:19,340
Thus made us

230
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:20,925
being despised by the world

231
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:23,303
Saying that we became the dogs of the government

232
00:13:23,845 --> 00:13:25,888
I should ask him to pay for it

233
00:13:27,557 --> 00:13:29,100
His initial power is harmful

234
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:31,561
Don't take action until he is trapped

235
00:13:31,853 --> 00:13:34,147
Because we can't defeat him even
we group together

236
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:36,316
I will try my best to seduce him to the bed

237
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:38,860
Senior, somebody is coming

238
00:13:39,402 --> 00:13:40,445
Get ready…

239
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:50,621
Miss Yushang, we meet again

240
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:52,665
Why do you come here? Where is Mister Chiu?

241
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:54,208
The pearl of Mr Chiu is broken

242
00:13:54,292 --> 00:13:56,044
by Mr So and become pearl powder

243
00:13:56,044 --> 00:13:57,337
I have drunk it

244
00:13:58,212 --> 00:14:00,048
Don't judge Mr So from his hair,

245
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,633
he is really romantic and funny

246
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:03,551
But…

247
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:06,054
Stop, I have taken his money,
100,000 taels you know?

248
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:07,764
I won't give it back

249
00:14:08,306 --> 00:14:09,724
About the personality of Mr So…

250
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:11,309
Cut the crap, pimp!

251
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:12,310
Leave here first

252
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:13,519
Yes, you are right

253
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:15,938
- Miss Seven…
- Just accept this

254
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:21,652
Who is this guy?

255
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:23,237
I don't know

256
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:26,574
Miss, first of all, I have a good news to you

257
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,076
I love you

258
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:31,454
To me, this is a bad news

259
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,539
I know you will reply like this

260
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:34,832
Cut the crap

261
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:36,209
I wish to pay you 100 pearls

262
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:39,128
for you your company tonight

263
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,505
I don't want to talk to you

264
00:14:40,505 --> 00:14:41,547
Please get out

265
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:44,592
I haven't chosen a wrong one

266
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:46,844
OK, I will drink this wine first

267
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:48,346
No…

268
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:56,854
It surprised me

269
00:14:58,022 --> 00:14:58,648
Miss

270
00:14:58,940 --> 00:14:59,899
Hands off!

271
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:03,152
You know Kung-fu?

272
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:05,780
No, I don't know Kung-fu at all

273
00:15:06,197 --> 00:15:07,782
I beg you, stop bothering me

274
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:09,033
I won't accompany you

275
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:12,161
Yushang, no one treats me like this

276
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:14,372
I have found that I am in love with you

277
00:15:16,207 --> 00:15:17,083
What?

278
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,212
I have been in love with you

279
00:15:22,213 --> 00:15:23,464
Are you kidding?

280
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:26,426
I am not kidding, I decided to marry you

281
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:28,719
Are you nuts?

282
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:30,972
Kidding?

283
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:35,852
Are there anyone hiding here?

284
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:41,065
That's good, I want a witness

285
00:15:41,232 --> 00:15:42,567
- Witness?
- Yes

286
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:44,861
I swear in front of your sword

287
00:15:45,153 --> 00:15:46,904
I do want to marry Miss Yushang
as my wife, I am sincere

288
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:49,157
If I cheat, I will be killed by thunder

289
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:52,452
Sister, I feel excited for you

290
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:53,661
Hey

291
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:56,706
Don't you know it's that easy to be my husband?

292
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:58,624
How can I be your husband?

293
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:02,086
I want him to be the superior Kung-fu master

294
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:03,504
Be the top of all

295
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:04,839
Can you do that?

296
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:06,507
Let me think for one second

297
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:13,931
I can do it

298
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:17,059
OK

299
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:19,520
Do it first and then look for me

300
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:23,399
Well, I think we should fix a date for our wedding

301
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:26,694
Because, this is too easy to me
to be the Kung-fu scholar!

302
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:30,781
OK, but you'd give me some time to consider it

303
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:33,701
No problem, I will wait for your answer
outside the garden

304
00:16:34,452 --> 00:16:35,786
I won't leave until seeing you

305
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:41,459
Crazy!

306
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:07,276
We come for the Beggars Association,
those unrelated persons leave at once

307
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:06,544
Sir, the timing is fit

308
00:18:07,003 --> 00:18:09,213
The road is safe now, please go

309
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:13,217
Good, very good

310
00:18:15,386 --> 00:18:16,470
Let's go!

311
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:31,861
Shit, we are late

312
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:34,363
That Manchurian should be blamed

313
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:43,372
Sister…

314
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:43,914
What's the matter?

315
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:45,541
The idiot is still there

316
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:46,959
Let's kill him

317
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:49,420
Forget it, he doesn't mean to bother us

318
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:50,713
Let him go

319
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:04,560
Are you fond of him?

320
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:06,312
What did you say?

321
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:07,772
I won't fall in love with anybody

322
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,649
until Chiu is killed

323
00:19:10,066 --> 00:19:11,067
Especially him

324
00:19:11,901 --> 00:19:13,778
Chiu is good at Kung-fu

325
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:17,031
Mok said, we can't defeat him unless
using the "Dragon Killing Palms"

326
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,617
So, I can never marry!

327
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:22,244
Let's go, if you want to marry

328
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,848
What evil are you? How dare you scare me?

329
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:47,228
Mr So, it's me!

330
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:49,814
You are the pimp?!

331
00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:50,940
Yes!

332
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:52,733
You have flat figure, where are your busts?

333
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:55,903
It's early in the morning,
they haven't waken up yet

334
00:19:56,237 --> 00:19:57,780
It's lucky of you for not being killed

335
00:19:57,947 --> 00:19:59,615
Don't go around if you haven't made up yet

336
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,158
I won't do it again

337
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:05,746
Stop waiting for Miss Yushang, she left

338
00:20:06,247 --> 00:20:07,081
What?

339
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:12,962
Where is she going?

340
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:17,675
She… she is going to Peking

341
00:20:18,134 --> 00:20:19,093
Peking?

342
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:24,557
Men should contribute to the country

343
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:28,644
Where should I put my pig-tail?

344
00:20:28,811 --> 00:20:30,730
Swing and swing…

345
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:32,773
I pull it and play it…

346
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:34,233
Dad!

347
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:36,485
I decided to join the examination for the
scholar of Martial Arts

348
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:38,154
Chan

349
00:20:38,863 --> 00:20:40,740
I have been longing for this word for 25 years

350
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,867
For the family of us, you should do that

351
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:44,869
Don't misunderstand it, I do it not for no one

352
00:20:44,869 --> 00:20:45,619
But for a woman

353
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:46,787
What a hero!

354
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:49,665
For a girl, you want to be the scholar
of Martial Arts!

355
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:50,583
Who is that girl?

356
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:53,127
The hooker of Yee Hung Brothel, Miss Yushang

357
00:20:53,294 --> 00:20:54,503
For a hooker?

358
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:56,547
What's wrong with it?

359
00:20:57,757 --> 00:21:00,384
You have different taste, you are great!

360
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:01,510
I am admiring you!

361
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:02,470
I will accompany you to Peking

362
00:21:02,845 --> 00:21:04,013
2, 3, 4, 5, 6

363
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:06,474
I am coming

364
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:09,059
Young master is going for the examination,
let's move to Peking too

365
00:21:10,895 --> 00:21:12,646
Stop chasing,

366
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:15,107
we won't take the hens with us

367
00:21:16,192 --> 00:21:18,319
Be careful!

368
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:21,030
If you break my stuff,
I will teach you good lesson

369
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,573
Be careful!

370
00:21:23,491 --> 00:21:24,116
Good morning dad

371
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:24,909
Good morning

372
00:21:24,909 --> 00:21:25,868
You want to move everything to Peking?

373
00:21:25,868 --> 00:21:26,702
Sure

374
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:28,537
Please leave me a clothe

375
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:30,498
You are only a kid, you don't need this

376
00:21:30,581 --> 00:21:31,957
But I am not small

377
00:21:33,167 --> 00:21:35,669
Are you bigger than mine?

378
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:36,587
You despise me!

379
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:38,214
Mine will be bigger than yours one day

380
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:40,841
Let's find something, say trousers to cover it

381
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:42,051
I don't want to see it

382
00:21:42,885 --> 00:21:45,095
Why are you standing here for?
Why don't you remove it?

383
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:47,932
It's a hard job to remove such a big house!

384
00:21:47,932 --> 00:21:49,725
Please, work hard men!

385
00:21:49,892 --> 00:21:53,604
Ready, 1, 2, 3, push!

386
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:57,107
Push!

387
00:21:57,608 --> 00:21:58,776
Be careful!

388
00:21:59,068 --> 00:22:00,694
Tie it well…

389
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,154
Master, do you want to move the tree too?

390
00:22:02,363 --> 00:22:03,280
Sure,

391
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,324
or how can I eat Lychee in Peking?

392
00:22:06,075 --> 00:22:07,701
Push it over…

393
00:22:08,536 --> 00:22:11,956
Be careful

394
00:22:12,081 --> 00:22:14,750
Take care of my Lychee, you fat headed!

395
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:17,628
Chiu helped me to terminate

396
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:21,757
the Hairy Gang in Kwangsi

397
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:24,593
So I bring him here to greet Your Majesty

398
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:30,933
Fine, I am now appointing you to be
the Deputy Secretary

399
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:35,271
Hope you will serve our Ching Dynasty
whole-heartedly

400
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:36,689
Thank you, Your Majesty

401
00:22:36,981 --> 00:22:40,276
Your Majesty, Mr Chiu is a magician

402
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:43,571
Why don't you ask him to show you something?

403
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:44,947
Magic?

404
00:22:47,116 --> 00:22:50,077
Mr Chiu, then show me your magic

405
00:22:50,703 --> 00:22:51,704
Yes, Your Majesty

406
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:08,257
There is nothing surprising, go

407
00:25:08,257 --> 00:25:09,341
Yes

408
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:25,733
I am sorry for scaring you

409
00:25:26,734 --> 00:25:28,527
If this girl is real, that's fantastic!

410
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:31,864
Hurry up!

411
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:34,700
What's the matter?

412
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:36,660
Come on, go in

413
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:40,998
What's the matter?

414
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:43,542
Hide in

415
00:25:45,002 --> 00:25:46,003
Get ready, young master

416
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:47,838
Come on

417
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:50,716
Freeze, don't move

418
00:25:55,345 --> 00:25:58,098
Sweet smell, are you Piu Hung?

419
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:01,268
You are great! I love it

420
00:26:01,935 --> 00:26:02,895
Closer

421
00:26:04,021 --> 00:26:06,774
So big! You must be Small!

422
00:26:07,775 --> 00:26:09,318
You are bad, how can you say so to me?

423
00:26:09,318 --> 00:26:10,778
You are big!

424
00:26:13,155 --> 00:26:15,657
What? Pregnant woman? You can't cheat me

425
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:16,617
You are dad

426
00:26:17,493 --> 00:26:20,162
How bad are you, how can you guess that?

427
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:21,497
Good boy

428
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:26,043
I wanted to trick you actually,
you are really smart

429
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:29,463
Young master has to join the examination tomorrow,

430
00:26:29,463 --> 00:26:30,297
stop playing

431
00:26:30,339 --> 00:26:31,548
Get out…

432
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:34,593
Chan, have you prepared

433
00:26:34,635 --> 00:26:35,761
for your examination?

434
00:26:35,761 --> 00:26:38,514
What should I prepare?
I must win, don't you know that?

435
00:26:38,806 --> 00:26:40,516
Yes I do!

436
00:26:40,516 --> 00:26:43,310
I have faith in you from seeing your behaviour!

437
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:45,854
Chan, this is Uncle Cheng

438
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:47,397
He will be the examiner

439
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:48,482
Say hello to Uncle Cheng

440
00:26:49,191 --> 00:26:51,401
How are you, Uncle Cheng?

441
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:55,572
See

442
00:26:55,906 --> 00:26:58,283
Doesn't he seem to be the winner?

443
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:00,577
It depends on the fate

444
00:27:01,578 --> 00:27:03,872
Cheng, I've asked someone

445
00:27:03,997 --> 00:27:05,249
to finish the papers which you gave me

446
00:27:05,541 --> 00:27:06,500
Will the questions be changed?

447
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:08,710
Don't worry about the question paper

448
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:10,587
But about the test of arrows shooting,

449
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:12,172
riding, boxing and weapons…

450
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:13,465
He should try his best

451
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:14,341
Don't worry

452
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:17,010
My son is keen in martial arts

453
00:27:17,928 --> 00:27:20,264
So, can I deduct some from the payment
of 2 million taels?

454
00:27:20,806 --> 00:27:23,183
We are friends, but that is business

455
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:34,236
Let the Horse teams be the pioneer

456
00:27:34,444 --> 00:27:36,989
The arrows teams go side ways,
the gunmen stay back

457
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:13,984
The candidates come in

458
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:08,872
I can't lift it

459
00:29:12,042 --> 00:29:12,834
I don't want to waste my force

460
00:29:13,043 --> 00:29:16,046
Shameless? Damn you!

461
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,491
Oh, 10 marks

462
00:31:09,785 --> 00:31:12,704
The final race now starts

463
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:14,915
The candidates,

464
00:31:15,165 --> 00:31:17,167
Po Ye Tat Tor from Mongolia

465
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:19,211
Bravo…

466
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:24,049
And So Cha Ha Yee Chan from Canton

467
00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:27,969
Last call

468
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:31,431
So, one to ten Po, one to one

469
00:31:32,432 --> 00:31:35,477
Are you kidding, how can the betting rates
differ so much?

470
00:31:35,769 --> 00:31:38,021
One to ten for Chan? Kidding?

471
00:31:38,397 --> 00:31:40,065
Why don't you have faith in Chan?

472
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:44,319
That is, Chan defaulted in weight lifting

473
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:47,823
Look, Po entered the final race

474
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:51,034
with full marks, it differs

475
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:53,954
It's an examination of the Scholar of
Martial Arts, not king of coolie

476
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:55,956
It's meaningless to be the champion
of weight lifting

477
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:57,624
- You shouldn't put it that way
- What?

478
00:31:57,666 --> 00:31:59,751
He is smart

479
00:32:00,794 --> 00:32:02,170
I've studied this race for a long time

480
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:03,964
I feel strange about the rate too

481
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:07,801
Po is smart and strong

482
00:32:08,093 --> 00:32:10,679
But see the sweat of his neck

483
00:32:11,138 --> 00:32:13,098
I think it's because he is getting tired

484
00:32:13,098 --> 00:32:13,974
Really?

485
00:32:14,683 --> 00:32:16,518
But this So

486
00:32:16,518 --> 00:32:17,185
What do you thing?

487
00:32:17,227 --> 00:32:18,603
He has been disappointing the audience

488
00:32:19,104 --> 00:32:21,440
But he has achieved very hard

489
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:23,233
What?

490
00:32:23,692 --> 00:32:26,653
He tried very hard

491
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:29,114
So I want to bet on him

492
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:31,491
How much do you want to bet?

493
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:32,784
800,000 taels

494
00:32:33,118 --> 00:32:35,954
Why not 2 million taels?

495
00:32:36,413 --> 00:32:38,415
What? Why are you so optimistic about Chan?

496
00:32:38,415 --> 00:32:39,875
You have good analyse

497
00:32:39,875 --> 00:32:40,625
I feel Chan

498
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:42,669
will be the champion

499
00:32:44,254 --> 00:32:45,172
Come on

500
00:32:46,131 --> 00:32:47,382
I want to bet more on him

501
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:47,966
Really?

502
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:48,967
2 million taels!

503
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:51,303
How generous!

504
00:32:52,596 --> 00:32:53,555
Why don't you bet?

505
00:32:53,597 --> 00:32:56,349
Why should I bet? He is my son

506
00:32:57,684 --> 00:33:00,353
Shit, I miss one thing out of my calculation

507
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:01,480
What?

508
00:33:01,771 --> 00:33:02,522
The blood

509
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:07,027
Here comes the Examiner

510
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:11,281
What? Isn't Cheng the examiner?

511
00:33:15,202 --> 00:33:16,244
Please take a seat

512
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:20,582
Seng-ko-lin-ch'in?!

513
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:21,750
What's the problem?

514
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:25,712
He is the uncle of Po

515
00:33:27,797 --> 00:33:28,757
Let's start

516
00:33:33,303 --> 00:33:34,888
Start!

517
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:10,840
They should act 2 more marks for that
powerful shoot

518
00:34:10,924 --> 00:34:13,093
I do think so

519
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:19,391
So's arrow isn't on the target,
Po won this section

520
00:34:25,689 --> 00:34:28,817
Kidding? Damn you! They are cheating

521
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:35,240
The candidates please get on the horses

522
00:34:37,784 --> 00:34:38,785
Mr Chiu

523
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:45,959
Take these with you, may be you will
find them useful

524
00:34:46,251 --> 00:34:49,087
Here comes the 2nd round

525
00:35:19,284 --> 00:35:20,702
They trick again

526
00:35:21,286 --> 00:35:24,748
It's corrupt! May I give up the betting?

527
00:35:48,938 --> 00:35:50,440
Chan won this race

528
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:52,067
Did you tear the ticket?

529
00:35:52,108 --> 00:35:54,194
Not yet

530
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:08,249
Are you kidding?

531
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:11,730
Once again?!

532
00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:19,028
OK, let's start from the very beginning,
I'll fight with single hand and leg

533
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:20,363
I won't take your advantage

534
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:33,334
How can you use such dirty stance?

535
00:37:33,543 --> 00:37:35,253
Have you waken?

536
00:37:35,754 --> 00:37:37,589
Bravo! He won

537
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:39,799
Have some tea

538
00:37:39,799 --> 00:37:40,592
All the best!

539
00:37:41,176 --> 00:37:43,803
What did you say?

540
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:45,221
It's English

541
00:37:45,388 --> 00:37:46,556
It's English

542
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:48,683
There is no regulation stating that
weapon is not allowed

543
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:52,604
You fell down first, Po is the winner again

544
00:37:56,441 --> 00:37:59,569
Damn you Cheng! You betrayed me!

545
00:37:59,736 --> 00:38:01,029
I will beat you to death

546
00:38:01,029 --> 00:38:02,280
if I see you again

547
00:38:02,614 --> 00:38:04,157
Forget it, you won't see him anymore

548
00:38:04,157 --> 00:38:04,908
Why?

549
00:38:05,074 --> 00:38:06,034
I am now going to kill him!

550
00:38:06,034 --> 00:38:06,910
I don't have 2 million to lose!

551
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:10,079
Just kidding

552
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:11,456
You shameless

553
00:38:11,748 --> 00:38:16,711
Po is the Scholar of Martial Arts

554
00:38:16,795 --> 00:38:19,422
I did win! Objection

555
00:38:36,773 --> 00:38:37,524
What are you doing?

556
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:41,986
The dart is poisoned

557
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:46,074
He deserves it!

558
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:50,954
He was poisoned by his own dart

559
00:38:51,788 --> 00:38:53,915
Well, my son will be the Scholar then

560
00:38:53,915 --> 00:38:55,041
I am going to be rich!

561
00:38:55,124 --> 00:38:56,125
Yes!

562
00:38:56,376 --> 00:38:57,836
You… You…

563
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:07,262
Thank you, my ancestors!

564
00:39:07,512 --> 00:39:08,930
You have good judgement

565
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:13,852
Sir, His Majesty wants to
appoint the title himself

566
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:17,772
OK

567
00:39:21,234 --> 00:39:25,530
I want to take some statement from you as record

568
00:39:25,697 --> 00:39:28,408
You won this time, who are you going to thank?

569
00:39:28,408 --> 00:39:29,659
Miss Yushang!

570
00:39:30,451 --> 00:39:33,830
Is Miss Yushang his mom?

571
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:40,753
Long life to you!

572
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:41,921
Please get up

573
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:43,506
Thank you

574
00:39:44,966 --> 00:39:47,927
Who is the new Scholar of Martial Arts?

575
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:53,516
Your Majesty, So Chan from Canton
is the Scholar this year

576
00:39:56,436 --> 00:39:58,813
Your Majesty, I am So Cha Ha Yee Chan

577
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:03,067
Your Majesty, I want to report something

578
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:06,404
Go ahead

579
00:40:08,281 --> 00:40:10,491
I have found that. So is illiterate

580
00:40:10,783 --> 00:40:12,410
So how could he answer the
question paper of strategy?

581
00:40:12,577 --> 00:40:13,536
That should be tricks

582
00:40:18,166 --> 00:40:19,417
Take the stationery out!

583
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:20,418
Yes

584
00:40:25,214 --> 00:40:28,509
So Cha Ha Yee Chan, write your name now

585
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:33,097
Thank God, he knows how to write his name!

586
00:40:33,348 --> 00:40:35,141
He can write his name!

587
00:40:48,154 --> 00:40:48,905
I don't know how to write

588
00:40:51,074 --> 00:40:52,075
That's shit!

589
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:53,910
Kill him now

590
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:56,204
No! No!

591
00:40:57,997 --> 00:40:59,624
Your Majesty, I am the one who cheated

592
00:40:59,624 --> 00:41:00,583
It's none of his business

593
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:01,459
Just chop me to death

594
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:02,710
No, you should kill me

595
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:03,544
Sorry dad

596
00:41:03,586 --> 00:41:04,879
I don't know how to write my name

597
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:06,255
Stop, I have known it already

598
00:41:06,547 --> 00:41:07,590
Your Majesty, I should be killed

599
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:08,758
- Kill me
- No, kill me

600
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,677
- Kill me.
- Your Majesty, you'd better kill me

601
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:12,971
Shit, are you giving order?

602
00:41:13,554 --> 00:41:14,973
You two co-operated to cheat me

603
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:17,308
The Secretary for Justice,
announce the penalty for them

604
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:21,562
Come out! Hurry up

605
00:41:21,688 --> 00:41:23,815
I am here!

606
00:41:27,694 --> 00:41:29,028
He is the Secretary for Justice

607
00:41:29,529 --> 00:41:33,533
So's family should be sentenced to death

608
00:41:35,368 --> 00:41:38,121
But their ancestors achieved a lot
to Ching, they can be exampled

609
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:41,541
But, their fortune should be forfeited

610
00:41:42,125 --> 00:41:43,209
Have you carried out any military duty?

611
00:41:43,668 --> 00:41:46,295
I haven't gone back to my camp for
7 years, I haven't done anything

612
00:41:47,463 --> 00:41:50,049
So, he didn't miscarry out any duty

613
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:52,635
So, the maximum penalty

614
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:55,096
is forfeiture of property only

615
00:41:58,558 --> 00:42:00,643
What? Are you sure?

616
00:42:01,561 --> 00:42:02,812
I am fair

617
00:42:02,895 --> 00:42:05,440
I judge it from the Law Book

618
00:42:06,691 --> 00:42:08,443
Can I add something?

619
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:11,988
Sure, since you are the Emperor

620
00:42:12,113 --> 00:42:14,907
I want them to be beggars for the rest
of their lives

621
00:42:15,324 --> 00:42:16,367
Why couldn't you find out

622
00:42:16,451 --> 00:42:17,744
they cheated during the examination?

623
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:19,537
Luckily Chiu reported it to me on time

624
00:42:19,787 --> 00:42:22,832
Chiu, you would be rewarded

625
00:42:24,834 --> 00:42:28,963
I am wandering…

626
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:32,133
That's the spirit tablet of my dad,
do you want to take it too?

627
00:42:33,301 --> 00:42:35,219
It's useless for you

628
00:42:35,303 --> 00:42:45,438
How poor are we…

629
00:42:45,688 --> 00:42:52,028
I am thinking of my better half…

630
00:42:52,028 --> 00:42:53,112
Young master,

631
00:42:54,072 --> 00:42:55,406
from now on,

632
00:42:55,448 --> 00:42:57,158
you'd be hard working to learn how to write

633
00:43:00,912 --> 00:43:08,044
But I can't sell the affection…

634
00:43:11,547 --> 00:43:12,465
Professor

635
00:43:13,758 --> 00:43:14,717
I will learn it

636
00:43:15,885 --> 00:43:21,224
I regret that…

637
00:43:21,224 --> 00:43:24,185
Master, I will take good care of little turtle

638
00:43:24,227 --> 00:43:25,520
I am sorry

639
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:28,147
We haven't given birth to any baby of yours

640
00:43:28,189 --> 00:43:29,273
It doesn't matter

641
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,526
It's all my fault

642
00:43:31,567 --> 00:43:34,237
If I did better, you could have many babies

643
00:43:34,237 --> 00:43:37,073
But I think Chan is enough for me

644
00:43:38,491 --> 00:43:39,867
Why are you standing here? Go now

645
00:43:39,867 --> 00:43:41,327
Master, we are leaving

646
00:43:41,327 --> 00:43:42,537
We are leaving, master

647
00:43:42,537 --> 00:43:43,663
Go, go now

648
00:43:46,582 --> 00:43:47,792
We are free

649
00:43:48,084 --> 00:43:48,793
I feel so happy

650
00:43:48,793 --> 00:43:50,044
How happy are we!

651
00:43:54,757 --> 00:43:56,050
Go in…

652
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:57,176
Hurry up…

653
00:43:58,553 --> 00:44:01,430
Why are they so happy?

654
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:04,725
I am very happy

655
00:44:05,351 --> 00:44:06,352
Please go in…

656
00:44:06,352 --> 00:44:07,478
Welcome…

657
00:44:08,437 --> 00:44:11,524
Damn sequestration, I wanna cry, my son

658
00:44:11,524 --> 00:44:13,693
Hold it, don't lose our face

659
00:44:13,734 --> 00:44:14,610
Keep on laughing

660
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:20,116
Son. Have you kept any money?

661
00:44:20,116 --> 00:44:21,159
No, how about you?

662
00:44:21,409 --> 00:44:23,119
I forgot that

663
00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:29,292
Shit, damn sequestration!

664
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:35,756
Be merciful, please give money to us

665
00:44:35,756 --> 00:44:38,759
Son, that guy is like dad

666
00:44:39,177 --> 00:44:40,803
You mean the one who sings?

667
00:44:40,845 --> 00:44:42,555
No, the one who pays

668
00:44:42,597 --> 00:44:45,183
He is more disgusting than the one who sings

669
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:48,060
Not exactly, he is smart

670
00:44:48,352 --> 00:44:50,521
Dad should be blamed

671
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:52,648
I always called you beggar

672
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:53,608
Now, it becomes true

673
00:44:53,649 --> 00:44:54,692
What's wrong with you?

674
00:44:54,859 --> 00:44:56,152
The emperor wants us to be beggars

675
00:44:56,152 --> 00:44:57,737
Do you think we'd be beggars?

676
00:44:58,154 --> 00:44:59,864
I am smart, I am keen in kung-fu fighting

677
00:45:00,156 --> 00:45:01,616
Even the Gods won't let me be beggars

678
00:45:01,866 --> 00:45:02,658
That's true

679
00:45:02,658 --> 00:45:03,534
Am I like beggar?

680
00:45:03,576 --> 00:45:04,327
No

681
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:06,829
Buy something to eat, you beggars

682
00:45:10,166 --> 00:45:11,417
You treat us as beggars?

683
00:45:11,667 --> 00:45:13,127
Damn you!

684
00:45:13,169 --> 00:45:15,963
It's weird! Let's eat

685
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:21,469
Chan, since we have nothing to do

686
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:24,222
Let me take a seat, may be we can
have something to eat tonight

687
00:45:24,222 --> 00:45:25,723
You are treating yourself a beggar?

688
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:27,391
Dad, don't worry

689
00:45:27,642 --> 00:45:29,185
I need no begging for money

690
00:45:29,268 --> 00:45:30,436
How can you get money if you don't beg?

691
00:45:30,603 --> 00:45:31,479
Just ask someone to give us money

692
00:45:31,479 --> 00:45:33,397
Pal, may I know your name?

693
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:35,024
Nau Tai Chung

694
00:45:35,274 --> 00:45:36,525
Do you have money?

695
00:45:36,901 --> 00:45:38,152
- Yes
- Just give it to me

696
00:45:38,194 --> 00:45:38,903
OK

697
00:45:43,532 --> 00:45:44,283
Thank you

698
00:45:45,534 --> 00:45:46,410
Why should I give you money?

699
00:45:47,036 --> 00:45:48,120
Why do you ask so many questions?

700
00:45:48,287 --> 00:45:49,622
But I should know the reason

701
00:45:49,914 --> 00:45:52,083
Anyway, you should pay it

702
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:54,210
No, let's fix it up first

703
00:45:56,295 --> 00:45:57,630
Just give it to us, why are you asking so much?

704
00:45:57,630 --> 00:45:58,631
Hands off

705
00:45:58,673 --> 00:45:59,423
You mean robbing?

706
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:01,884
Robbery…

707
00:46:01,926 --> 00:46:04,428
I am not robbing, I am begging

708
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:07,974
Begging? How dare are you, you beggar,
you are cheating me!

709
00:46:07,974 --> 00:46:10,977
Don't you think I am stupid? I am smart, you know?

710
00:46:10,977 --> 00:46:12,103
Hey, two days passed,

711
00:46:12,144 --> 00:46:14,272
It's cold and I am hungry now

712
00:46:14,272 --> 00:46:15,940
Have you had any idea?

713
00:46:16,107 --> 00:46:18,901
I have a friend's girl-friend

714
00:46:18,901 --> 00:46:20,194
who is living in Peking

715
00:46:21,070 --> 00:46:23,322
She always admires you

716
00:46:23,489 --> 00:46:24,240
Really?

717
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:27,201
Yes, if you are willing to date her

718
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:29,745
I think she will help us to go back to Canton

719
00:46:30,788 --> 00:46:32,331
But, you have to sacrifice

720
00:46:32,331 --> 00:46:34,166
Do you mean…

721
00:46:34,417 --> 00:46:36,585
For our family, just as you said

722
00:46:37,044 --> 00:46:37,962
I know it's very hard for you

723
00:46:37,962 --> 00:46:39,255
Cut the crap, let's go and find her

724
00:46:39,297 --> 00:46:40,756
I have arranged it

725
00:46:41,173 --> 00:46:44,010
The one wearing red dress who stands
under the lantern, that's her

726
00:46:49,515 --> 00:46:51,475
Ghost!

727
00:46:56,105 --> 00:46:57,023
It's a benefit of you!

728
00:46:57,064 --> 00:46:59,608
Why don't you go yourself?

729
00:47:13,581 --> 00:47:15,541
Chan, I haven't tried this before

730
00:47:15,583 --> 00:47:16,542
Be careful!

731
00:47:16,542 --> 00:47:17,752
Don't worry

732
00:47:17,752 --> 00:47:18,544
I'll take care of you

733
00:47:18,711 --> 00:47:20,463
You want to earn money for shark-fins, right?

734
00:47:20,463 --> 00:47:21,339
Right…

735
00:47:23,424 --> 00:47:26,385
Get lost…

736
00:47:26,761 --> 00:47:27,803
No show here

737
00:47:31,349 --> 00:47:33,434
We just want to earn some money

738
00:47:33,434 --> 00:47:34,477
to go back to Canton

739
00:47:35,061 --> 00:47:37,521
Don't be that mean to us

740
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:40,775
It's the Royal instruction that,

741
00:47:41,025 --> 00:47:43,486
the So's family'd be beggars for life

742
00:47:44,278 --> 00:47:45,780
You two can only be beggars

743
00:47:46,155 --> 00:47:48,282
I am carrying my duty only Men!

744
00:47:48,491 --> 00:47:49,742
- Yes!
- Remove all the things

745
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:50,659
Yes

746
00:47:53,662 --> 00:47:54,872
Help!

747
00:47:55,164 --> 00:47:57,333
Master Chiu, it's hard for one to carry it

748
00:47:58,042 --> 00:48:00,086
Ask more men to remove it

749
00:48:00,086 --> 00:48:01,462
Yes

750
00:48:03,381 --> 00:48:04,131
What do you want?

751
00:48:04,173 --> 00:48:05,800
- No, we can't move it
- Let me do it

752
00:48:05,841 --> 00:48:07,176
You want a fight, don't you?

753
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:10,012
Last time you can escape from Yee Hung Hostel

754
00:48:10,471 --> 00:48:11,847
But you won't be that lucky this time

755
00:48:14,392 --> 00:48:15,643
He is powerful!

756
00:48:15,851 --> 00:48:18,354
I've to defeat him by one powerful strike

757
00:48:18,854 --> 00:48:20,439
I can't give him another chance to counter attack

758
00:48:42,503 --> 00:48:44,547
Chan…

759
00:48:45,339 --> 00:48:48,259
Chan…

760
00:48:48,634 --> 00:48:51,804
Your legs and hands are all broken by me

761
00:48:52,596 --> 00:48:54,640
You will be cripple for the rest of your life

762
00:48:56,559 --> 00:48:59,103
You want to fight? Not now!

763
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:02,940
But, you can beg for money

764
00:49:03,482 --> 00:49:04,650
Be a good beggar

765
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:10,531
Go, go away…

766
00:49:18,873 --> 00:49:22,668
Don't panic, Chan, it's OK

767
00:49:23,377 --> 00:49:28,048
Don't panic, you'll be alright… Chan!

768
00:49:28,257 --> 00:49:30,134
Don't panic

769
00:49:31,093 --> 00:49:34,638
I went to the examination hall

770
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:36,640
with my son,

771
00:49:37,057 --> 00:49:38,809
don't you know who was the examiner?

772
00:49:39,268 --> 00:49:41,729
He is Seng-ko-lin-ch'in, that bastard

773
00:49:42,271 --> 00:49:44,940
He was the enemy of us!

774
00:49:45,357 --> 00:49:46,817
About our story…

775
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:48,319
Let me stop here first, I want a smoke

776
00:49:49,612 --> 00:49:51,530
It's better to smoke now

777
00:49:51,572 --> 00:49:53,616
Yes, it's better

778
00:49:53,699 --> 00:49:57,077
We let him go in

779
00:49:57,286 --> 00:49:59,079
the Yee Hung Brothel

780
00:49:59,330 --> 00:50:01,040
But he framed us in return

781
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:03,209
He tricked my son

782
00:50:03,501 --> 00:50:05,669
during the examination

783
00:50:06,045 --> 00:50:09,173
But, my son was really smart and great

784
00:50:09,256 --> 00:50:11,509
To be the greatest Kung-fu fighter, invincible

785
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:13,844
Be the top

786
00:50:14,261 --> 00:50:15,596
Can you do that?

787
00:50:15,721 --> 00:50:16,430
Sure!

788
00:50:16,722 --> 00:50:17,389
Well

789
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:20,851
Come back to me if you can do that

790
00:50:22,603 --> 00:50:24,188
I think we should fix our wedding date first

791
00:50:24,563 --> 00:50:27,316
Because being the scholar is too simple to me

792
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:38,118
Write your name at once

793
00:50:40,996 --> 00:50:42,122
I don't know how to write

794
00:50:52,424 --> 00:50:55,302
Chan, what's wrong with you?

795
00:50:58,430 --> 00:50:59,640
Nightmare again?

796
00:51:01,183 --> 00:51:02,393
Don't think so much!

797
00:51:09,275 --> 00:51:12,403
Although you have taken 2 months' rest,

798
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:14,196
your legs and hands have not been
totally recovered

799
00:51:14,196 --> 00:51:17,116
- Mr. Ha Yee
- Coming

800
00:51:17,741 --> 00:51:20,244
I am going to beg for food

801
00:51:20,536 --> 00:51:22,830
I will make the last herbal tea for you later

802
00:51:23,581 --> 00:51:25,416
Dad, you go begging again?

803
00:51:26,166 --> 00:51:28,085
This job should leave to me

804
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:29,837
You are the Scholar…

805
00:51:32,256 --> 00:51:36,176
Chan, to be a beggar,

806
00:51:36,468 --> 00:51:38,095
there is some lessons!

807
00:51:38,887 --> 00:51:41,015
You can't just show your hand and beg for money

808
00:51:41,265 --> 00:51:43,934
At least you should have a bowl,
that represents your class

809
00:51:43,976 --> 00:51:46,437
Is it ridiculous?

810
00:51:47,062 --> 00:51:48,522
Hurry up

811
00:51:49,982 --> 00:51:52,067
I am coming

812
00:51:52,067 --> 00:51:54,028
We can't beg for good if we are late!

813
00:51:54,028 --> 00:51:54,987
Yes…

814
00:51:55,029 --> 00:51:56,905
You not a master now.

815
00:52:14,965 --> 00:52:15,674
Give me money please

816
00:52:15,716 --> 00:52:18,218
Go, go, I won't give you money

817
00:52:18,469 --> 00:52:20,929
Go, don't stop me from doing business

818
00:52:23,891 --> 00:52:25,517
Chan, dad is leaving

819
00:52:37,821 --> 00:52:41,575
Thank you…

820
00:52:47,498 --> 00:52:50,125
Thank you…

821
00:52:56,382 --> 00:52:57,883
Are you that mean?

822
00:52:57,925 --> 00:52:59,009
Why don't you write it yourself?

823
00:52:59,093 --> 00:53:01,887
You are off duty, so I just want to lend it

824
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:03,806
Don't you think I am idiot?

825
00:53:38,674 --> 00:53:39,633
Dad!

826
00:53:41,552 --> 00:53:42,428
What are you doing?

827
00:53:42,803 --> 00:53:46,473
I am cold… I am cold… Chan

828
00:53:48,058 --> 00:53:52,062
No, your body is as hot as fire

829
00:53:52,646 --> 00:53:53,480
Are you sick?

830
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:55,149
I am not…

831
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:57,651
It's late

832
00:53:58,527 --> 00:54:00,362
I have to search for food

833
00:54:02,156 --> 00:54:04,533
Lie down, I will go this time

834
00:54:05,159 --> 00:54:06,243
Are you go for begging?

835
00:54:06,827 --> 00:54:08,620
I have my own way to get food

836
00:54:08,871 --> 00:54:09,705
Take a rest now

837
00:54:10,164 --> 00:54:11,957
I will take you to the doctor after
getting some money

838
00:54:31,059 --> 00:54:33,020
You bastard, why don't you eat?

839
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:35,355
You should eat more so as to be strong!

840
00:54:38,150 --> 00:54:39,276
Finish it

841
00:54:39,401 --> 00:54:40,652
No, I am full

842
00:54:40,694 --> 00:54:43,238
You should take all the food

843
00:54:43,822 --> 00:54:46,450
OK, just forget it, let's go home

844
00:54:47,242 --> 00:54:50,871
Come on, eat them all

845
00:54:53,707 --> 00:54:54,541
Little kid!

846
00:54:54,625 --> 00:54:55,167
What?

847
00:54:55,167 --> 00:54:57,169
- May I… - No

848
00:55:15,395 --> 00:55:22,152
Be merciful!

849
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:29,701
Be merciful to me please

850
00:55:31,370 --> 00:55:33,831
My dad is dying!

851
00:55:35,541 --> 00:55:37,501
Beggar, do you want the broken carbon?

852
00:55:38,252 --> 00:55:38,961
Thank you

853
00:55:39,795 --> 00:55:41,630
Can you give me some coins?

854
00:55:43,674 --> 00:55:44,633
It's you!

855
00:55:44,758 --> 00:55:45,342
No, you have mistaken

856
00:55:46,051 --> 00:55:47,678
Sister, it's him

857
00:55:47,886 --> 00:55:48,887
No, no

858
00:55:48,929 --> 00:55:50,931
Sister, he is So Chan

859
00:55:54,309 --> 00:55:55,185
Wait!

860
00:55:59,815 --> 00:56:01,775
Miss, who are you looking for?

861
00:56:04,486 --> 00:56:05,737
I am sorry, I have mistaken

862
00:56:06,238 --> 00:56:07,865
Tracy, take some dumpling out

863
00:56:08,031 --> 00:56:10,576
You have mistake, he is not So Chan

864
00:56:11,743 --> 00:56:13,120
You are like my friend

865
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:16,540
Come to get some dumplings if you
get nothing to eat

866
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:19,167
We always have surplus

867
00:56:20,419 --> 00:56:21,295
Dumpling

868
00:56:21,336 --> 00:56:21,920
Take it

869
00:56:26,049 --> 00:56:27,593
Thank you…

870
00:56:30,387 --> 00:56:30,888
Sister,

871
00:56:31,346 --> 00:56:34,516
he wouldn't be that poor if not were you

872
00:56:47,529 --> 00:56:49,823
Dad, what are you doing?

873
00:56:49,823 --> 00:56:52,701
I can't stand the hunger

874
00:56:52,784 --> 00:56:56,413
So I bit the dumpling of the kid

875
00:56:56,705 --> 00:56:58,165
I have dumpling, take it back

876
00:56:58,165 --> 00:56:59,082
Could I pay you another head

877
00:56:59,124 --> 00:57:01,460
if I chopped yours

878
00:57:04,171 --> 00:57:05,380
Are you the Scholar?

879
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:09,593
Yes, are you the Scholar?

880
00:57:10,886 --> 00:57:11,637
I was nearly the Scholar

881
00:57:11,637 --> 00:57:13,388
He is the Scholar!

882
00:57:13,805 --> 00:57:15,515
We should give him face

883
00:57:16,475 --> 00:57:17,267
Thank you

884
00:57:17,267 --> 00:57:19,519
Hold it

885
00:57:21,396 --> 00:57:25,901
Are they going to treat me some food?

886
00:57:28,904 --> 00:57:29,988
The dog's rice

887
00:57:30,822 --> 00:57:34,451
Sir, I will let your dad go if you eat
the dog's rice now

888
00:57:39,122 --> 00:57:39,873
What's the matter?

889
00:57:40,832 --> 00:57:41,625
Come on

890
00:57:52,010 --> 00:57:53,637
Chan, don't eat that

891
00:57:53,845 --> 00:57:55,472
You can't face the others if you eat this

892
00:57:56,348 --> 00:57:58,100
Let's forget about me

893
00:57:58,392 --> 00:58:01,228
Sir, I was a general in Canton

894
00:58:02,104 --> 00:58:03,021
So what?

895
00:58:03,021 --> 00:58:04,773
Stop fighting

896
00:58:05,190 --> 00:58:05,941
Stand properly

897
00:58:13,323 --> 00:58:15,117
The Scholar eats the dog's food

898
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:17,953
Dad. It's quite delicious

899
00:58:20,539 --> 00:58:22,666
Try some. Come on

900
00:58:26,712 --> 00:58:29,047
It's delicious, isn't it?

901
00:58:33,885 --> 00:58:35,721
Dad, look!

902
00:58:36,054 --> 00:58:37,347
There is a slice of meat here

903
00:58:37,389 --> 00:58:40,058
It's pock chop!

904
00:58:49,276 --> 00:58:51,528
They are as hungry as dogs!

905
00:58:51,778 --> 00:58:53,572
Enjoy the dog food!

906
00:58:55,991 --> 00:58:58,201
Hurry, finish it

907
00:58:59,077 --> 00:59:00,203
That's too delicious!

908
00:59:00,746 --> 00:59:02,414
I want to save it for midnight snack

909
00:59:02,831 --> 00:59:04,124
It's very clever of you!

910
00:59:04,499 --> 00:59:06,168
You deserve to be beggars

911
00:59:08,545 --> 00:59:10,172
The Scholar is eating dog's food

912
00:59:10,172 --> 00:59:11,798
Come on, let's go and eat the man's food

913
00:59:16,011 --> 00:59:19,056
Uncle So!

914
00:59:23,769 --> 00:59:24,770
You are…

915
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:27,189
My dad was the Master of the
Beggar's Association

916
00:59:27,564 --> 00:59:29,733
Why don't you join our Beggar's Association

917
00:59:30,067 --> 00:59:31,359
Uncle Mok, isn't it a good idea?

918
00:59:31,818 --> 00:59:32,152
Good

919
00:59:32,152 --> 00:59:33,945
Isn't it the association for beggars?

920
00:59:34,154 --> 00:59:34,696
Yes!

921
00:59:34,696 --> 00:59:37,074
That's right, we are being beggars

922
00:59:37,365 --> 00:59:38,992
It's wise to join the Beggars' Association
so as to be taken care

923
00:59:38,992 --> 00:59:40,911
Chan… where is that fool going?

924
00:59:40,911 --> 00:59:42,120
Where is Chan?

925
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:44,164
OK, we will join you!

926
00:59:44,164 --> 00:59:46,458
Chan… Chan…

927
00:59:58,553 --> 01:00:00,180
Yushang, good year!

928
01:00:01,473 --> 01:00:03,350
Uncle Mok, happy new year!

929
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:04,893
This is for you

930
01:00:05,102 --> 01:00:06,686
Thank you

931
01:00:08,605 --> 01:00:11,149
One clothe is for you
and the other is for Chan

932
01:00:11,942 --> 01:00:13,652
Thank you. Put it down first

933
01:00:15,112 --> 01:00:15,904
Do you have any coins?

934
01:00:15,946 --> 01:00:16,738
Yes!

935
01:00:16,780 --> 01:00:18,573
- Give them to me, come on
- What for?

936
01:00:19,282 --> 01:00:22,828
It's new year, you should receive red pocket

937
01:00:22,953 --> 01:00:24,788
Come on, happy new year

938
01:00:24,830 --> 01:00:25,705
Good year!

939
01:00:25,705 --> 01:00:27,207
- Wish you ever beauty
- Thank you

940
01:00:27,207 --> 01:00:29,167
Uncle Mok, we needn't give red
pocket to each other

941
01:00:29,167 --> 01:00:30,252
How about Chan

942
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:34,881
Chan?

943
01:00:34,881 --> 01:00:36,007
He is still sleeping

944
01:00:36,216 --> 01:00:38,552
Don't wake him up

945
01:00:39,469 --> 01:00:40,971
I will cook you some new year cake

946
01:00:41,596 --> 01:00:44,099
Let me help you

947
01:00:45,642 --> 01:00:47,769
How can he sleep on the 1st day of this year?

948
01:00:49,271 --> 01:00:50,730
He is useless

949
01:00:53,316 --> 01:00:54,442
Are you all here?

950
01:00:55,902 --> 01:00:58,655
To fight against Chiu, we need a union of
the Beggar's Association

951
01:00:59,656 --> 01:01:02,367
So we must choose a new master to
in-charge the association

952
01:01:03,243 --> 01:01:05,287
Yushang…

953
01:01:06,371 --> 01:01:08,081
To defeat the Lotus position of the three seniors

954
01:01:08,456 --> 01:01:09,374
You should try your best

955
01:01:10,083 --> 01:01:13,086
Uncle, I don't have faith to defeat them

956
01:01:13,461 --> 01:01:15,338
Judging from my kung-fu now,

957
01:01:15,547 --> 01:01:18,300
how can I defeat them and become the new master?

958
01:01:19,676 --> 01:01:23,013
Take this Taiwan pill, after this,
your power will be improved

959
01:01:23,513 --> 01:01:26,683
No, this is the only medicine to cure
your inner injury

960
01:01:26,683 --> 01:01:27,726
How can I take this?

961
01:01:28,018 --> 01:01:29,311
Don't worry,

962
01:01:29,644 --> 01:01:31,605
you can ask my son to fight for you

963
01:01:31,605 --> 01:01:33,315
He was a scholar of Martial Arts

964
01:01:33,315 --> 01:01:33,982
before…

965
01:01:34,024 --> 01:01:35,108
Before…

966
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:36,943
Look at him, he is so lazy,

967
01:01:36,985 --> 01:01:39,112
he knows sleeping only

968
01:01:39,404 --> 01:01:41,323
He is not even qualified to be beggar!

969
01:01:41,364 --> 01:01:43,241
Don't be that frank, can you?

970
01:01:44,201 --> 01:01:46,203
Don't shout that loudly, OK?

971
01:01:54,419 --> 01:01:59,007
Chan, no matter how they despise you,

972
01:02:00,675 --> 01:02:02,552
I have faith on you

973
01:02:03,595 --> 01:02:05,597
Although you lost your power

974
01:02:06,306 --> 01:02:07,682
With your background,

975
01:02:08,058 --> 01:02:09,476
only you try hard,

976
01:02:09,768 --> 01:02:11,394
you can achieve something

977
01:02:11,770 --> 01:02:13,855
But I am now powerless,
I don't want to fight again

978
01:02:13,855 --> 01:02:15,106
You have power!

979
01:02:15,398 --> 01:02:16,274
Come on, beat me

980
01:02:20,445 --> 01:02:21,905
See, that was powerful

981
01:02:22,155 --> 01:02:23,782
Well, being a people…

982
01:02:23,949 --> 01:02:25,951
Forget it, don't waste time

983
01:02:25,951 --> 01:02:27,410
Why don't you let me sleep?

984
01:02:33,416 --> 01:02:34,501
Why did you lock the door?

985
01:02:34,542 --> 01:02:35,835
Enjoy sleeping

986
01:02:50,350 --> 01:02:54,271
Son, I tried very hard to get this for you

987
01:02:54,729 --> 01:02:57,941
Try hard to practise, be good

988
01:03:20,588 --> 01:03:21,881
Why do you go up?

989
01:03:22,757 --> 01:03:24,426
Even you want me to practise Kung-fu,

990
01:03:25,093 --> 01:03:26,886
you should give me a waddy first

991
01:03:28,388 --> 01:03:30,515
I am sorry, catch it

992
01:03:38,690 --> 01:03:41,318
Before being appointed important task,

993
01:03:41,526 --> 01:03:47,032
God will give you severe
training for soul and flesh.

994
01:03:53,955 --> 01:03:56,791
Did you write it?

995
01:03:57,375 --> 01:04:02,714
It's ugly, it's right to wipe it away

996
01:04:05,550 --> 01:04:06,509
Hey, beggar?

997
01:04:06,509 --> 01:04:07,010
Yes

998
01:04:07,510 --> 01:04:08,636
Me too

999
01:04:08,636 --> 01:04:09,429
Congratulation

1000
01:04:11,639 --> 01:04:13,099
- Are there anything to eat?
- No

1001
01:04:13,683 --> 01:04:15,060
Luckily, I have

1002
01:04:20,774 --> 01:04:24,944
See your look, it's a waste for you not to beg

1003
01:04:25,236 --> 01:04:26,446
None of your damn business

1004
01:04:27,655 --> 01:04:29,032
You are too lazy to be a beggar!

1005
01:04:29,282 --> 01:04:31,284
Your fellows despise you

1006
01:04:33,036 --> 01:04:34,913
I was always respected by others

1007
01:04:35,288 --> 01:04:36,664
But now, I am despised

1008
01:04:37,374 --> 01:04:38,792
Dislike from you,

1009
01:04:39,042 --> 01:04:41,169
no one respected me before

1010
01:04:41,795 --> 01:04:44,589
Listen to me. Don't go!

1011
01:04:45,215 --> 01:04:49,052
I remembered once in Canton

1012
01:04:49,344 --> 01:04:52,180
A fool paid my living, including hooking

1013
01:04:52,222 --> 01:04:53,848
What a weird man

1014
01:04:56,434 --> 01:04:58,061
Kid, I remembered you

1015
01:04:59,020 --> 01:05:01,356
Me too

1016
01:05:01,398 --> 01:05:02,315
Hey, hurry up

1017
01:05:02,357 --> 01:05:03,775
Repay my money, I am in urgent need

1018
01:05:03,817 --> 01:05:05,110
If I had money,

1019
01:05:05,318 --> 01:05:07,862
I wouldn't be beggar!

1020
01:05:11,491 --> 01:05:14,077
But, don't worry, you were my benefit or,

1021
01:05:14,285 --> 01:05:15,829
I will repay you one day

1022
01:05:16,955 --> 01:05:18,540
Thank you very much

1023
01:05:19,999 --> 01:05:21,334
But, you can't buy back what you lost

1024
01:05:21,751 --> 01:05:23,420
even you have money again

1025
01:05:24,754 --> 01:05:25,547
What did I lose?

1026
01:05:26,131 --> 01:05:28,216
Pride and faith

1027
01:05:28,716 --> 01:05:30,009
And your woman too

1028
01:05:32,554 --> 01:05:33,680
Who are you?

1029
01:05:34,097 --> 01:05:37,892
I am Hung Yat-sun, nicked name Old Bag Sun

1030
01:05:38,268 --> 01:05:41,354
I am the most senior one among the beggars

1031
01:05:41,604 --> 01:05:42,814
It's good to be beggar

1032
01:05:43,314 --> 01:05:44,941
You can do everything you want

1033
01:05:45,150 --> 01:05:46,151
You can do the same

1034
01:05:46,401 --> 01:05:49,279
Tell me, what do you want?
I will make your wish come true

1035
01:05:49,571 --> 01:05:50,697
I want to be human again

1036
01:05:50,738 --> 01:05:52,365
Don't you think you are not human like?

1037
01:05:53,575 --> 01:05:54,868
Not at all

1038
01:05:55,326 --> 01:05:57,704
So you have to be beggar now

1039
01:06:00,248 --> 01:06:02,625
Very good! Very good!

1040
01:06:03,376 --> 01:06:06,838
But I won't cheat you, from your head to toes

1041
01:06:06,838 --> 01:06:09,174
Every parts of you are beggar like

1042
01:06:10,467 --> 01:06:11,176
So what?

1043
01:06:11,217 --> 01:06:14,012
That means, you will be beggar for your life

1044
01:06:17,015 --> 01:06:18,975
I don't want to talk to you, I want a sleep first

1045
01:06:19,434 --> 01:06:21,603
Don't go, you can achieve in your profession

1046
01:06:21,811 --> 01:06:22,937
From my judgement,

1047
01:06:22,937 --> 01:06:24,564
you will be the king of beggars

1048
01:06:25,064 --> 01:06:27,692
King of beggars, what does that mean?

1049
01:06:29,319 --> 01:06:30,069
That is beggar

1050
01:06:34,532 --> 01:06:36,576
I won't care who you are,
I just want to stop the conversation

1051
01:06:36,576 --> 01:06:38,661
Please step aside, don't stop me from sleeping

1052
01:06:39,287 --> 01:06:40,121
Damn you!

1053
01:06:40,121 --> 01:06:41,664
No… I just want to sleep

1054
01:06:41,664 --> 01:06:42,999
with you

1055
01:06:43,625 --> 01:06:45,043
Idiot!

1056
01:06:48,755 --> 01:06:51,966
Kid, see you in the dream

1057
01:07:02,644 --> 01:07:05,438
Before the Buddha, the Disciples
returns to your position

1058
01:07:06,481 --> 01:07:09,984
To suppress the dragon and tight

1059
01:07:16,783 --> 01:07:19,285
So Chan, you enjoyed the prosperity of the world

1060
01:07:19,577 --> 01:07:21,162
And you tasted the bitter fruit of the world too

1061
01:07:21,579 --> 01:07:22,956
Now you regretted

1062
01:07:23,248 --> 01:07:26,084
On behalf of Master Hung

1063
01:07:26,209 --> 01:07:27,627
I appoint you to be the "Sleeping Disciple"

1064
01:07:28,086 --> 01:07:31,339
Now, I will teach you the
"Sleeping Disciple's Fist"!

1065
01:07:31,589 --> 01:07:34,509
Hope you can make good use of it Come on

1066
01:07:39,222 --> 01:07:43,393
Senior…

1067
01:07:48,731 --> 01:07:51,401
The bitter pasted

1068
01:07:56,030 --> 01:08:00,368
Long life to you…

1069
01:08:02,495 --> 01:08:05,415
Here comes the white Goat

1070
01:08:05,832 --> 01:08:10,211
My mother, give me power

1071
01:08:10,545 --> 01:08:11,921
To save the people!

1072
01:08:33,026 --> 01:08:34,902
Tomorrow the Emperor will go hunting

1073
01:08:35,862 --> 01:08:38,239
I will send him a pretty girl,
so as to get close to him

1074
01:08:39,782 --> 01:08:43,202
Yuen Ling, you should seduce him tomorrow

1075
01:08:43,703 --> 01:08:44,579
Yes

1076
01:08:45,997 --> 01:08:47,457
If we can kill the Emperor,

1077
01:08:48,249 --> 01:08:49,626
I can take over his reign

1078
01:08:50,251 --> 01:08:52,837
I will give you a share of wealth!

1079
01:08:57,592 --> 01:09:01,262
Long life to you

1080
01:09:01,763 --> 01:09:02,305
Senior!

1081
01:09:02,597 --> 01:09:03,473
Let's go back now

1082
01:09:35,546 --> 01:09:36,297
Senior!

1083
01:09:36,297 --> 01:09:37,298
Let's go!

1084
01:09:50,353 --> 01:09:51,229
Senior!

1085
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:31,769
- Let's chase them
- Stop!

1086
01:10:33,271 --> 01:10:34,397
The Emperor is setting off soon

1087
01:10:35,648 --> 01:10:36,691
You killed woman…

1088
01:10:37,024 --> 01:10:38,484
You should replace her to be
a gift to the Emperor!

1089
01:10:44,866 --> 01:10:47,577
No one dares come up to fight for the leadership?

1090
01:10:47,702 --> 01:10:50,079
Ask Mok to give us the "Dog Hitting Waddy"!

1091
01:10:57,295 --> 01:10:59,422
Where have they been?

1092
01:11:00,047 --> 01:11:01,215
I don't know,

1093
01:11:01,716 --> 01:11:04,260
I saw them chat,

1094
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:05,178
then they went away

1095
01:11:07,555 --> 01:11:08,973
Are there any affair between them?

1096
01:11:20,735 --> 01:11:22,278
Now, we are going to choose the new leader

1097
01:11:28,659 --> 01:11:29,702
Uncle Mok…

1098
01:11:29,702 --> 01:11:30,787
I am scared,

1099
01:11:30,787 --> 01:11:31,621
I think you won't come back

1100
01:11:31,621 --> 01:11:33,289
- How is it?
- Where is sister?

1101
01:11:33,790 --> 01:11:35,666
Your sister is caught by Chiu

1102
01:11:36,042 --> 01:11:38,377
We'd find someone to compete for the leadership

1103
01:11:44,091 --> 01:11:46,177
Who should go?

1104
01:12:00,274 --> 01:12:00,942
I'll do it

1105
01:12:00,942 --> 01:12:01,734
Uncle Mok

1106
01:12:01,901 --> 01:12:03,194
Why don't you let me try?

1107
01:12:40,898 --> 01:12:41,691
Chan,

1108
01:12:43,818 --> 01:12:46,070
you are not qualified, come down

1109
01:12:47,321 --> 01:12:50,366
Since you don't have a good candidate,
I'll give you some advantage

1110
01:12:50,783 --> 01:12:52,785
Chan, it's not a game

1111
01:12:53,119 --> 01:12:54,912
You will be killed, come down

1112
01:12:55,162 --> 01:12:57,999
It doesn't matter, I have forgotten
my life already

1113
01:12:58,207 --> 01:12:59,709
Bullshit, throw him to death

1114
01:13:09,176 --> 01:13:11,262
Well, I will make your wish come true

1115
01:13:39,624 --> 01:13:40,166
What is he doing?

1116
01:13:40,166 --> 01:13:40,917
Sleeping

1117
01:13:56,015 --> 01:13:57,433
Isn't this stance…

1118
01:13:58,434 --> 01:14:00,603
Uncle Sun's "Sleeping Disciple's Fists'?

1119
01:14:01,479 --> 01:14:02,396
Set the position!

1120
01:14:18,329 --> 01:14:19,497
Is it dawn?

1121
01:15:18,514 --> 01:15:19,724
I am sorry!

1122
01:15:19,974 --> 01:15:20,766
I won

1123
01:15:21,058 --> 01:15:22,143
What is the use for defeating us?

1124
01:15:22,309 --> 01:15:23,602
You don't know how to use the
"Dog Hitting Waddy".

1125
01:15:24,395 --> 01:15:25,604
You are not qualified to be the leader of us

1126
01:15:28,733 --> 01:15:30,067
"Dog Hitting Waddy"?

1127
01:15:34,739 --> 01:15:36,115
It's for hitting dogs

1128
01:15:37,533 --> 01:15:39,660
I do know how to use this waddy!

1129
01:15:39,702 --> 01:15:40,995
But it's dislike from the standard stances!

1130
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:41,996
It's quite powerful!

1131
01:15:46,625 --> 01:15:48,502
He broke the waddy!

1132
01:15:50,129 --> 01:15:52,965
He broke the treasure of our Association,
let's kill him!

1133
01:16:06,562 --> 01:16:09,065
I am Master Hung, who dares go against me?

1134
01:16:09,982 --> 01:16:11,859
I set the rules of the association

1135
01:16:12,318 --> 01:16:14,695
Any student who defeated the Lotus Position

1136
01:16:15,029 --> 01:16:16,822
could be the leader

1137
01:16:17,114 --> 01:16:18,824
Have you all forgotten?

1138
01:16:19,325 --> 01:16:21,744
We becomes the biggest association

1139
01:16:21,952 --> 01:16:23,579
because of being united

1140
01:16:24,121 --> 01:16:26,373
I left you the "Dog Hitting Waddy",

1141
01:16:26,373 --> 01:16:28,876
is just for memory

1142
01:16:29,043 --> 01:16:31,337
The waddy is meaningless

1143
01:16:31,754 --> 01:16:33,881
But you fools take this as treasure

1144
01:16:33,881 --> 01:16:36,801
And fight among yourselves for this damn waddy!

1145
01:16:36,884 --> 01:16:39,720
In these five years, you have had no
leader, don't you feel shy?

1146
01:16:40,179 --> 01:16:41,680
So Chan broke the waddy,

1147
01:16:41,680 --> 01:16:42,723
so you won't fight for this anymore

1148
01:16:42,723 --> 01:16:44,433
He is correct to do so

1149
01:16:44,475 --> 01:16:45,893
This youngster is so junior,

1150
01:16:45,893 --> 01:16:47,394
but he is a genius, a smart ass

1151
01:16:47,394 --> 01:16:49,772
He is being taught by my disciple Hung Yat Sun

1152
01:16:49,814 --> 01:16:51,649
Who doesn't respect him is going against me too

1153
01:16:53,150 --> 01:16:54,527
You should respect him,

1154
01:16:54,527 --> 01:16:55,820
your new leader, and you'd love him,

1155
01:16:55,861 --> 01:16:59,365
whole-heartedly, to care much for him,
maybe, treat him dinner

1156
01:16:59,365 --> 01:17:00,825
Then, although I am in heaven,

1157
01:17:00,991 --> 01:17:05,121
I will bless all of you, all the best

1158
01:17:07,206 --> 01:17:08,082
Isn't it true?

1159
01:17:09,208 --> 01:17:11,085
You'd better trust it

1160
01:17:11,919 --> 01:17:13,295
Master Hung's soul talked to us,

1161
01:17:13,504 --> 01:17:15,965
we are blessed

1162
01:17:16,757 --> 01:17:19,176
They are easily to be cheated,
I am really a genius!

1163
01:17:19,552 --> 01:17:21,178
We'll have better living

1164
01:17:23,722 --> 01:17:24,890
What happened?

1165
01:17:27,351 --> 01:17:28,769
Let's greet the new Master

1166
01:17:34,567 --> 01:17:35,860
Bravo…

1167
01:17:38,154 --> 01:17:40,781
Uncle Mok, my son is really great!

1168
01:17:42,908 --> 01:17:44,952
I can't guess you have learnt the
"Sleeping Disciple's Fists"?!

1169
01:17:46,745 --> 01:17:49,540
From now on, you are the new leader of us

1170
01:17:50,624 --> 01:17:52,001
This is the book of "Dragon Suppressing Stances"

1171
01:17:52,710 --> 01:17:54,420
And, I will give you the Taiwan Pill

1172
01:17:55,254 --> 01:17:57,256
Hope you will be a good leader

1173
01:17:58,716 --> 01:18:00,509
I just want to save Yushang as soon as possible

1174
01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:04,555
Yushang didn't make a wrong choice

1175
01:18:04,930 --> 01:18:09,018
Bravo! Bravo!

1176
01:18:14,023 --> 01:18:16,192
Uncle Mok, how are you?

1177
01:18:16,317 --> 01:18:19,987
Uncle Mok!

1178
01:18:22,072 --> 01:18:25,618
Uncle Mok…

1179
01:18:47,348 --> 01:18:50,809


1180
01:18:51,477 --> 01:18:54,939


1181
01:18:55,564 --> 01:18:59,193


1182
01:18:59,735 --> 01:19:03,239


1183
01:19:03,948 --> 01:19:07,451


1184
01:19:08,077 --> 01:19:11,580


1185
01:19:12,248 --> 01:19:14,792


1186
01:19:14,875 --> 01:19:15,501
Chan,

1187
01:19:15,793 --> 01:19:18,087
do you understand everything written in this book?

1188
01:19:18,295 --> 01:19:19,838
Don't think that I am so foolish

1189
01:19:20,464 --> 01:19:21,715
After getting the help of Taiwan Pill

1190
01:19:22,007 --> 01:19:24,593
My initial power is increased

1191
01:19:25,511 --> 01:19:28,097
I can control the 17th stances

1192
01:19:28,806 --> 01:19:31,100
But the last stance,

1193
01:19:31,350 --> 01:19:32,559
there is no picture or description of it

1194
01:19:33,018 --> 01:19:34,144
I can't understand at all

1195
01:19:34,645 --> 01:19:37,606
But Uncle Mok is dead, what'll we do now?

1196
01:19:38,190 --> 01:19:39,024
Just go ahead

1197
01:19:39,233 --> 01:19:41,277
No matter how, I have to save Yushang first

1198
01:19:41,527 --> 01:19:45,030


1199
01:19:45,656 --> 01:19:49,201


1200
01:19:49,827 --> 01:19:53,414


1201
01:19:53,998 --> 01:19:57,584


1202
01:20:53,223 --> 01:20:55,309
Check whether the camp is ready or not?

1203
01:20:55,309 --> 01:20:56,101
Yes!

1204
01:21:16,205 --> 01:21:17,122
Chiu,

1205
01:21:17,831 --> 01:21:20,000
why do you bring this woman here?

1206
01:21:20,292 --> 01:21:21,835
I know the Emperor loves pretty woman

1207
01:21:22,419 --> 01:21:24,171
So I want to send him this gift

1208
01:21:24,755 --> 01:21:25,798
And I want to meet him too

1209
01:21:26,131 --> 01:21:28,634
There is no order from the Emperor

1210
01:21:29,218 --> 01:21:31,428
Men, come and take this woman to the camp

1211
01:21:31,428 --> 01:21:32,137
Yes

1212
01:21:32,805 --> 01:21:33,597
Go!

1213
01:21:36,892 --> 01:21:39,937
Sir, you look great!

1214
01:21:41,105 --> 01:21:43,065
I think you should go back

1215
01:21:43,315 --> 01:21:44,775
to your own position

1216
01:21:45,609 --> 01:21:46,360
Yes

1217
01:22:02,376 --> 01:22:03,085
Your Majesty,

1218
01:22:03,293 --> 01:22:05,295
Officer Chiu brings this woman to you

1219
01:22:06,046 --> 01:22:06,964
Woman?

1220
01:22:09,216 --> 01:22:10,217
Chiu knows my hobby!

1221
01:22:11,468 --> 01:22:13,470
I want to take a bath first, bring her to me later

1222
01:22:13,720 --> 01:22:14,513
Yes

1223
01:22:37,411 --> 01:22:40,914
This bastard wants to see the Emperor,

1224
01:22:41,915 --> 01:22:44,877
if I let him see His Majesty oftenly,
my post will be taken away

1225
01:22:50,090 --> 01:22:50,966
Men

1226
01:22:52,759 --> 01:22:53,260
Sir

1227
01:22:53,844 --> 01:22:55,345
- Check what had happened
- Yes

1228
01:22:58,891 --> 01:23:01,935
Sir, there are many people coming from the forest

1229
01:23:02,728 --> 01:23:03,729
Who are they?

1230
01:23:03,812 --> 01:23:05,105
I don't know!

1231
01:23:06,190 --> 01:23:07,065
Release the alarm smoke

1232
01:23:07,316 --> 01:23:07,941
Be alert

1233
01:23:07,941 --> 01:23:08,817
Yes

1234
01:23:18,202 --> 01:23:19,870
There is smoke ahead, let's get armed

1235
01:23:19,870 --> 01:23:20,537
Yes

1236
01:24:22,599 --> 01:24:23,892
Damn you beggars

1237
01:24:28,647 --> 01:24:30,774
So Chan, what are you doing?

1238
01:24:31,692 --> 01:24:34,820
Nothing, I just want to beg for money

1239
01:24:35,237 --> 01:24:37,447
Shit, do you want to be killed

1240
01:24:37,781 --> 01:24:39,324
It's you who will be killed

1241
01:24:40,659 --> 01:24:42,077
Chiu wants to raise a rebel,

1242
01:24:42,077 --> 01:24:43,453
he is going to assassinate the king

1243
01:24:43,662 --> 01:24:45,163
You fat-headed

1244
01:24:46,206 --> 01:24:47,457
Who do you think you are?

1245
01:24:47,708 --> 01:24:50,210
How dare you frame the courtier?

1246
01:24:50,669 --> 01:24:53,380
I will kill you if you step forward

1247
01:24:57,217 --> 01:25:00,137
Chan, how can we fight with them?

1248
01:25:00,178 --> 01:25:01,179
- Senior
- Yes

1249
01:25:01,847 --> 01:25:02,764
Where are the rest of our men?

1250
01:25:02,806 --> 01:25:04,349
They are coming

1251
01:25:05,892 --> 01:25:06,893
We have no time,

1252
01:25:07,352 --> 01:25:08,687
you stay here to wait for the others

1253
01:25:08,854 --> 01:25:09,313
I will go first

1254
01:25:09,313 --> 01:25:10,147
I will follow

1255
01:25:10,188 --> 01:25:10,897
Be serious

1256
01:25:11,064 --> 01:25:12,524
Master, don't worry

1257
01:25:13,400 --> 01:25:14,943
Am I going to die?

1258
01:25:15,152 --> 01:25:16,653
Say something lucky, OK?

1259
01:25:16,945 --> 01:25:21,491
Sure! Happy birthday to you…

1260
01:25:21,950 --> 01:25:24,870
Happy birthday to you…

1261
01:25:25,078 --> 01:25:26,496
Happy birthday to you…

1262
01:25:26,496 --> 01:25:27,497
That's enough

1263
01:25:27,539 --> 01:25:28,290
I haven't finished

1264
01:25:28,665 --> 01:25:30,000
- Go on after I left
- Sure

1265
01:25:42,638 --> 01:25:45,098
There is smoke ahead,
someone must have alarmed them

1266
01:25:47,601 --> 01:25:48,894
- Get ready the Unicorn Smoke
- Yes

1267
01:25:48,894 --> 01:25:49,936
Attack the main camp

1268
01:26:51,248 --> 01:26:54,584
Rebel! Help!

1269
01:26:55,210 --> 01:26:56,211
They should be killed

1270
01:26:56,253 --> 01:26:58,255
The one who didn't kill you should be killed

1271
01:26:59,339 --> 01:27:01,675
Shit, the poisoned smoke

1272
01:27:01,925 --> 01:27:03,343
is blowing to the Royal camp

1273
01:27:09,099 --> 01:27:10,851
No, the wind direction changed

1274
01:27:11,393 --> 01:27:13,061
Yes, wait for me

1275
01:27:14,980 --> 01:27:17,774
If the beggars don't retreat now,
we will kill with no mercy

1276
01:27:36,460 --> 01:27:37,377
Have a look

1277
01:27:41,923 --> 01:27:43,383
The Unicorn Smoke of the Tin Li Sect

1278
01:27:54,144 --> 01:27:56,396
Be calm, urine is the antidote to the poison

1279
01:27:57,647 --> 01:27:59,733
Come and piss

1280
01:28:03,445 --> 01:28:05,447
How about me?

1281
01:28:05,572 --> 01:28:07,866
Don't worry, I can give you some urine

1282
01:28:07,949 --> 01:28:09,117
Come on, hold it

1283
01:28:14,581 --> 01:28:15,916
Rush in!

1284
01:28:25,175 --> 01:28:25,884
How is the situation?

1285
01:28:26,593 --> 01:28:28,386
Thanks for Your Majesty's luck,
the wind direction changed

1286
01:28:28,470 --> 01:28:29,805
The smoke is going to the other direction

1287
01:28:29,888 --> 01:28:31,306
How about our armies?

1288
01:28:31,640 --> 01:28:33,308
They are all dead

1289
01:28:34,518 --> 01:28:35,143
Take me the sword

1290
01:28:35,227 --> 01:28:36,353
Don't… don't!

1291
01:28:36,353 --> 01:28:37,687
Get lost! Get lost!

1292
01:28:37,813 --> 01:28:39,731
Your Majesty, it's dangerous, don't go!

1293
01:28:39,773 --> 01:28:42,692
Get lost, don't you want
to wait for death, get lost

1294
01:28:44,277 --> 01:28:45,529
You are ordered to get away

1295
01:28:46,279 --> 01:28:47,405
You can't go!

1296
01:29:26,778 --> 01:29:27,404
Protect me

1297
01:29:53,096 --> 01:29:53,972
Chan?

1298
01:29:56,141 --> 01:29:56,808
Yushang

1299
01:29:57,434 --> 01:29:58,435
How did you get here?

1300
01:29:58,852 --> 01:30:00,812
It's a long story

1301
01:30:01,146 --> 01:30:02,856
We left our base last night

1302
01:30:03,106 --> 01:30:04,190
We reached the Great Wall

1303
01:30:04,441 --> 01:30:06,443
this morning

1304
01:30:06,735 --> 01:30:08,695
We stayed one hour for lunch

1305
01:30:08,904 --> 01:30:09,863
I pissed once

1306
01:30:10,155 --> 01:30:10,822
- Really?
- Yes

1307
01:30:11,072 --> 01:30:12,240
Then I want to eat a sweet potato

1308
01:30:12,240 --> 01:30:13,366
But only dumpling left

1309
01:30:13,575 --> 01:30:16,119
You know, I don't like eating dumpling

1310
01:30:16,786 --> 01:30:18,914
I am late to save you, please forgive me

1311
01:30:21,291 --> 01:30:22,459
To protect the Emperor

1312
01:30:22,459 --> 01:30:23,293
Yes

1313
01:30:26,796 --> 01:30:27,631
You betrayer!

1314
01:30:27,631 --> 01:30:28,506
Catch him

1315
01:30:34,846 --> 01:30:35,680
Your Majesty

1316
01:30:38,767 --> 01:30:40,977
You bastard, give your kingdom to me

1317
01:30:40,977 --> 01:30:42,270
What are you telling him?

1318
01:30:45,273 --> 01:30:46,024
It's you

1319
01:30:46,024 --> 01:30:48,151
Yes, I am Beggar So

1320
01:30:48,485 --> 01:30:51,488
Why don't you sleep in your hut?

1321
01:30:51,780 --> 01:30:54,366
Well, I am a little bit sleepy

1322
01:31:31,319 --> 01:31:32,237
"Sleeping Disciple"?

1323
01:31:32,404 --> 01:31:36,574
Yes. Look at you, you are like beggar too

1324
01:31:36,866 --> 01:31:38,368
Are you interested to join us?

1325
01:31:40,078 --> 01:31:42,372
I can't guess you could recover!

1326
01:31:42,622 --> 01:31:44,958
Yes, it's all because of you

1327
01:31:48,920 --> 01:31:50,922
Did you generate all your force? I didn't

1328
01:32:09,482 --> 01:32:12,736
Fool, only the "Dragon Suppressing
Stances" scare me

1329
01:32:13,028 --> 01:32:14,904
I won't give a damn to any other stances

1330
01:32:26,750 --> 01:32:29,252
"Dragon Suppress Stances"

1331
01:32:31,504 --> 01:32:32,922
"Dragon in the sky"

1332
01:32:34,132 --> 01:32:35,050
"Dragon swings its tail"

1333
01:32:35,050 --> 01:32:35,800
"Dragon steals the heart"

1334
01:32:35,884 --> 01:32:37,093
Dragon swims, dragon in the field,

1335
01:32:37,093 --> 01:32:38,219
dragon dances…

1336
01:32:38,219 --> 01:32:39,220
Dragon's descendant,

1337
01:32:39,220 --> 01:32:40,305
dragon's wish…

1338
01:32:40,305 --> 01:32:41,639
Dragon's spirit, dragon's couple

1339
01:32:41,639 --> 01:32:43,516
Finished

1340
01:33:17,592 --> 01:33:19,928
You can't finish the last stance,

1341
01:33:20,178 --> 01:33:21,387
you can defeat me

1342
01:33:21,387 --> 01:33:22,347
after learning the 18th stance

1343
01:33:22,430 --> 01:33:24,099
But you have no chance

1344
01:33:32,023 --> 01:33:32,941
Chan!

1345
01:33:47,122 --> 01:33:49,666
I've got it. Just mix the 17 stances,

1346
01:33:49,666 --> 01:33:50,750
it's the 18th stance then

1347
01:33:51,209 --> 01:33:53,378
I am too smart!

1348
01:34:22,949 --> 01:34:25,910
The 18 stance, "It's a regret to kill the Dragon"!

1349
01:34:55,523 --> 01:34:57,400
Chan, are you alright?

1350
01:34:57,734 --> 01:34:59,485
See, don't you think I am alright?

1351
01:35:00,111 --> 01:35:01,446
Your post is really smart

1352
01:35:01,696 --> 01:35:03,198
But your look is awful!

1353
01:35:03,198 --> 01:35:04,532
Idiot, I am fine

1354
01:35:04,574 --> 01:35:05,700
I can marry tonight

1355
01:35:05,700 --> 01:35:06,826
You are great!

1356
01:35:16,878 --> 01:35:20,089
Chan! Are you okay?

1357
01:35:20,173 --> 01:35:20,882
Where is Chiu?

1358
01:35:22,091 --> 01:35:23,134
He is around

1359
01:35:23,134 --> 01:35:24,344
Around?

1360
01:35:25,011 --> 01:35:26,512
He became ash

1361
01:35:27,263 --> 01:35:29,390
Damn it!

1362
01:35:29,807 --> 01:35:30,475
Master

1363
01:35:30,725 --> 01:35:32,393
Chiu's fellows are all caught by us

1364
01:35:36,481 --> 01:35:37,774
Thank you, buddies

1365
01:35:41,653 --> 01:35:42,278
Yushang

1366
01:35:42,570 --> 01:35:44,614
We have an agreement, do you remember?

1367
01:35:45,573 --> 01:35:49,244
Yes, be the top of all

1368
01:35:49,285 --> 01:35:51,329
Invincible

1369
01:35:51,537 --> 01:35:53,164
But, I can't be the Scholar

1370
01:35:53,498 --> 01:35:56,251
But I don't like Scholar at all

1371
01:35:56,584 --> 01:35:58,253
I love beggar

1372
01:36:00,004 --> 01:36:01,422
You first, I will go after you

1373
01:36:14,686 --> 01:36:18,106
Seng-ko-lin-ch'in,
you are really a fool

1374
01:36:18,815 --> 01:36:19,941
You bring a thief to harm me

1375
01:36:20,316 --> 01:36:22,277
Now, you are titled to be a beggar

1376
01:36:22,610 --> 01:36:25,113
You have potential to be beggar

1377
01:36:25,697 --> 01:36:26,781
Report duty in the temple tomorrow

1378
01:36:27,573 --> 01:36:28,866
If there anyone bullies you,
just tell them my name

1379
01:36:30,576 --> 01:36:32,829
Thank you, thank you master

1380
01:36:33,037 --> 01:36:36,124
So Chan, what do you want as reward?

1381
01:36:38,710 --> 01:36:40,044
Don't you have anything to tell me?

1382
01:36:44,215 --> 01:36:46,175
Nothing special, let's go

1383
01:36:47,093 --> 01:36:47,844
Pick me up

1384
01:36:49,137 --> 01:36:50,722
Mister
So!

1385
01:36:50,805 --> 01:36:51,681
Put me down

1386
01:36:52,390 --> 01:36:53,391
Although you have saved me,

1387
01:36:53,808 --> 01:36:56,144
if you don't respect me, I will kill you

1388
01:36:56,894 --> 01:36:59,647
If so, you needn't squat and talk to me

1389
01:36:59,939 --> 01:37:02,650
Don't move, it'll attract their attention

1390
01:37:05,528 --> 01:37:07,322
Actually we have no relation,

1391
01:37:07,322 --> 01:37:08,990
we have nothing to chat

1392
01:37:09,407 --> 01:37:10,783
You have billions of fellows

1393
01:37:10,992 --> 01:37:13,453
Your force makes me worry

1394
01:37:14,329 --> 01:37:16,372
The number of fellow doesn't depend on me,

1395
01:37:16,372 --> 01:37:17,540
but you

1396
01:37:17,832 --> 01:37:18,750
What?

1397
01:37:19,751 --> 01:37:22,670
If you are great, making the
society peace and wealthy,

1398
01:37:23,129 --> 01:37:24,922
no one wishes to be beggar, right?

1399
01:37:27,300 --> 01:37:29,552
- It's reasonable
- Be smart

1400
01:37:30,261 --> 01:37:31,012
But,

1401
01:37:31,679 --> 01:37:34,057
give me some face

1402
01:37:34,849 --> 01:37:35,683
Yes

1403
01:37:35,975 --> 01:37:37,393
Long life…

1404
01:37:37,393 --> 01:37:39,187
- …to Your Majesty
- Get up

1405
01:37:45,735 --> 01:37:47,403
Pal, do you know me?

1406
01:37:47,737 --> 01:37:49,447
Of course! You beggar

1407
01:37:49,489 --> 01:37:51,199
You beg with your girl, you think I'll
give you money out of mercy?

1408
01:37:51,199 --> 01:37:52,825
Yes, please give me money

1409
01:37:52,867 --> 01:37:54,994
No mercy, go away

1410
01:37:55,078 --> 01:37:55,912
No, you should pay me

1411
01:37:56,287 --> 01:37:57,372
It's a must, pal

1412
01:37:58,623 --> 01:38:01,167
A must? Kidding?

1413
01:38:01,417 --> 01:38:03,836
It's true, be quick

1414
01:38:03,836 --> 01:38:04,670
It's bad luck to meet you

1415
01:38:05,004 --> 01:38:06,089
Stop

1416
01:38:06,089 --> 01:38:07,131
What?

1417
01:38:07,215 --> 01:38:10,343
See my family? Give more

1418
01:38:10,468 --> 01:38:11,552
How much?

1419
01:38:11,594 --> 01:38:13,554
Not less than a thousand, got me?

1420
01:38:17,767 --> 01:38:19,102
Say thank you now

1421
01:38:20,436 --> 01:38:21,354
Thank you, uncle

1422
01:38:21,437 --> 01:38:23,272
Hurry up

1423
01:38:25,900 --> 01:38:28,486
Follow me… go…
