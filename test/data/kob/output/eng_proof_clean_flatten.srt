1
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:17,971
Young master, we are ready

2
00:02:59,763 --> 00:03:00,472
What's a hard job for you, young master

3
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:01,473
The towel, young master

4
00:03:10,816 --> 00:03:12,318
What did he write?

5
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:13,402
His name!

6
00:03:13,777 --> 00:03:17,489
Great! Young master knows how to write his name!

7
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:18,615
Yes!

8
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:19,908
Damn!

9
00:03:25,289 --> 00:03:26,123
Nice calligraphy

10
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:28,459
Get lost

11
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:34,965
Nice calligraphy! So Cha Ha Yee Chan!

12
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:36,884
It's reversed, Master

13
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:38,927
Chan Yee Ha Cha So

14
00:03:39,803 --> 00:03:42,639
Good boy, but, don't be proud! Got me?

15
00:03:44,892 --> 00:03:47,478
Dad, since the first emperor of the Ching Dynasty,

16
00:03:47,603 --> 00:03:49,313
our family

17
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:51,189
has been illiterate

18
00:03:51,273 --> 00:03:54,401
But not, my son, that's your grandson,

19
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:56,403
he knows how to write his name!

20
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:59,572
Dad, it's very great!

21
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:01,533
He knows writing now,

22
00:04:01,617 --> 00:04:03,494
he will be a scholar one day

23
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:04,828
Now, he knows how to write his name,

24
00:04:04,912 --> 00:04:06,872
he will have a son later

25
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:09,749
Young master, you should try hard to learn

26
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:12,085
Chan, I think, we should mount it

27
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:12,836
OK

28
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,005
Professor, show it in some obvious places

29
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,131
By the way, one minute,

30
00:04:16,215 --> 00:04:18,968
why don't you carry it with traditional decoration in the street?

31
00:04:19,051 --> 00:04:19,635
What?

32
00:04:19,718 --> 00:04:20,552
Let's go!

33
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:22,971
Chan, come and sit…

34
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:26,100
I am so pleased that you are that hard-working and filial

35
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:30,145
Listen to me, I am notorious for being a spendthrift

36
00:04:30,229 --> 00:04:32,732
My fortune is almost used up

37
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:35,525
If I die one day,

38
00:04:35,943 --> 00:04:37,445
you should depend on yourself

39
00:04:37,528 --> 00:04:38,571
I used to depend on myself

40
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:41,865
The cheque is worth 100,000 taels! Don't be an extravagant spender

41
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:44,576
Give me the imported hat

42
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:45,744
Where are you going? Chan!

43
00:04:46,537 --> 00:04:47,329
I am having a grand birthday party tonight

44
00:04:48,664 --> 00:04:49,456
How old are you?

45
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:51,625
25 years old. Come earlier

46
00:04:52,251 --> 00:04:54,795
But you should dress up first

47
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:56,546
You are like a beggar!

48
00:04:57,047 --> 00:04:59,132
How can a beggar be that rich?! I do want to be a rich beggar!

49
00:05:02,386 --> 00:05:03,637
That fat-headed…

50
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,721
Come over here

51
00:05:05,097 --> 00:05:06,098
What's the matter?

52
00:05:06,598 --> 00:05:09,476
The invitation card of my son is great!

53
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,104
If I hold a birthday party in the future, I want a better invitation card!

54
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:34,668
Your Majesty, how do you think about the Cantonese Opera?

55
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:39,089
For sure, it can't compete with Peking Opera!

56
00:05:39,631 --> 00:05:41,883
But, I appreciate to view this

57
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:46,763
Money…

58
00:05:47,598 --> 00:05:50,392
Tips. Tips…

59
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:51,726
Happy birthday to you, Mr So

60
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:53,979
I am homeless and sick…

61
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:57,607
I am poor, I am damn poor!

62
00:05:57,983 --> 00:05:58,859
Please give me some money

63
00:05:58,942 --> 00:05:59,860
Kidding? Damn you beggar!

64
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:02,487
How can you beg here?

65
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:03,739
Go to hell!

66
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:04,614
Give him tips

67
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:05,824
Yes, young master

68
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:08,034
Are you kidding? How can you give him tips?

69
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:10,579
A beggar is a man too

70
00:06:10,662 --> 00:06:12,122
Everyone can come here if he has money

71
00:06:12,206 --> 00:06:13,124
Your living,

72
00:06:13,207 --> 00:06:15,501
including the expenditure for hooking, I will pay for you!

73
00:06:15,584 --> 00:06:16,418
You pay it?

74
00:06:16,502 --> 00:06:17,420
So what?

75
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:20,505
Nothing!

76
00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:21,965
Please follow me

77
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:25,177
Come into my room…

78
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:27,179
Mr So!

79
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:28,722
Hello…

80
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:29,723
How are you, Madam Pimp?

81
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:31,891
It's very bad of you to call me that!

82
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:33,644
Just be frank, why not?

83
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:34,728
You should be frank!

84
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:37,522
Your hat, is like the mourning uniform!

85
00:06:37,606 --> 00:06:38,941
Has your dad passed away?

86
00:06:40,484 --> 00:06:42,569
I feel happy to talk in this way

87
00:06:43,779 --> 00:06:46,865
Mr Chiu, you helped me to terminate the Hairy Gang,

88
00:06:46,949 --> 00:06:49,076
the emperor will give you award for this

89
00:06:49,868 --> 00:06:51,620
I'll appreciate it if you

90
00:06:51,703 --> 00:06:53,038
speak something nice in front of the emperor

91
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:56,249
Please have the towel

92
00:07:00,462 --> 00:07:02,756
Mr So has come

93
00:07:03,215 --> 00:07:04,758
Congratulations!

94
00:07:04,842 --> 00:07:05,926
This way…

95
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:08,261
Mr So, today is your big day, you must be very happy!

96
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:10,556
We have some new girls, you must be satisfied with them

97
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:11,765
What are they? Gold fish, or cooked fish?

98
00:07:11,849 --> 00:07:13,726
What does that mean?

99
00:07:13,809 --> 00:07:15,769
You idiot! Gold fish is for watching only

100
00:07:15,853 --> 00:07:17,146
Cooked fish can be eaten

101
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:19,606
Cooked fish of course

102
00:07:19,898 --> 00:07:21,775
You, cooked fishes, why don't you come and serve Mr So?

103
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:24,903
Mr So, you are the superior master today

104
00:07:24,987 --> 00:07:26,906
What kind of woman do you want? Just tell me

105
00:07:27,322 --> 00:07:29,407
I won't mind, every woman is just the same

106
00:07:29,491 --> 00:07:30,534
Nothing special

107
00:07:36,248 --> 00:07:37,791
Mr So, what's the matter?

108
00:07:38,584 --> 00:07:39,710
I am attacked

109
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:40,460
What? Who dared so?

110
00:07:40,544 --> 00:07:42,171
I will hit that bastard's mouth for you

111
00:07:42,254 --> 00:07:43,172
She didn't use her mouth

112
00:07:43,255 --> 00:07:44,339
She used her eyes

113
00:07:44,423 --> 00:07:47,343
Tempting, and I smell blood. I haven't seen such eyesight before.

114
00:07:48,093 --> 00:07:49,970
Who is she?

115
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:52,055
Miss Yushang comes to be a part-time hooker only

116
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:54,224
Is Mr Chiu interested to sleep with her?

117
00:07:54,308 --> 00:07:55,643
You should ask His Majesty first

118
00:07:55,726 --> 00:07:57,061
How is it? Your Majesty?

119
00:07:57,686 --> 00:08:00,314
We are friends, just go ahead if you want!

120
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:02,149
Mr Chiu, help yourself

121
00:08:03,108 --> 00:08:04,443
Thank you then

122
00:08:04,526 --> 00:08:05,485
The room service please

123
00:08:05,861 --> 00:08:08,864
Yushang, come and greet Mr Chiu

124
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:12,867
Sister, he is the one we want

125
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:14,369
He killed dad

126
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:15,746
I know, stay calm

127
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:16,496
Let's go

128
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:17,498
May I be excused?

129
00:08:17,581 --> 00:08:19,249
Mr Chiu, Miss Yushang has arrived

130
00:08:22,127 --> 00:08:25,756
How are you, Mr Chiu?

131
00:08:30,886 --> 00:08:31,929
A pretty woman!

132
00:08:33,764 --> 00:08:36,642
Mr Chiu, about tonight…

133
00:08:36,725 --> 00:08:37,851
$100,000

134
00:08:37,935 --> 00:08:40,855
if Miss Yushang sleeps with our young master tonight…

135
00:08:40,938 --> 00:08:42,523
You are not welcome

136
00:08:42,606 --> 00:08:45,400
I am sorry, I am damn sorry

137
00:08:45,484 --> 00:08:46,527
Don't you have any objection?

138
00:08:47,611 --> 00:08:50,155
Let me say something fair

139
00:08:50,239 --> 00:08:51,574
If any of you can offer

140
00:08:51,657 --> 00:08:52,950
more than $100,000

141
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:54,701
Yushang will sleep with whomever

142
00:08:54,785 --> 00:08:56,412
Don't quarrel because of such small amount,

143
00:08:56,495 --> 00:08:58,038
isn't it right?

144
00:08:58,121 --> 00:08:59,789
Pal, you are a big spender

145
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:02,876
The cheque is too simple to me

146
00:09:04,628 --> 00:09:08,465
I have a pearl which is granted by the Royal family, it's invaluable!

147
00:09:11,969 --> 00:09:13,679
I love the pearl more

148
00:09:15,597 --> 00:09:18,266
Mr Chiu, I will wait for you in my room

149
00:09:19,101 --> 00:09:20,811
Is the pearl worth $100,000?

150
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:23,855
Don't you think that's too little for you?

151
00:09:23,939 --> 00:09:25,149
I love money too

152
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:27,401
But, I don't like you

153
00:09:31,113 --> 00:09:33,574
You are frank! I love it very much

154
00:09:33,657 --> 00:09:34,616
Mr So…

155
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:35,534
It doesn't matter,

156
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:37,244
I think, my hat doesn't match me

157
00:09:37,369 --> 00:09:40,414
Yushang doesn't like me, I deserve it

158
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:41,707
I am glad you understand this

159
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:42,666
Don't worry,

160
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:44,292
I have many pretty girls here

161
00:09:44,376 --> 00:09:47,254
I trust your arrangement

162
00:09:50,215 --> 00:09:51,717
None of my business

163
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,176
How bold are you?

164
00:10:02,811 --> 00:10:05,147
Mantis Fist? It seems to be powerful

165
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:06,189
Music!

166
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:14,781
Keep this

167
00:10:15,991 --> 00:10:16,617
See my Crane's Fists!

168
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:17,451
The Tiger's Claws!

169
00:10:22,456 --> 00:10:25,376
How can a mantis fight with a tiger?

170
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:27,753
I know Tiger Claws and Crane's Fists too!

171
00:10:29,421 --> 00:10:31,173
Well, try me, mantis!

172
00:10:44,728 --> 00:10:46,605
Bravo…

173
00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:48,982
Your Tiger's claws are defeated

174
00:10:51,109 --> 00:10:52,277
Actually it's not Tiger's Claws,

175
00:10:52,361 --> 00:10:53,821
it's beggar's fists!

176
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:55,322
That's why it's too weak

177
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:02,996
You move fast!

178
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:04,456
It seems to be powerful…

179
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:09,294
Kid, you don't know how the wind blows

180
00:11:16,552 --> 00:11:17,970
The general of Canton has arrived

181
00:11:18,053 --> 00:11:20,764
Get lost…

182
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:23,391
Who dares bully my son? Let me teach him a lesson.

183
00:11:24,226 --> 00:11:25,018
Master

184
00:11:25,102 --> 00:11:26,562
Don't panic, Chan who bullied you?

185
00:11:26,645 --> 00:11:27,563
It's me who bullied others

186
00:11:27,646 --> 00:11:29,148
What? You bullied others?

187
00:11:29,523 --> 00:11:31,358
How much does he have? Is he even qualified to be bullied by you?

188
00:11:31,859 --> 00:11:32,818
Master, they are the ones

189
00:11:32,901 --> 00:11:33,360
Who are they?

190
00:11:33,443 --> 00:11:34,819
Just take a look

191
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,114
The King of Iron Hat?

192
00:11:41,118 --> 00:11:42,036
Send the gift

193
00:11:42,119 --> 00:11:42,745
Chan

194
00:11:42,828 --> 00:11:44,371
They sent you such a valuable present, you should stop bullying them.

195
00:11:44,872 --> 00:11:45,998
Come on, give tips to the girls here

196
00:11:46,081 --> 00:11:46,790
Master

197
00:11:46,874 --> 00:11:49,126
King of Iron Hat, Seng-ko-lin-ch'in, is written on the medal.

198
00:11:59,845 --> 00:12:01,305
How dare you seize the medal of His Majesty?

199
00:12:01,805 --> 00:12:02,431
Cuff him

200
00:12:02,514 --> 00:12:04,766
Hold it, according to the Ching's law,

201
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:07,394
Courtiers are not allowed to partake in hooking

202
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:08,895
Now, you are in the brothel

203
00:12:08,979 --> 00:12:11,023
Do you know you have violated the laws of Ching?

204
00:12:11,523 --> 00:12:12,441
How about you?

205
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:14,109
- You mean me?    - Yes!

206
00:12:14,193 --> 00:12:16,237
That's right, I come…

207
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,112
- to arrest…    - You!

208
00:12:17,321 --> 00:12:18,864
- Him!    - Arrest him!

209
00:12:19,323 --> 00:12:20,407
I am the general of Canton,

210
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:22,909
so I should arrest those bad people

211
00:12:22,993 --> 00:12:24,036
By the way…

212
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:25,829
What else? Go ahead

213
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:29,374
Today is the birthday of the Ex-Empress Dowager

214
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:31,627
So your crime is doubled

215
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:32,836
It may result in capital punishment

216
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,423
Kill him…

217
00:12:39,718 --> 00:12:40,886
According to the Ching laws,

218
00:12:40,969 --> 00:12:43,138
anyone without a tail should be killed

219
00:12:43,222 --> 00:12:45,099
So you…

220
00:12:47,976 --> 00:12:49,019
Do you want to see my hair?

221
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:50,395
You can see as much as you want! Fathead.

222
00:12:50,479 --> 00:12:52,856
Cut the crap, just kill him

223
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:54,859
OK, it's finished

224
00:12:55,192 --> 00:12:57,569
General So, let's play happily together, so just forget it.

225
00:12:57,653 --> 00:12:58,988
I haven't played!

226
00:12:59,905 --> 00:13:00,656
Your Majesty,

227
00:13:00,739 --> 00:13:02,991
a rascal has ruined the atmosphere here,

228
00:13:03,075 --> 00:13:03,909
I should be blamed for poor arrangement

229
00:13:04,576 --> 00:13:05,410
None of your business

230
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:07,120
Let's go

231
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:12,626
Master, you can't fool this guy. Let's go.

232
00:13:13,669 --> 00:13:14,295
OK, go

233
00:13:15,546 --> 00:13:17,506
Just forget the trouble

234
00:13:20,384 --> 00:13:22,678
Young master, your hat

235
00:13:29,643 --> 00:13:30,769
He is great!

236
00:13:39,862 --> 00:13:42,782
Uncle Mok, the dishes are all poisoned

237
00:13:42,865 --> 00:13:46,869
Chiu assassinated our Master

238
00:13:46,952 --> 00:13:48,954
and some generals of The Taiping Reign

239
00:13:49,037 --> 00:13:50,539
And he framed us, the Beggars Association, to be the assassins

240
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:52,917
Thus made us

241
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:54,668
to be despised by the world

242
00:13:55,586 --> 00:13:56,962
Saying that we became the dogs of the government

243
00:13:57,504 --> 00:13:59,673
I should ask him to pay for it

244
00:14:01,425 --> 00:14:02,843
His initial power is harmful

245
00:14:02,926 --> 00:14:05,429
Don't take action until he is trapped

246
00:14:05,512 --> 00:14:07,889
Because we can't defeat him even if we group together

247
00:14:08,223 --> 00:14:09,766
I will try my best to seduce him to the bed

248
00:14:11,185 --> 00:14:12,436
Senior, somebody is coming

249
00:14:13,228 --> 00:14:14,271
Get ready…

250
00:14:22,738 --> 00:14:24,198
Miss Yushang, we meet again

251
00:14:24,281 --> 00:14:26,283
Why do you come here? Where is Mister Chiu?

252
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:27,701
The pearl of Mr. Chiu is broken

253
00:14:27,784 --> 00:14:29,744
by Mr. So and became pearl powder

254
00:14:29,828 --> 00:14:31,121
I have drunk it

255
00:14:31,955 --> 00:14:33,832
Don't judge Mr So from his hair,

256
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:36,210
he is really romantic and funny

257
00:14:36,627 --> 00:14:37,294
But…

258
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:39,713
Stop, I have taken his money, 100,000 taels you know?

259
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:41,381
I won't give it back

260
00:14:41,715 --> 00:14:43,550
About the personality of Mr So…

261
00:14:43,634 --> 00:14:45,261
Cut the crap, pimp!

262
00:14:45,344 --> 00:14:46,178
Leave here first

263
00:14:46,261 --> 00:14:47,262
Yes, you are right

264
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:48,388
Miss Seven…

265
00:14:48,472 --> 00:14:49,932
Just accept this

266
00:14:54,728 --> 00:14:55,729
Who is this guy?

267
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:57,189
I don't know

268
00:14:57,231 --> 00:15:00,234
Miss, first of all, I have good news for you

269
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:02,152
I love you

270
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:05,114
To me, this is a bad news

271
00:15:05,697 --> 00:15:07,365
I know you will reply like this

272
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:08,742
Cut the crap

273
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:09,993
I wish to pay you 100 pearls

274
00:15:10,077 --> 00:15:12,997
for your company tonight

275
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,206
I don't want to talk to you

276
00:15:14,289 --> 00:15:15,332
Please get out

277
00:15:17,209 --> 00:15:18,335
I haven't chosen the wrong one

278
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:20,337
OK, I will drink this wine first

279
00:15:21,255 --> 00:15:22,256
No…

280
00:15:28,554 --> 00:15:30,806
It surprised me

281
00:15:32,015 --> 00:15:32,599
Miss

282
00:15:32,683 --> 00:15:33,559
Hands off!

283
00:15:35,686 --> 00:15:36,729
You know Kung Fu?

284
00:15:37,729 --> 00:15:39,439
No, I don't know Kung Fu at all

285
00:15:40,023 --> 00:15:41,942
I beg you, stop bothering me

286
00:15:42,025 --> 00:15:43,151
I won't accompany you

287
00:15:43,235 --> 00:15:45,779
Yushang, no one treats me like this

288
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:48,323
I have found that I am in love with you

289
00:15:50,075 --> 00:15:51,118
What?

290
00:15:51,618 --> 00:15:54,538
I have been in love with you

291
00:15:56,206 --> 00:15:57,332
Are you kidding?

292
00:15:57,708 --> 00:16:00,127
I am not kidding, I decided to marry you

293
00:16:01,253 --> 00:16:02,337
Are you nuts?

294
00:16:04,047 --> 00:16:05,048
Kidding?

295
00:16:07,843 --> 00:16:09,303
Is anyone hiding here?

296
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:14,767
That's good, I want a witness

297
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:15,934
Witness?

298
00:16:16,018 --> 00:16:18,521
Yes, I swear in front of your sword

299
00:16:19,146 --> 00:16:20,814
I do want to marry Miss Yushang as my wife, I am sincere

300
00:16:20,898 --> 00:16:23,067
If I cheat, I will be killed by thunder

301
00:16:24,359 --> 00:16:26,444
Sister, I feel excited for you

302
00:16:26,528 --> 00:16:27,487
Hey

303
00:16:29,072 --> 00:16:30,407
Don't you know it isn't that easy to be my husband?

304
00:16:30,908 --> 00:16:32,326
How can I be your husband?

305
00:16:34,119 --> 00:16:35,871
I want him to be the superior Kung Fu master

306
00:16:35,954 --> 00:16:37,205
Be the top of all

307
00:16:37,289 --> 00:16:38,415
Can you do that?

308
00:16:39,374 --> 00:16:40,333
Let me think for one second

309
00:16:47,132 --> 00:16:48,050
I can do it

310
00:16:49,968 --> 00:16:50,886
OK

311
00:16:50,969 --> 00:16:53,472
Do it first and then look for me

312
00:16:54,348 --> 00:16:57,268
Well, I think we should fix a date for our wedding

313
00:16:57,684 --> 00:17:00,312
Because this is too easy for me to be the Kung Fu scholar!

314
00:17:01,271 --> 00:17:04,816
OK, but you should give me some time to consider it

315
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:07,403
No problem, I will wait for your answer outside the garden

316
00:17:08,362 --> 00:17:09,572
I won't leave until seeing you

317
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,160
Crazy!

318
00:17:38,141 --> 00:17:40,769
We come from the Beggars Association, Those unrelated,  leave at once.

319
00:18:37,826 --> 00:18:40,579
Sir, the timing is right

320
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:42,956
The road is safe now, please go

321
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:47,044
Good, very good

322
00:18:49,588 --> 00:18:50,464
Let's go!

323
00:19:03,018 --> 00:19:05,479
Shit, we are late

324
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:08,398
That Manchurian should be blamed

325
00:19:15,405 --> 00:19:17,240
Sister…

326
00:19:17,324 --> 00:19:18,075
What's the matter?

327
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,368
The idiot is still there

328
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:20,619
Let's kill him

329
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:23,163
Forget it, he doesn't mean to bother us

330
00:19:23,247 --> 00:19:24,540
Let him go

331
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,387
Are you fond of him?

332
00:19:38,929 --> 00:19:39,972
What did you say?

333
00:19:40,055 --> 00:19:41,431
I won't fall in love with anybody

334
00:19:41,515 --> 00:19:43,642
until Chiu is killed

335
00:19:43,725 --> 00:19:44,935
Especially him

336
00:19:45,727 --> 00:19:47,479
Chiu is good at Kung Fu

337
00:19:47,563 --> 00:19:50,900
Mok said, we can't defeat him unless using the "Dragon Killing Palms"

338
00:19:51,984 --> 00:19:53,277
So, I can never marry!

339
00:19:53,819 --> 00:19:55,821
Let's go, if you want to get married

340
00:20:14,548 --> 00:20:16,633
What evil are you? How dare you scare me?

341
00:20:17,676 --> 00:20:20,470
Mr So, it's me!

342
00:20:22,556 --> 00:20:23,515
You are the pimp?!

343
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:24,934
Yes!

344
00:20:25,017 --> 00:20:26,644
You have a flat figure, where is your bust?

345
00:20:26,727 --> 00:20:29,605
It's early in the morning, it hasn't woken up yet.

346
00:20:30,147 --> 00:20:31,690
You're lucky not to have been killed.

347
00:20:31,773 --> 00:20:33,483
Don't go around if you haven't put on your makeup yet.

348
00:20:33,567 --> 00:20:34,651
I won't do it again

349
00:20:35,444 --> 00:20:39,281
Stop waiting for Miss Yushang, she left

350
00:20:40,199 --> 00:20:41,075
What?

351
00:20:45,329 --> 00:20:46,789
Where is she going?

352
00:20:47,581 --> 00:20:51,376
She… she is going to Peking

353
00:20:52,085 --> 00:20:53,086
Peking?

354
00:20:53,712 --> 00:20:58,342
Men should contribute to the country

355
00:20:58,425 --> 00:21:02,429
Where should I put my pigtail?

356
00:21:02,513 --> 00:21:04,515
Swing and swing…

357
00:21:04,598 --> 00:21:06,600
I pull it and play it…

358
00:21:06,683 --> 00:21:07,934
Dad!

359
00:21:08,769 --> 00:21:10,354
I decided to join the examination for the Scholar of Martial Arts.

360
00:21:10,687 --> 00:21:12,063
Chan

361
00:21:12,606 --> 00:21:14,733
I have been longing for this word for 25 years

362
00:21:14,816 --> 00:21:16,568
For our family, you should do that.

363
00:21:16,652 --> 00:21:18,821
Don't misunderstand it, I'm not doing this for anyone,

364
00:21:18,904 --> 00:21:19,696
but for a woman

365
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:20,948
What a hero!

366
00:21:21,323 --> 00:21:23,492
For a girl, you want to be the Scholar of Martial Arts!

367
00:21:23,617 --> 00:21:24,576
Who is that girl?

368
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:26,912
The hooker of Yee Hung Brothel, Miss Yushang

369
00:21:26,995 --> 00:21:28,163
For a hooker?

370
00:21:29,706 --> 00:21:30,707
What's wrong with it?

371
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:34,127
You have different taste, you are great!

372
00:21:34,211 --> 00:21:35,421
I admire you!

373
00:21:35,504 --> 00:21:36,505
I will accompany you to Peking

374
00:21:36,588 --> 00:21:37,798
2, 3, 4, 5, 6

375
00:21:37,881 --> 00:21:40,175
I am coming

376
00:21:40,259 --> 00:21:42,678
Young master is going for the examination, let's move to Peking too

377
00:21:45,055 --> 00:21:46,348
Stop chasing,

378
00:21:46,431 --> 00:21:48,683
we won't take the hens with us

379
00:21:48,767 --> 00:21:52,271
Be careful!

380
00:21:52,354 --> 00:21:54,773
If you break my stuff, I will teach you a good lesson.

381
00:21:55,399 --> 00:21:56,358
Be careful!

382
00:21:57,401 --> 00:21:58,152
Good morning, Dad.

383
00:21:58,235 --> 00:21:58,819
Good morning

384
00:21:58,902 --> 00:21:59,778
You want to move everything to Peking?

385
00:21:59,862 --> 00:22:00,613
Sure

386
00:22:00,696 --> 00:22:02,364
Please leave me a cloth.

387
00:22:02,447 --> 00:22:04,157
You are only a kid, you don't need this

388
00:22:04,575 --> 00:22:05,534
But I am not small.

389
00:22:07,119 --> 00:22:09,455
Are you bigger than mine?

390
00:22:09,746 --> 00:22:10,538
You despise me!

391
00:22:10,622 --> 00:22:11,623
Mine will be bigger than yours one day

392
00:22:11,707 --> 00:22:14,585
Let's find something, say trousers to cover it

393
00:22:15,043 --> 00:22:15,877
I don't want to see it

394
00:22:15,961 --> 00:22:18,714
Why are you standing here for? Why don't you remove it?

395
00:22:20,132 --> 00:22:21,759
It's a hard job to remove such a big house!

396
00:22:21,842 --> 00:22:23,635
Please, work hard men!

397
00:22:23,719 --> 00:22:27,514
Ready, 1, 2, 3, push!

398
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:31,477
Push!

399
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,686
Be careful!

400
00:22:33,061 --> 00:22:34,646
Tie it well…

401
00:22:34,688 --> 00:22:35,981
Master, do you want to move the tree too?

402
00:22:36,064 --> 00:22:37,107
Sure,

403
00:22:37,191 --> 00:22:39,193
or how can I eat lychee in Peking?

404
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:41,278
Push it over…

405
00:22:42,446 --> 00:22:45,532
Be careful

406
00:22:45,616 --> 00:22:48,244
Take care of my lychee, you fathead!

407
00:22:49,328 --> 00:22:51,455
Chiu helped me to terminate

408
00:22:51,538 --> 00:22:55,876
the Hairy Gang in Kwangsi

409
00:22:55,959 --> 00:22:58,753
So I bring him here to greet Your Majesty

410
00:22:59,922 --> 00:23:04,552
Fine, I am now appointing you to be the Deputy Secretary

411
00:23:05,969 --> 00:23:08,972
Hope you will serve our Ching Dynasty wholeheartedly.

412
00:23:09,598 --> 00:23:10,682
Thank you, Your Majesty

413
00:23:10,933 --> 00:23:14,019
Your Majesty, Mr Chiu is a magician

414
00:23:14,478 --> 00:23:17,398
Why don't you ask him to show you something?

415
00:23:17,481 --> 00:23:18,691
Magic?

416
00:23:21,026 --> 00:23:23,737
Mr Chiu, then show me your magic

417
00:23:23,862 --> 00:23:25,155
Yes, Your Majesty

418
00:25:40,999 --> 00:25:42,125
There is nothing surprising. Go.

419
00:25:42,251 --> 00:25:43,210
Yes

420
00:25:56,765 --> 00:25:59,685
I am sorry for scaring you

421
00:26:00,143 --> 00:26:02,354
If this girl is real, that's fantastic!

422
00:26:04,398 --> 00:26:05,733
Hurry up!

423
00:26:06,149 --> 00:26:08,693
What's the matter?

424
00:26:08,777 --> 00:26:11,780
Come on, go in

425
00:26:12,739 --> 00:26:13,740
What's the matter?

426
00:26:13,824 --> 00:26:16,952
Hide inside

427
00:26:19,037 --> 00:26:19,871
Get ready, young master

428
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:21,915
Come on

429
00:26:22,916 --> 00:26:24,418
Freeze, don't move

430
00:26:29,506 --> 00:26:32,551
Sweet smell, are you Piu Hung?

431
00:26:32,634 --> 00:26:34,928
You are great! I love it

432
00:26:35,929 --> 00:26:37,097
Closer

433
00:26:38,098 --> 00:26:40,350
So big! You must be small!

434
00:26:40,767 --> 00:26:43,561
You are bad, how can you say so to me?

435
00:26:43,645 --> 00:26:44,521
You are big!

436
00:26:47,107 --> 00:26:49,610
What? Pregnant woman? You can't cheat me

437
00:26:49,693 --> 00:26:50,611
You are a dad.

438
00:26:50,694 --> 00:26:53,906
How bad are you, how can you guess that?

439
00:26:53,989 --> 00:26:55,324
Good boy

440
00:26:55,407 --> 00:26:59,536
I wanted to trick you actually, you are really smart

441
00:27:00,746 --> 00:27:03,290
Young master has to join the examination tomorrow,

442
00:27:03,373 --> 00:27:04,165
stop playing

443
00:27:04,249 --> 00:27:05,417
Get out…

444
00:27:06,585 --> 00:27:08,587
Chan, have you prepared

445
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:09,921
for your examination?

446
00:27:10,005 --> 00:27:12,549
What should I prepare? I must win, don't you know that?

447
00:27:12,674 --> 00:27:13,758
Yes I do!

448
00:27:14,843 --> 00:27:17,137
I have faith in you from seeing your behaviour!

449
00:27:17,804 --> 00:27:19,764
Chan, this is Uncle Cheng

450
00:27:19,848 --> 00:27:21,141
He will be the examiner

451
00:27:21,225 --> 00:27:22,393
Say hello to Uncle Cheng

452
00:27:23,143 --> 00:27:25,437
How are you, Uncle Cheng?

453
00:27:28,357 --> 00:27:29,817
See

454
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:32,152
Doesn't he seem to be the winner?

455
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,321
It depends on the fate

456
00:27:35,405 --> 00:27:37,407
Cheng, I've asked someone

457
00:27:37,783 --> 00:27:39,118
to finish the papers which you gave me

458
00:27:39,493 --> 00:27:40,327
Will the questions be changed?

459
00:27:41,036 --> 00:27:42,704
Don't worry about the question paper

460
00:27:42,996 --> 00:27:44,247
But for the test of arrow shooting,

461
00:27:44,331 --> 00:27:45,958
riding, boxing and weapons…

462
00:27:46,041 --> 00:27:47,417
He should try his best

463
00:27:47,501 --> 00:27:48,460
Don't worry

464
00:27:48,544 --> 00:27:50,755
My son is keen in martial arts

465
00:27:50,838 --> 00:27:54,175
So, can I deduct some from the payment of 2 million taels?

466
00:27:54,258 --> 00:27:56,719
We are friends, but that is business

467
00:28:04,226 --> 00:28:08,230
Let the horse teams be the pioneers

468
00:28:08,313 --> 00:28:10,816
The arrow teams go sideways, the gunmen stay back

469
00:28:42,347 --> 00:28:47,227
The candidates come in

470
00:29:42,115 --> 00:29:43,074
I can't lift it

471
00:29:45,911 --> 00:29:46,829
I don't want to waste my force

472
00:29:46,912 --> 00:29:49,373
Shameless? Damn you!

473
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:18,652
Oh, 10 marks

474
00:31:43,529 --> 00:31:46,115
The final race starts now

475
00:31:47,366 --> 00:31:48,492
The candidates,

476
00:31:48,575 --> 00:31:50,744
Po Ye Tat Tor from Mongolia

477
00:31:51,203 --> 00:31:54,873
Bravo…

478
00:31:54,957 --> 00:31:57,334
And So Cha Ha Yee Chan from Canton

479
00:32:00,754 --> 00:32:01,797
Last call

480
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:04,883
So, one to ten Po, one to one

481
00:32:05,801 --> 00:32:09,054
Are you kidding, how can the betting rates differ so much?

482
00:32:09,471 --> 00:32:11,723
One to ten for Chan? Kidding?

483
00:32:12,182 --> 00:32:13,767
Why don't you have faith in Chan?

484
00:32:13,892 --> 00:32:18,230
That is, Chan defaulted in weight lifting

485
00:32:18,313 --> 00:32:21,566
Look, Po entered the final race

486
00:32:21,650 --> 00:32:24,361
with full marks, it differs

487
00:32:24,528 --> 00:32:27,614
It's an examination for the Scholar of Martial Arts, not king of coolies.

488
00:32:28,115 --> 00:32:29,658
It's meaningless to be the champion of weight lifting

489
00:32:29,741 --> 00:32:31,201
You shouldn't put it that way

490
00:32:31,285 --> 00:32:32,328
What?

491
00:32:32,411 --> 00:32:33,746
He is smart

492
00:32:33,829 --> 00:32:36,040
I've studied this race for a long time

493
00:32:36,123 --> 00:32:37,750
I feel strange about the rate too

494
00:32:37,833 --> 00:32:41,670
Po is smart and strong

495
00:32:41,753 --> 00:32:44,422
But see the sweat of his neck

496
00:32:44,506 --> 00:32:46,925
I think it's because he is getting tired

497
00:32:47,009 --> 00:32:47,718
Really?

498
00:32:48,719 --> 00:32:50,012
But this So

499
00:32:50,095 --> 00:32:51,013
What do you think?

500
00:32:51,096 --> 00:32:52,347
He has been disappointing the audience

501
00:32:52,431 --> 00:32:55,309
But he has worked very hard.

502
00:32:55,434 --> 00:32:56,852
What?

503
00:32:56,935 --> 00:33:00,397
He tried very hard

504
00:33:00,522 --> 00:33:03,316
So I want to bet on him

505
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,193
How much do you want to bet?

506
00:33:05,736 --> 00:33:07,029
800,000 taels

507
00:33:07,112 --> 00:33:09,656
Why not 2 million taels?

508
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:12,034
What? Why are you so optimistic about Chan?

509
00:33:12,117 --> 00:33:13,660
You have good analysis.

510
00:33:13,744 --> 00:33:14,411
I feel Chan

511
00:33:14,494 --> 00:33:16,496
will be the champion

512
00:33:17,456 --> 00:33:19,083
Come on

513
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:21,168
I want to bet more on him

514
00:33:21,251 --> 00:33:21,918
Really?

515
00:33:22,044 --> 00:33:22,836
2 million taels!

516
00:33:23,795 --> 00:33:24,921
How generous!

517
00:33:25,714 --> 00:33:27,216
Why don't you bet?

518
00:33:27,508 --> 00:33:29,719
Why should I bet? He is my son

519
00:33:31,261 --> 00:33:34,264
Shit, I missed one thing in my calculation.

520
00:33:34,681 --> 00:33:35,515
What?

521
00:33:35,599 --> 00:33:36,558
The blood

522
00:33:38,727 --> 00:33:40,687
Here comes the Examiner

523
00:33:43,857 --> 00:33:44,858
What? Isn't Cheng the examiner?

524
00:33:49,363 --> 00:33:50,364
Please take a seat

525
00:33:53,158 --> 00:33:54,201
Seng-ko-lin-ch'in?!

526
00:33:54,701 --> 00:33:55,535
What's the problem?

527
00:33:56,870 --> 00:33:59,289
He is the uncle of Po

528
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:02,751
Let's start

529
00:34:07,256 --> 00:34:08,507
Start!

530
00:34:39,037 --> 00:34:41,122
Bravo…

531
00:34:41,498 --> 00:34:44,418
They should add 2 more marks for that powerful shot

532
00:34:44,501 --> 00:34:46,253
I do think so

533
00:34:49,506 --> 00:34:53,010
So's arrow isn't on the target, Po won this section

534
00:34:59,766 --> 00:35:02,310
Kidding? Damn you! They are cheating

535
00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:08,901
Candidates, please get on the horses.

536
00:35:11,987 --> 00:35:12,946
Mr Chiu

537
00:35:17,034 --> 00:35:19,662
Take these with you, maybe you will find them useful

538
00:35:20,329 --> 00:35:22,832
Here comes the 2nd round

539
00:35:53,237 --> 00:35:54,572
They're tricking us again.

540
00:35:55,489 --> 00:35:58,450
It's corrupt! May I give up my bet?

541
00:36:22,975 --> 00:36:24,351
Chan won this race

542
00:36:24,852 --> 00:36:25,895
Did you tear the ticket?

543
00:36:25,978 --> 00:36:27,271
Not yet

544
00:36:40,534 --> 00:36:41,910
Are you kidding?

545
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,056
Once again?!

546
00:37:51,146 --> 00:37:52,939
OK, let's start from the very beginning. I'll fight with a single hand and leg.

547
00:37:53,065 --> 00:37:54,441
I won't take your advantage

548
00:38:05,619 --> 00:38:07,329
How can you use such dirty stance?

549
00:38:07,412 --> 00:38:09,039
Have you woken up?

550
00:38:09,831 --> 00:38:11,416
Bravo! He won!

551
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:13,419
Have some tea

552
00:38:13,502 --> 00:38:14,712
All the best!

553
00:38:15,212 --> 00:38:16,755
What did

554
00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:17,590
you say?

555
00:38:17,673 --> 00:38:19,466
It's English

556
00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:20,551
It's English

557
00:38:21,093 --> 00:38:22,553
There is no regulation stating that weapons are not allowed.

558
00:38:22,970 --> 00:38:26,265
You fell down first, so Po is the winner again.

559
00:38:30,185 --> 00:38:31,395
Damn you Cheng!

560
00:38:31,562 --> 00:38:33,397
You betrayed me!

561
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,856
I will beat you to death

562
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:35,941
if I see you again

563
00:38:36,608 --> 00:38:38,110
Forget it, you won't see him anymore

564
00:38:38,193 --> 00:38:38,944
Why?

565
00:38:39,027 --> 00:38:39,903
I am now going to kill him!

566
00:38:39,987 --> 00:38:40,863
I don't have 2 million to lose!

567
00:38:42,948 --> 00:38:43,991
Just kidding

568
00:38:44,408 --> 00:38:45,492
You are shameless

569
00:38:45,742 --> 00:38:50,121
Po is the Scholar of Martial Arts

570
00:38:50,664 --> 00:38:52,791
I did win! Objection!

571
00:39:10,893 --> 00:39:11,936
What are you doing?

572
00:39:12,019 --> 00:39:15,606
The dart is poisoned

573
00:39:17,524 --> 00:39:19,401
He deserves it!

574
00:39:22,863 --> 00:39:24,615
He was poisoned by his own dart

575
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:27,826
Well, my son will be the Scholar then

576
00:39:27,951 --> 00:39:28,869
I am going to be rich!

577
00:39:28,994 --> 00:39:30,204
Yes!

578
00:39:39,254 --> 00:39:41,381
Thank you, my ancestors!

579
00:39:41,465 --> 00:39:42,633
You have good judgement

580
00:39:45,469 --> 00:39:47,471
Sir, His Majesty wants to appoint the title himself

581
00:39:55,437 --> 00:39:59,399
I want to take a statement from you for the record

582
00:39:59,525 --> 00:40:02,111
You won this time, who are you going to thank?

583
00:40:02,194 --> 00:40:03,362
Miss Yushang!

584
00:40:04,655 --> 00:40:07,533
Is Miss Yushang your mom?

585
00:40:12,246 --> 00:40:14,749
Long life to you!

586
00:40:15,332 --> 00:40:15,999
Please get up

587
00:40:16,083 --> 00:40:17,126
Thank you

588
00:40:19,044 --> 00:40:21,755
Who is the new Scholar of Martial Arts?

589
00:40:24,007 --> 00:40:27,052
Your Majesty, So Chan from Canton is the Scholar this year

590
00:40:30,347 --> 00:40:32,516
Your Majesty, I am So Cha Ha Yee Chan

591
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:36,728
Your Majesty, I want to report something

592
00:40:39,648 --> 00:40:40,399
Go ahead

593
00:40:42,192 --> 00:40:44,194
I have found that So is illiterate

594
00:40:44,653 --> 00:40:46,280
So how could he answer the question paper of strategy?

595
00:40:46,363 --> 00:40:47,364
That must be a trick.

596
00:40:52,077 --> 00:40:53,203
Take the stationery out!

597
00:40:53,287 --> 00:40:54,288
Yes

598
00:40:59,251 --> 00:41:02,546
So Cha Ha Yee Chan, write your name now

599
00:41:04,631 --> 00:41:07,008
Thank God, he knows how to write his name!

600
00:41:07,092 --> 00:41:08,760
He can write his name!

601
00:41:22,191 --> 00:41:22,983
I don't know how to write

602
00:41:24,985 --> 00:41:26,111
That's shit!

603
00:41:27,112 --> 00:41:28,071
Kill him now

604
00:41:28,655 --> 00:41:29,823
No! No!

605
00:41:32,034 --> 00:41:33,369
Your Majesty, I am the one who cheated

606
00:41:33,452 --> 00:41:34,328
It's none of his business

607
00:41:34,411 --> 00:41:35,370
Just chop me to death

608
00:41:35,454 --> 00:41:36,664
No, you should kill me

609
00:41:36,830 --> 00:41:37,497
Sorry dad

610
00:41:37,581 --> 00:41:38,665
I don't know how to write my name

611
00:41:38,749 --> 00:41:39,833
Stop, I already know it.

612
00:41:39,958 --> 00:41:41,418
Your Majesty, I should be killed

613
00:41:41,543 --> 00:41:42,127
Kill me

614
00:41:42,211 --> 00:41:43,003
No, kill me

615
00:41:43,086 --> 00:41:43,795
Kill me

616
00:41:43,879 --> 00:41:44,588
Your Majesty, you'd better kill me

617
00:41:44,671 --> 00:41:46,798
Shit, are you giving orders?

618
00:41:47,382 --> 00:41:48,633
You two cooperated to cheat me.

619
00:41:49,343 --> 00:41:51,053
The Secretary for Justice, announce the penalty for them

620
00:41:52,012 --> 00:41:55,307
Come out! Hurry up

621
00:41:55,933 --> 00:41:57,852
I am here!

622
00:42:01,939 --> 00:42:02,940
He is the Secretary for Justice

623
00:42:03,607 --> 00:42:05,943
So's family should be

624
00:42:06,026 --> 00:42:07,402
sentenced to death

625
00:42:09,363 --> 00:42:11,949
But their ancestors achieved a lot for the Ching. They can be exempted.

626
00:42:12,032 --> 00:42:15,160
But, their fortune should be forfeited

627
00:42:15,953 --> 00:42:16,996
Have you carried out any military duty?

628
00:42:17,579 --> 00:42:19,706
I haven't gone back to my camp for 7 years, I haven't done anything

629
00:42:21,166 --> 00:42:23,669
So, he didn't miscarry out any duty

630
00:42:25,295 --> 00:42:25,796
So, the maximum penalty

631
00:42:25,879 --> 00:42:28,590
is forfeiture of property only

632
00:42:32,386 --> 00:42:34,138
What? Are you sure?

633
00:42:34,888 --> 00:42:36,515
I am fair

634
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:38,976
I judge it from the Law Book

635
00:42:40,602 --> 00:42:42,062
Can I add something?

636
00:42:42,938 --> 00:42:45,607
Sure, since you are the Emperor

637
00:42:46,024 --> 00:42:48,735
I want them to be beggars for the rest of their lives

638
00:42:49,278 --> 00:42:51,447
Why couldn't you find out they cheated during the examination?

639
00:42:51,989 --> 00:42:53,199
Luckily Chiu reported it to me on time

640
00:42:53,282 --> 00:42:56,202
Chiu, you will be rewarded

641
00:42:58,871 --> 00:43:02,666
I am wandering…

642
00:43:02,749 --> 00:43:05,043
That's the spirit tablet of my dad, do you want to take it too?

643
00:43:07,129 --> 00:43:09,048
It's useless for you

644
00:43:09,131 --> 00:43:19,391
How poor are we…

645
00:43:19,474 --> 00:43:25,855
I am thinking of my better half…

646
00:43:25,939 --> 00:43:26,940
Young master,

647
00:43:27,691 --> 00:43:28,817
from now on,

648
00:43:28,901 --> 00:43:30,903
you should work hard to learn how to write

649
00:43:34,948 --> 00:43:41,788
But I can't sell the affection…

650
00:43:45,250 --> 00:43:46,168
Professor

651
00:43:47,711 --> 00:43:48,712
I will learn it

652
00:43:49,796 --> 00:43:54,426
I regret that…

653
00:43:54,968 --> 00:43:57,637
Master, I will take good care of the little turtle

654
00:43:57,804 --> 00:43:59,055
I am sorry

655
00:43:59,139 --> 00:44:01,725
We haven't given birth to any baby of yours

656
00:44:01,808 --> 00:44:03,059
It doesn't matter

657
00:44:03,143 --> 00:44:05,145
It's all my fault

658
00:44:05,312 --> 00:44:06,104
If I did better,

659
00:44:06,188 --> 00:44:08,107
you could have many babies

660
00:44:08,190 --> 00:44:08,899
But I think

661
00:44:09,024 --> 00:44:10,943
Chan is enough for me

662
00:44:12,194 --> 00:44:13,362
Why are you standing here? Go now

663
00:44:13,487 --> 00:44:15,030
Master, we are leaving

664
00:44:15,113 --> 00:44:16,156
We are leaving, master

665
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:17,450
Go, go now

666
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:21,161
We are free

667
00:44:21,745 --> 00:44:23,705
I feel so happy

668
00:44:25,916 --> 00:44:27,793
How happy are we!

669
00:44:28,377 --> 00:44:29,628
Go in…

670
00:44:29,711 --> 00:44:30,921
Hurry up…

671
00:44:31,004 --> 00:44:32,172
How is it?

672
00:44:33,173 --> 00:44:34,716
Why are they so happy?

673
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:35,968
What happened?

674
00:44:36,009 --> 00:44:37,886
I am very happy

675
00:44:38,428 --> 00:44:39,930
Please go in…

676
00:44:40,013 --> 00:44:41,014
Welcome…

677
00:44:41,974 --> 00:44:45,144
Damn sequestration, I want to cry, my son

678
00:44:45,227 --> 00:44:47,354
Hold it, don't lose our face

679
00:44:47,437 --> 00:44:48,438
Keep on laughing

680
00:44:50,107 --> 00:44:52,276
Son

681
00:44:52,359 --> 00:44:53,652
Have you kept any money?

682
00:44:53,735 --> 00:44:54,945
No, how about you?

683
00:44:55,028 --> 00:44:56,446
I forgot that

684
00:44:59,074 --> 00:45:02,494
Shit, damn sequestration!

685
00:45:04,788 --> 00:45:08,458
Be merciful,

686
00:45:09,001 --> 00:45:10,461
please give money to us

687
00:45:10,544 --> 00:45:12,296
Son, that guy is like Dad

688
00:45:13,005 --> 00:45:14,048
You mean the one who sings?

689
00:45:14,464 --> 00:45:16,341
No, the one who pays

690
00:45:16,425 --> 00:45:18,886
He is more disgusting than the one who sings

691
00:45:18,969 --> 00:45:21,555
Not exactly, he is smart

692
00:45:23,056 --> 00:45:24,140
Dad should be blamed

693
00:45:24,224 --> 00:45:25,976
I always called you beggar

694
00:45:26,310 --> 00:45:27,436
Now, it becomes true

695
00:45:27,519 --> 00:45:28,478
What's wrong with you?

696
00:45:28,562 --> 00:45:29,813
The emperor wants us to be beggars

697
00:45:29,938 --> 00:45:31,273
Do you think we'd be beggars?

698
00:45:31,356 --> 00:45:33,400
I am smart, I am keen on Kung Fu fighting

699
00:45:33,483 --> 00:45:35,276
Even the gods won't let me be a beggar

700
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:36,319
That's true

701
00:45:36,403 --> 00:45:37,237
Am I like a beggar?

702
00:45:37,321 --> 00:45:38,322
No

703
00:45:39,072 --> 00:45:40,949
Buy something to eat, you beggars

704
00:45:43,076 --> 00:45:45,120
You treat us as beggars?

705
00:45:45,204 --> 00:45:46,997
Damn you!

706
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:49,499
It's weird! Let's eat

707
00:45:53,003 --> 00:45:54,963
Chan, since we have nothing to do

708
00:45:55,047 --> 00:45:56,382
Let me take a seat,

709
00:45:56,507 --> 00:45:57,925
Maybe we can have something to eat tonight

710
00:45:58,008 --> 00:45:59,384
You are treating yourself like a beggar?

711
00:45:59,968 --> 00:46:01,052
Dad, don't worry

712
00:46:01,094 --> 00:46:02,846
I don't need to beg for money

713
00:46:02,930 --> 00:46:04,098
How can you get money if you don't beg?

714
00:46:04,181 --> 00:46:05,099
Just ask someone to give us money

715
00:46:05,265 --> 00:46:06,808
Pal, may I know your name?

716
00:46:08,018 --> 00:46:08,852
Nau Tai Chung

717
00:46:08,936 --> 00:46:10,062
Do you have money?

718
00:46:10,145 --> 00:46:10,896
Yes

719
00:46:10,979 --> 00:46:11,855
Just give it to me

720
00:46:11,939 --> 00:46:12,648
OK

721
00:46:17,277 --> 00:46:18,069
Thank you

722
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:20,113
Why should I give you money?

723
00:46:20,822 --> 00:46:21,865
Why do you ask so many questions?

724
00:46:21,949 --> 00:46:23,284
But I should know the reason

725
00:46:23,367 --> 00:46:25,411
Anyway, you should pay it

726
00:46:25,494 --> 00:46:27,538
No, let's fix it up first

727
00:46:29,998 --> 00:46:31,374
Just give it to us, why are you asking so much?

728
00:46:31,458 --> 00:46:32,167
Hands off

729
00:46:32,251 --> 00:46:33,085
You mean robbing?

730
00:46:33,126 --> 00:46:34,586
Robbery…

731
00:46:35,754 --> 00:46:37,464
I am not robbing, I am begging

732
00:46:37,548 --> 00:46:41,385
Begging? How dare you, you beggar, you are cheating me!

733
00:46:41,468 --> 00:46:44,554
Don't you think I am stupid? I am smart, you know?

734
00:46:44,638 --> 00:46:45,681
Hey, two days passed,

735
00:46:45,764 --> 00:46:47,641
It's cold and I am hungry now

736
00:46:47,724 --> 00:46:49,476
Have you had any idea?

737
00:46:49,852 --> 00:46:50,728
I have a friend's girlfriend

738
00:46:51,144 --> 00:46:53,647
who is living in Peking

739
00:46:54,940 --> 00:46:56,859
She always admires you

740
00:46:56,942 --> 00:46:58,110
Really?

741
00:46:58,151 --> 00:47:01,112
Yes, if you are willing to date her

742
00:47:01,154 --> 00:47:03,698
I think she will help us to go back to Canton

743
00:47:03,782 --> 00:47:06,243
But, you have to sacrifice

744
00:47:06,326 --> 00:47:07,494
Do you mean…

745
00:47:07,578 --> 00:47:10,039
For our family, just as you said

746
00:47:10,122 --> 00:47:11,874
I know it's very hard for you

747
00:47:11,957 --> 00:47:13,083
Cut the crap, let's go and find her

748
00:47:13,167 --> 00:47:14,168
I have arranged it

749
00:47:14,793 --> 00:47:17,254
The one wearing the red dress who stands under the lantern, that's her

750
00:47:23,594 --> 00:47:24,595
Ghost!

751
00:47:30,058 --> 00:47:30,892
It's to your benefit!

752
00:47:30,976 --> 00:47:33,103
Why don't you go yourself?

753
00:47:47,326 --> 00:47:49,245
Chan, I haven't tried this before

754
00:47:49,328 --> 00:47:50,162
Be careful!

755
00:47:50,245 --> 00:47:51,538
Don't worry

756
00:47:51,622 --> 00:47:52,456
I'll take care of you

757
00:47:52,539 --> 00:47:54,207
You want to earn money for shark fin, right?

758
00:47:54,291 --> 00:47:55,167
Right…

759
00:47:57,211 --> 00:48:00,172
Get lost…

760
00:48:00,297 --> 00:48:01,507
No show here

761
00:48:05,219 --> 00:48:07,138
We just want to earn some money

762
00:48:07,221 --> 00:48:08,222
to go back to Canton

763
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:11,183
Don't be that mean to us

764
00:48:13,352 --> 00:48:14,311
It's the Royal instruction that the So family be beggars for life.

765
00:48:14,645 --> 00:48:17,022
the So's family'd be beggars for life

766
00:48:17,147 --> 00:48:19,191
You two can only be beggars

767
00:48:19,691 --> 00:48:21,902
I am only carrying out my duty. Men!

768
00:48:22,027 --> 00:48:22,653
Yes!

769
00:48:22,736 --> 00:48:23,528
Remove all the things

770
00:48:23,612 --> 00:48:24,613
Yes

771
00:48:27,491 --> 00:48:28,784
Help!

772
00:48:28,825 --> 00:48:30,744
Master Chiu, it's hard for one to carry it

773
00:48:30,827 --> 00:48:33,496
Ask more men to remove it

774
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:34,623
Yes

775
00:48:37,167 --> 00:48:38,001
What do you want?

776
00:48:38,085 --> 00:48:39,044
No, we can't move it

777
00:48:39,127 --> 00:48:39,794
Let me do it

778
00:48:39,878 --> 00:48:40,754
You want a fight, don't you?

779
00:48:42,089 --> 00:48:43,591
Last time you escaped from Yee Hung Hostel,

780
00:48:44,007 --> 00:48:45,425
But you won't be that lucky this time

781
00:48:49,972 --> 00:48:50,890
He is powerful!

782
00:48:50,973 --> 00:48:51,932
I have to defeat him

783
00:48:52,015 --> 00:48:53,433
by one powerful strike

784
00:48:53,517 --> 00:48:55,477
I can't give him another chance to counterattack

785
00:49:16,623 --> 00:49:20,085
Chan…

786
00:49:20,169 --> 00:49:22,338
Chan…

787
00:49:22,421 --> 00:49:24,256
Your legs and hands

788
00:49:24,381 --> 00:49:25,507
are all broken by me

789
00:49:26,675 --> 00:49:28,260
You will be a cripple for the rest of your life

790
00:49:30,429 --> 00:49:32,723
You want to fight? Not now!

791
00:49:33,557 --> 00:49:36,518
But, you can beg for money

792
00:49:37,269 --> 00:49:38,395
Be a good beggar

793
00:49:40,272 --> 00:49:44,151
Go, go away…

794
00:49:52,534 --> 00:49:56,246
Don't panic, Chan, it's OK

795
00:49:57,539 --> 00:50:03,670
Don't panic, you'll be alright… Chan!

796
00:50:05,297 --> 00:50:08,342
I went to the examination hall

797
00:50:08,509 --> 00:50:10,219
with my son,

798
00:50:10,302 --> 00:50:12,304
don't you know who was the examiner?

799
00:50:12,346 --> 00:50:15,140
He is Seng-ko-lin-ch'in, that bastard

800
00:50:15,224 --> 00:50:18,310
He was our enemy!

801
00:50:18,644 --> 00:50:20,146
About our story…

802
00:50:20,229 --> 00:50:21,731
Let me stop here first, I want a smoke

803
00:50:23,357 --> 00:50:25,192
It's better to smoke now

804
00:50:25,275 --> 00:50:27,068
Yes, it's better

805
00:50:27,152 --> 00:50:30,489
We let him go in

806
00:50:30,572 --> 00:50:32,491
the Yee Hung Brothel

807
00:50:32,574 --> 00:50:34,493
But he framed us in return

808
00:50:34,576 --> 00:50:36,661
He tricked my son

809
00:50:36,745 --> 00:50:39,039
during the examination

810
00:50:39,122 --> 00:50:42,334
But, my son was really smart and great

811
00:50:42,376 --> 00:50:44,461
He finally won the race

812
00:50:44,545 --> 00:50:45,463
To be the greatest Kung Fu fighter, invincible

813
00:50:45,546 --> 00:50:47,423
Be the top

814
00:50:47,506 --> 00:50:49,299
Can you do that?

815
00:50:49,383 --> 00:50:50,342
Sure!

816
00:50:50,384 --> 00:50:51,385
Well

817
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:54,221
Come back to me if you can do that

818
00:50:55,889 --> 00:50:57,724
I think we should fix our wedding date first

819
00:50:57,808 --> 00:51:00,728
Because being a scholar is too simple for me.

820
00:51:10,529 --> 00:51:11,613
Write your name at once

821
00:51:14,783 --> 00:51:15,534
I don't know how to write

822
00:51:26,253 --> 00:51:28,797
Chan, what's wrong with you?

823
00:51:32,176 --> 00:51:33,260
Nightmare again?

824
00:51:34,887 --> 00:51:35,971
Don't think so much!

825
00:51:43,187 --> 00:51:44,105
Although you have taken

826
00:51:44,313 --> 00:51:45,898
2 months' rest,

827
00:51:46,732 --> 00:51:48,150
your legs and hands have not totally recovered

828
00:51:49,610 --> 00:51:50,778
Coming

829
00:51:51,153 --> 00:51:53,822
I am going to beg for food

830
00:51:54,281 --> 00:51:55,616
I will make the last herbal tea

831
00:51:55,699 --> 00:51:56,742
for you later

832
00:51:57,367 --> 00:51:59,160
Dad, you go begging again?

833
00:51:59,661 --> 00:52:01,705
This job should be left to me

834
00:52:01,788 --> 00:52:03,331
You are the Scholar…

835
00:52:06,585 --> 00:52:09,880
Chan, to be a beggar,

836
00:52:09,963 --> 00:52:11,715
there are some lessons!

837
00:52:12,257 --> 00:52:14,760
You can't just show your hand and beg for money

838
00:52:14,843 --> 00:52:17,679
At least you should have a bowl, that represents your class

839
00:52:17,763 --> 00:52:20,266
Is it ridiculous?

840
00:52:20,349 --> 00:52:22,351
Hurry up

841
00:52:23,852 --> 00:52:24,978
I am coming

842
00:52:26,188 --> 00:52:27,523
We can't beg well if we are late!

843
00:52:27,606 --> 00:52:28,941
Yes…

844
00:52:48,919 --> 00:52:49,503
Give me money please

845
00:52:49,586 --> 00:52:50,796
Go, go, I won't give you money

846
00:52:50,879 --> 00:52:54,508
Go, don't stop me from doing business

847
00:52:57,970 --> 00:52:59,054
Chan, dad is leaving

848
00:53:11,733 --> 00:53:14,694
Thank you…

849
00:53:21,493 --> 00:53:23,161
Thank you…

850
00:53:30,502 --> 00:53:31,503
Are you that mean?

851
00:53:31,587 --> 00:53:32,713
Why don't you write it yourself?

852
00:53:32,796 --> 00:53:35,590
You are off duty, so I just want to borrow it

853
00:53:36,592 --> 00:53:37,551
Do you think I'm an idiot?

854
00:54:12,586 --> 00:54:13,504
Dad!

855
00:54:15,589 --> 00:54:16,423
What are you doing?

856
00:54:16,882 --> 00:54:20,344
I am cold… I am cold… Chan

857
00:54:22,346 --> 00:54:25,474
No, your body is as hot as fire

858
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:27,351
Are you sick?

859
00:54:27,434 --> 00:54:28,936
I am not…

860
00:54:30,562 --> 00:54:31,396
It's late

861
00:54:32,523 --> 00:54:33,983
I have to search for food

862
00:54:35,984 --> 00:54:37,944
Lie down, I will go this time

863
00:54:38,570 --> 00:54:39,738
Are you going begging?

864
00:54:40,697 --> 00:54:42,616
I have my own way to get food

865
00:54:43,033 --> 00:54:43,992
Take a rest now

866
00:54:44,076 --> 00:54:45,536
I will take you to the doctor after getting some money

867
00:55:05,430 --> 00:55:06,806
You bastard, why don't you eat?

868
00:55:06,890 --> 00:55:09,267
You should eat more so as to be strong!

869
00:55:12,354 --> 00:55:13,355
Finish it

870
00:55:13,647 --> 00:55:14,648
No, I am full

871
00:55:14,731 --> 00:55:17,067
You should take all the food

872
00:55:18,026 --> 00:55:20,070
OK, just forget it, let's go home

873
00:55:21,405 --> 00:55:24,658
Come on, eat them all

874
00:55:27,703 --> 00:55:28,204
Little kid!

875
00:55:28,287 --> 00:55:29,038
What?

876
00:55:29,162 --> 00:55:29,829
May I…

877
00:55:29,913 --> 00:55:30,872
No

878
00:55:49,099 --> 00:55:55,188
Be merciful!

879
00:55:57,900 --> 00:56:02,822
Be merciful to me please

880
00:56:05,199 --> 00:56:07,410
My dad is dying!

881
00:56:09,620 --> 00:56:11,580
Beggar, do you want the broken charcoal?

882
00:56:11,663 --> 00:56:12,789
Thank you

883
00:56:13,707 --> 00:56:15,417
Can you give me some coins?

884
00:56:16,502 --> 00:56:18,212
It's you!

885
00:56:18,587 --> 00:56:19,421
No, you are mistaken

886
00:56:19,963 --> 00:56:21,423
Sister, it's him

887
00:56:21,715 --> 00:56:22,674
No, no

888
00:56:22,716 --> 00:56:24,593
Sister, he is So Chan

889
00:56:28,263 --> 00:56:29,139
Wait!

890
00:56:33,769 --> 00:56:35,729
Miss, who are you looking for?

891
00:56:38,148 --> 00:56:39,733
I am sorry, I made a mistake

892
00:56:40,192 --> 00:56:41,735
Tracy, take some dumplings out

893
00:56:42,110 --> 00:56:44,112
You are mistaken, he is not So Chan

894
00:56:45,697 --> 00:56:46,740
You are like my friend

895
00:56:47,658 --> 00:56:50,327
Come to get some dumplings if you get nothing to eat

896
00:56:51,245 --> 00:56:52,747
We always have surplus

897
00:56:54,498 --> 00:56:55,207
Dumplings

898
00:56:55,332 --> 00:56:56,291
Take it

899
00:57:00,003 --> 00:57:01,588
Thank you…

900
00:57:04,341 --> 00:57:05,092
Sister, he wouldn't be that poor

901
00:57:05,175 --> 00:57:07,928
if it were not for you

902
00:57:21,650 --> 00:57:23,694
Dad, what are you doing?

903
00:57:23,777 --> 00:57:26,280
I can't stand the hunger

904
00:57:26,363 --> 00:57:29,783
So I bit the dumpling of the kid

905
00:57:30,534 --> 00:57:32,119
I have a dumpling, take it back

906
00:57:32,202 --> 00:57:32,994
Could I pay you with another head

907
00:57:33,078 --> 00:57:35,163
if I chopped yours

908
00:57:37,583 --> 00:57:38,959
Are you the Scholar?

909
00:57:41,086 --> 00:57:43,255
Yes, are you the Scholar?

910
00:57:44,631 --> 00:57:45,340
I was nearly the Scholar

911
00:57:45,424 --> 00:57:47,009
He is the Scholar!

912
00:57:47,384 --> 00:57:48,844
We should give him face

913
00:57:48,927 --> 00:57:50,804
Thank you

914
00:57:50,888 --> 00:57:53,015
Hold it

915
00:57:55,184 --> 00:57:56,811
Are they going to treat me to

916
00:57:56,894 --> 00:57:59,230
some food?

917
00:58:02,941 --> 00:58:03,859
The dog's rice

918
00:58:04,776 --> 00:58:07,988
Sir, I will let your dad go if you eat the dog's rice now

919
00:58:13,076 --> 00:58:13,952
What's the matter?

920
00:58:14,745 --> 00:58:15,746
Come on

921
00:58:26,173 --> 00:58:27,758
Chan, don't eat that

922
00:58:27,841 --> 00:58:29,301
You can't face the others if you eat this

923
00:58:30,302 --> 00:58:32,137
Let's forget about me

924
00:58:32,471 --> 00:58:34,932
Sir, I was a general in Canton

925
00:58:36,850 --> 00:58:37,517
So what?

926
00:58:37,601 --> 00:58:38,519
Stop fighting

927
00:58:38,602 --> 00:58:39,978
Stand properly

928
00:58:47,361 --> 00:58:49,113
The Scholar eats the dog's food

929
00:58:50,781 --> 00:58:51,865
It's quite delicious

930
00:58:54,743 --> 00:58:57,037
Try some. Come on

931
00:59:00,916 --> 00:59:03,460
It's delicious, isn't it?

932
00:59:08,048 --> 00:59:09,341
Dad, look!

933
00:59:10,175 --> 00:59:11,426
There is a slice of meat here

934
00:59:11,510 --> 00:59:13,429
It's pork chop!

935
00:59:23,605 --> 00:59:25,232
They are as hungry as dogs!

936
00:59:25,315 --> 00:59:27,150
Enjoy the dog food!

937
00:59:29,361 --> 00:59:31,947
Hurry, finish it

938
00:59:33,198 --> 00:59:34,366
That's too delicious!

939
00:59:34,741 --> 00:59:36,743
I want to save it for midnight snack

940
00:59:36,827 --> 00:59:37,745
It's very clever of you!

941
00:59:38,078 --> 00:59:39,913
You deserve to be beggars

942
00:59:42,457 --> 00:59:43,917
The Scholar is eating dog food

943
00:59:44,084 --> 00:59:45,210
Come on, let's go and eat the man's food

944
00:59:51,675 --> 00:59:52,801
Uncle So!

945
00:59:57,681 --> 00:59:58,974
You are…

946
00:59:59,474 --> 01:00:01,059
My dad was the Master of the Beggars' Association

947
01:00:01,435 --> 01:00:03,646
Why don't you join our Beggars' Association?

948
01:00:04,104 --> 01:00:05,230
Uncle Mok, isn't it a good idea?

949
01:00:05,314 --> 01:00:06,148
Good

950
01:00:06,231 --> 01:00:07,899
Isn't it the association for beggars?

951
01:00:07,941 --> 01:00:08,817
Yes!

952
01:00:08,901 --> 01:00:10,778
That's right, we are being beggars

953
01:00:10,861 --> 01:00:12,905
It's wise to join the Beggars' Association so as to be taken care of

954
01:00:12,946 --> 01:00:15,323
Chan… where is that fool going?

955
01:00:15,407 --> 01:00:16,575
Where is Chan?

956
01:00:16,658 --> 01:00:17,951
OK, we will join you!

957
01:00:18,035 --> 01:00:20,371
Chan… Chan…

958
01:00:32,549 --> 01:00:35,177
Yushang, good year!

959
01:00:35,260 --> 01:00:37,345
Uncle Mok, happy new year!

960
01:00:37,429 --> 01:00:38,680
This is for you

961
01:00:39,097 --> 01:00:40,390
Thank you

962
01:00:42,476 --> 01:00:43,727
One cloth is for you

963
01:00:43,810 --> 01:00:44,894
and the other is for Chan

964
01:00:45,896 --> 01:00:47,356
Thank you. Put it down first

965
01:00:49,066 --> 01:00:49,858
Do you have any coins?

966
01:00:49,942 --> 01:00:50,776
Yes!

967
01:00:50,859 --> 01:00:51,943
Give them to me, come on

968
01:00:51,985 --> 01:00:52,944
What for?

969
01:00:52,986 --> 01:00:54,863
It's new year,

970
01:00:54,947 --> 01:00:56,699
you should receive a red packet

971
01:00:56,782 --> 01:00:58,325
Come on, happy new year

972
01:00:58,951 --> 01:00:59,660
Good year!

973
01:00:59,743 --> 01:01:00,953
Wish you everlasting beauty

974
01:01:00,994 --> 01:01:01,745
Thank you…

975
01:01:01,828 --> 01:01:02,829
Uncle Mok, we don't need to give red packets to each other

976
01:01:02,913 --> 01:01:03,997
How about Chan

977
01:01:04,331 --> 01:01:08,710
Chan?

978
01:01:08,877 --> 01:01:10,003
He is still sleeping

979
01:01:10,087 --> 01:01:12,214
Don't wake him up

980
01:01:13,048 --> 01:01:14,508
I will cook you some New Year cake

981
01:01:15,133 --> 01:01:17,927
Let me help you

982
01:01:19,471 --> 01:01:21,181
How can he sleep on the first day of the year?

983
01:01:22,558 --> 01:01:24,393
He is useless

984
01:01:27,396 --> 01:01:28,355
Are you all here?

985
01:01:29,273 --> 01:01:32,026
To fight against Chiu, we need a union of the Beggars' Association

986
01:01:33,402 --> 01:01:35,738
So we must choose a new master to be in charge of the association

987
01:01:37,030 --> 01:01:38,949
Yushang…

988
01:01:40,117 --> 01:01:41,952
To defeat the Lotus Position of the three seniors

989
01:01:42,035 --> 01:01:43,036
You should try your best

990
01:01:43,871 --> 01:01:46,749
Uncle, I don't have faith that I can defeat them

991
01:01:47,207 --> 01:01:49,000
Judging from my kung-fu now,

992
01:01:49,084 --> 01:01:51,587
how can I defeat them and become the new master?

993
01:01:53,380 --> 01:01:56,592
Take this Taiwanese pill, after this, your power will be improved

994
01:01:57,342 --> 01:02:00,262
No, this is the only medicine to cure your inner injury

995
01:02:00,345 --> 01:02:01,429
How can I take this?

996
01:02:01,847 --> 01:02:03,015
Don't worry,

997
01:02:03,056 --> 01:02:05,267
you can ask my son to fight for you

998
01:02:05,350 --> 01:02:07,936
He was a Scholar of Martial Arts before…

999
01:02:08,020 --> 01:02:09,104
Before…

1000
01:02:09,188 --> 01:02:10,731
Look at him, he is so lazy,

1001
01:02:10,814 --> 01:02:12,816
he only knows how to sleep

1002
01:02:13,192 --> 01:02:15,027
He is not even qualified to be a beggar!

1003
01:02:15,110 --> 01:02:16,612
Don't be that frank, can you?

1004
01:02:18,071 --> 01:02:19,447
Don't shout that loudly, OK?

1005
01:02:28,332 --> 01:02:32,837
Chan, no matter how they despise you,

1006
01:02:34,421 --> 01:02:36,089
I have faith in you

1007
01:02:37,216 --> 01:02:39,093
Although you lost your power

1008
01:02:39,635 --> 01:02:41,178
With your background,

1009
01:02:41,553 --> 01:02:43,055
if only you try hard,

1010
01:02:43,096 --> 01:02:45,140
you can achieve something

1011
01:02:45,557 --> 01:02:47,559
But I am now powerless, I don't want to fight again

1012
01:02:47,643 --> 01:02:48,894
You have power!

1013
01:02:48,977 --> 01:02:49,936
Come on, beat me

1014
01:02:54,024 --> 01:02:55,275
See, that was powerful

1015
01:02:55,651 --> 01:02:57,278
Well, being a person…

1016
01:02:57,819 --> 01:02:59,404
Forget it, don't waste time

1017
01:02:59,488 --> 01:03:01,031
Why don't you let me sleep?

1018
01:03:07,204 --> 01:03:07,955
Why did you lock the door?

1019
01:03:08,038 --> 01:03:09,164
Enjoy sleeping

1020
01:03:24,054 --> 01:03:24,846
Son,

1021
01:03:24,930 --> 01:03:27,641
I tried very hard to get this for you

1022
01:03:28,058 --> 01:03:31,144
Try hard to practise, be good

1023
01:03:54,209 --> 01:03:55,293
Why do you go up?

1024
01:03:56,420 --> 01:03:58,088
Even if you want me to practise Kung Fu,

1025
01:03:58,172 --> 01:04:00,508
you should give me a waddy first

1026
01:04:02,176 --> 01:04:03,803
I am sorry, catch it

1027
01:04:12,603 --> 01:04:15,272
Before being appointed to an important task,

1028
01:04:15,355 --> 01:04:20,485
God will give you severe training for your soul and flesh.

1029
01:04:27,576 --> 01:04:30,245
Did you write it?

1030
01:04:31,205 --> 01:04:36,085
It's ugly, it's right to wipe it away

1031
01:04:38,086 --> 01:04:40,130
Hey, beggar?

1032
01:04:40,506 --> 01:04:41,132
Yes

1033
01:04:41,215 --> 01:04:42,091
Me too

1034
01:04:42,674 --> 01:04:43,675
Congratulations

1035
01:04:44,384 --> 01:04:46,177
Is there anything to eat?

1036
01:04:46,261 --> 01:04:47,262
No

1037
01:04:47,346 --> 01:04:48,848
Luckily, I have

1038
01:04:54,645 --> 01:04:57,481
See your look,

1039
01:04:57,564 --> 01:04:58,690
it's a waste for you not to beg

1040
01:04:59,316 --> 01:05:00,400
None of your damn business

1041
01:05:01,610 --> 01:05:02,903
You are too lazy to be a beggar!

1042
01:05:02,986 --> 01:05:04,529
Your fellows despise you

1043
01:05:07,115 --> 01:05:08,825
I was always respected by others

1044
01:05:09,284 --> 01:05:10,577
But now, I am despised

1045
01:05:11,245 --> 01:05:12,496
Dislike from you,

1046
01:05:12,579 --> 01:05:14,581
no one respected me before

1047
01:05:14,998 --> 01:05:18,084
Listen to me. Don't go!

1048
01:05:18,752 --> 01:05:23,006
I remembered once in Canton

1049
01:05:23,090 --> 01:05:26,051
A fool paid my living, including hooking

1050
01:05:26,134 --> 01:05:27,677
What a weird man

1051
01:05:30,556 --> 01:05:32,099
Kid, I remembered you

1052
01:05:32,808 --> 01:05:34,768
Me too

1053
01:05:34,852 --> 01:05:35,978
Hey, hurry up

1054
01:05:36,061 --> 01:05:37,521
Repay my money, I am in urgent need

1055
01:05:37,646 --> 01:05:38,730
If I had money,

1056
01:05:38,814 --> 01:05:41,191
I wouldn't be a beggar!

1057
01:05:45,279 --> 01:05:47,907
But, don't worry, you were my benefactor,

1058
01:05:47,990 --> 01:05:49,200
I will repay you one day

1059
01:05:51,034 --> 01:05:52,536
Thank you very much

1060
01:05:53,745 --> 01:05:55,080
But, you can't buy back what you lost

1061
01:05:55,372 --> 01:05:57,040
even if you have money again

1062
01:05:58,709 --> 01:05:59,585
What did I lose?

1063
01:05:59,668 --> 01:06:02,087
Pride and faith

1064
01:06:02,171 --> 01:06:03,881
And your woman too

1065
01:06:06,466 --> 01:06:07,467
What are you?

1066
01:06:07,843 --> 01:06:11,805
I am Hung Yat-sun, nicknamed Old Bag Sun

1067
01:06:11,889 --> 01:06:15,351
I am the most senior one among the beggars

1068
01:06:15,434 --> 01:06:16,685
It's good to be a beggar

1069
01:06:17,144 --> 01:06:18,771
You can do everything you want

1070
01:06:18,854 --> 01:06:20,064
You can do the same

1071
01:06:20,147 --> 01:06:22,816
Tell me, what do you want? I will make your wish come true

1072
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:24,276
I want to be human again

1073
01:06:24,359 --> 01:06:26,069
Don't you think you are not human-like?

1074
01:06:27,613 --> 01:06:28,948
Not at all

1075
01:06:29,031 --> 01:06:31,492
So you have to be a beggar now

1076
01:06:33,952 --> 01:06:36,580
Very good! Very good!

1077
01:06:37,164 --> 01:06:40,459
But I won't cheat you, from your head to toes

1078
01:06:40,542 --> 01:06:42,794
Every part of you is beggar-like

1079
01:06:44,338 --> 01:06:45,005
So what?

1080
01:06:45,088 --> 01:06:47,465
That means, you will be a beggar for your life

1081
01:06:50,385 --> 01:06:52,846
I don't want to talk to you, I want to sleep first

1082
01:06:53,347 --> 01:06:55,349
Don't go, you can achieve in your profession

1083
01:06:55,474 --> 01:06:56,558
From my judgement,

1084
01:06:56,642 --> 01:06:58,310
you will be the king of beggars

1085
01:06:58,852 --> 01:07:01,271
King of beggars, what does that mean?

1086
01:07:03,106 --> 01:07:04,149
That is a beggar

1087
01:07:08,320 --> 01:07:10,280
I don't care who you are, I just want to stop the conversation

1088
01:07:10,364 --> 01:07:12,324
Please step aside, don't stop me from sleeping

1089
01:07:13,116 --> 01:07:14,117
Damn you!

1090
01:07:14,243 --> 01:07:16,454
No… I just want to sleep with you

1091
01:07:17,704 --> 01:07:18,538
Idiot!

1092
01:07:22,626 --> 01:07:25,254
Kid, see you in the dream

1093
01:07:36,515 --> 01:07:38,934
Before the Buddha, the disciples return to your positions

1094
01:07:40,394 --> 01:07:43,647
To suppress the dragon and tiger

1095
01:07:50,654 --> 01:07:53,031
So Chan, you enjoyed the prosperity of the world

1096
01:07:53,115 --> 01:07:54,908
And you tasted the bitter fruit of the world too

1097
01:07:55,325 --> 01:07:56,618
Now you regret it

1098
01:07:56,994 --> 01:07:59,705
On behalf of Master Hung

1099
01:07:59,788 --> 01:08:01,373
I appoint you to be the "Sleeping Disciple"

1100
01:08:01,415 --> 01:08:05,294
Now, I will teach you the "Sleeping Disciple's Fist"!

1101
01:08:05,377 --> 01:08:07,838
Hope you can make good use of it. Come on

1102
01:08:13,218 --> 01:08:17,597
Senior…

1103
01:08:22,728 --> 01:08:25,356
The bitter past

1104
01:08:30,277 --> 01:08:33,822
Long life to you…

1105
01:08:36,450 --> 01:08:38,994
Here comes the White Goat

1106
01:08:39,661 --> 01:08:43,790
My mother, give me power

1107
01:08:44,416 --> 01:08:45,459
To save the people!

1108
01:09:06,939 --> 01:09:08,649
Tomorrow the Emperor will go hunting

1109
01:09:09,066 --> 01:09:11,944
I will send him a pretty girl, so as to get close to him

1110
01:09:13,904 --> 01:09:17,074
Yuen Ling, you should seduce him tomorrow

1111
01:09:17,574 --> 01:09:18,450
Yes

1112
01:09:19,952 --> 01:09:21,370
If we can kill the Emperor,

1113
01:09:21,912 --> 01:09:23,288
I can take over his reign

1114
01:09:23,997 --> 01:09:26,500
I will give you a share of wealth!

1115
01:09:31,547 --> 01:09:35,009
Long life to you

1116
01:09:35,759 --> 01:09:36,468
Senior!

1117
01:09:36,552 --> 01:09:37,720
Let's go back now

1118
01:10:09,751 --> 01:10:10,377
Senior!

1119
01:10:10,460 --> 01:10:11,127
Let's go!

1120
01:10:24,266 --> 01:10:25,100
Senior!

1121
01:11:04,223 --> 01:11:04,932
Let's chase them

1122
01:11:05,015 --> 01:11:08,227
Stop The Emperor is setting off soon

1123
01:11:09,770 --> 01:11:10,896
You killed a woman…

1124
01:11:11,230 --> 01:11:12,398
You should replace her as a gift to the Emperor!

1125
01:11:18,779 --> 01:11:20,990
No one dares come up to fight for the leadership?

1126
01:11:21,573 --> 01:11:23,784
Ask Mok to give us the "Dog Hitting Waddy"!

1127
01:11:25,869 --> 01:11:29,748
Ask that old bag to hand us the waddy

1128
01:11:29,915 --> 01:11:33,043
Where have they been?

1129
01:11:33,627 --> 01:11:34,753
I don't know,

1130
01:11:35,462 --> 01:11:37,589
I saw them chat,

1131
01:11:37,631 --> 01:11:38,674
then they went away

1132
01:11:41,426 --> 01:11:42,594
Is there any affair between them?

1133
01:11:54,398 --> 01:11:55,733
Now, we are going to choose the new leader

1134
01:12:02,573 --> 01:12:03,532
Uncle Mok…

1135
01:12:03,615 --> 01:12:04,533
I am scared,

1136
01:12:04,616 --> 01:12:05,325
I think you won't come back

1137
01:12:05,450 --> 01:12:06,534
How is it? Where is my sister?

1138
01:12:07,661 --> 01:12:09,204
Your sister is caught by Chiu

1139
01:12:09,872 --> 01:12:11,832
We need to find someone to compete for the leadership

1140
01:12:18,130 --> 01:12:19,590
Who should go?

1141
01:12:34,188 --> 01:12:34,772
I'll do it

1142
01:12:34,855 --> 01:12:35,647
Uncle Mok

1143
01:12:35,731 --> 01:12:37,233
Why don't you let me try?

1144
01:13:14,895 --> 01:13:15,854
Chan,

1145
01:13:17,773 --> 01:13:19,692
you are not qualified, come down

1146
01:13:21,276 --> 01:13:24,154
Since you don't have a good candidate, I'll give you some advantage

1147
01:13:24,696 --> 01:13:26,573
Chan, it's not a game

1148
01:13:26,990 --> 01:13:28,742
You will be killed, come down

1149
01:13:29,159 --> 01:13:31,828
It doesn't matter, I have forgotten my life already

1150
01:13:32,246 --> 01:13:33,289
Bullshit, throw him to his death

1151
01:13:43,131 --> 01:13:44,758
Well, I will make your wish come true

1152
01:14:13,704 --> 01:14:14,246
What is he doing?

1153
01:14:14,329 --> 01:14:15,038
Sleeping

1154
01:14:29,887 --> 01:14:31,305
Isn't this stance…

1155
01:14:32,347 --> 01:14:34,349
Uncle Sun's "Sleeping Disciple's Fists"?

1156
01:14:35,350 --> 01:14:36,226
Set the position!

1157
01:14:52,576 --> 01:14:53,535
Is it dawn?

1158
01:15:52,219 --> 01:15:53,429
I am sorry!

1159
01:15:53,887 --> 01:15:54,805
I won

1160
01:15:54,888 --> 01:15:56,098
What is the use of defeating us?

1161
01:15:56,181 --> 01:15:57,057
You don't know how to use the "Dog Hitting Waddy".

1162
01:15:58,058 --> 01:15:59,101
You are not qualified to be our leader

1163
01:16:02,646 --> 01:16:04,064
"Dog Hitting Waddy"?

1164
01:16:08,610 --> 01:16:09,736
It's for hitting dogs

1165
01:16:11,780 --> 01:16:13,115
I do know how to use this waddy!

1166
01:16:13,615 --> 01:16:14,616
But it's different from the standard stances!

1167
01:16:14,992 --> 01:16:15,618
It's quite powerful!

1168
01:16:20,539 --> 01:16:21,957
He broke the waddy!

1169
01:16:23,917 --> 01:16:26,169
He broke the treasure of our Association, let's kill him!

1170
01:16:40,267 --> 01:16:42,269
I am Master Hung, who dares go against me?

1171
01:16:43,729 --> 01:16:45,314
I set the rules of the association

1172
01:16:45,397 --> 01:16:48,233
Any student who defeats the Lotus Position

1173
01:16:48,317 --> 01:16:50,236
could be the leader

1174
01:16:50,861 --> 01:16:52,404
Have you all forgotten?

1175
01:16:53,030 --> 01:16:55,324
We became the biggest association

1176
01:16:55,407 --> 01:16:57,117
because of being united

1177
01:16:57,784 --> 01:16:59,995
I left you the "Dog Hitting Waddy",

1178
01:17:00,078 --> 01:17:02,372
is just for remembrance

1179
01:17:02,789 --> 01:17:05,041
The waddy is meaningless

1180
01:17:05,125 --> 01:17:07,336
But you fools take this as treasure

1181
01:17:07,419 --> 01:17:10,589
And fight among yourselves for this damn waddy!

1182
01:17:10,672 --> 01:17:13,341
In these five years, you have had no leader. Don't you feel ashamed?

1183
01:17:13,926 --> 01:17:15,219
So Chan broke the waddy,

1184
01:17:15,302 --> 01:17:16,428
so you won't fight for this anymore

1185
01:17:16,512 --> 01:17:17,763
He is correct to do so

1186
01:17:18,055 --> 01:17:19,431
This youngster is so junior,

1187
01:17:19,515 --> 01:17:20,975
but he is a genius, a smartass

1188
01:17:21,058 --> 01:17:23,269
He is being taught by my disciple Hung Yat Sun

1189
01:17:23,352 --> 01:17:24,979
Whoever doesn't respect him is going against me too

1190
01:17:26,855 --> 01:17:27,939
You should respect him,

1191
01:17:28,023 --> 01:17:29,316
your new leader, and you should love him,

1192
01:17:29,399 --> 01:17:32,944
wholeheartedly, care for him, maybe treat him to dinner

1193
01:17:32,986 --> 01:17:34,196
Then, although I am in heaven,

1194
01:17:34,279 --> 01:17:38,200
I will bless all of you, all the best

1195
01:17:40,410 --> 01:17:41,912
Isn't it true?

1196
01:17:43,163 --> 01:17:44,998
You'd better trust it

1197
01:17:45,415 --> 01:17:47,626
Master Hung's soul talked to us,

1198
01:17:47,709 --> 01:17:49,544
we are blessed

1199
01:17:50,629 --> 01:17:53,006
They are easily cheated, I am really a genius!

1200
01:17:53,924 --> 01:17:55,134
We'll have a better life

1201
01:17:57,469 --> 01:17:59,346
What happened?

1202
01:18:01,181 --> 01:18:02,432
Let's greet the new Master

1203
01:18:05,811 --> 01:18:10,274
You should have faith, you won, bravo…

1204
01:18:12,109 --> 01:18:14,278
Uncle Mok, my son is really great!

1205
01:18:16,822 --> 01:18:18,532
I can't believe you have learnt the "Sleeping Disciple's Fists"?!

1206
01:18:20,742 --> 01:18:23,245
From now on, you are our new leader

1207
01:18:24,454 --> 01:18:26,331
This is the book of "Dragon Suppressing Stances"

1208
01:18:26,415 --> 01:18:28,042
And, I will give you the Taiwan Pill

1209
01:18:29,168 --> 01:18:31,128
Hope you will be a good leader

1210
01:18:32,421 --> 01:18:34,256
I just want to save Yushang as soon as possible

1211
01:18:36,425 --> 01:18:38,218
Yushang didn't make a wrong choice

1212
01:18:39,136 --> 01:18:43,474
Bravo! Bravo!

1213
01:18:48,061 --> 01:18:51,314
Uncle Mok, how are you?

1214
01:18:52,399 --> 01:18:54,401
Uncle Mok!

1215
01:18:55,819 --> 01:19:00,073
Uncle Mok…

1216
01:19:49,373 --> 01:19:50,291
Do you understand everything

1217
01:19:50,374 --> 01:19:52,793
written in this book?

1218
01:19:52,876 --> 01:19:54,252
Don't think that I am so foolish

1219
01:19:54,753 --> 01:19:56,129
After getting the help of Taiwan Pill

1220
01:19:56,213 --> 01:19:59,133
My initial power is increased

1221
01:19:59,925 --> 01:20:02,511
I can control the first 17 stances

1222
01:20:02,928 --> 01:20:05,597
But the last stance,

1223
01:20:05,681 --> 01:20:07,057
there is no picture or description of it

1224
01:20:07,391 --> 01:20:08,642
I can't understand at all

1225
01:20:09,142 --> 01:20:12,145
But Uncle Mok is dead, what'll we do now?

1226
01:20:12,688 --> 01:20:13,689
Just go ahead

1227
01:20:13,772 --> 01:20:15,899
No matter how, I have to save Yushang first

1228
01:21:27,763 --> 01:21:29,390
Check whether the camp is ready or not?

1229
01:21:29,473 --> 01:21:30,432
Yes!

1230
01:21:50,285 --> 01:21:51,244
Chiu,

1231
01:21:51,662 --> 01:21:54,206
why do you bring this woman here?

1232
01:21:54,289 --> 01:21:55,624
I know the Emperor loves pretty women

1233
01:21:55,707 --> 01:21:58,084
So I want to send him this gift

1234
01:21:58,544 --> 01:21:59,795
And I want to meet him too

1235
01:22:00,212 --> 01:22:02,339
There is no order from the Emperor

1236
01:22:02,965 --> 01:22:05,176
Men, come and take this woman to the camp

1237
01:22:05,259 --> 01:22:06,385
Yes

1238
01:22:06,969 --> 01:22:07,845
Go!

1239
01:22:10,806 --> 01:22:13,684
Sir, you look great!

1240
01:22:15,143 --> 01:22:17,020
I think you should go back

1241
01:22:17,396 --> 01:22:18,564
to your own position

1242
01:22:19,231 --> 01:22:20,274
Yes

1243
01:22:36,206 --> 01:22:37,040
Your Majesty,

1244
01:22:37,124 --> 01:22:39,126
Officer Chiu brings this woman to you

1245
01:22:40,085 --> 01:22:40,877
Woman?

1246
01:22:43,297 --> 01:22:44,465
Chiu knows my hobby!

1247
01:22:45,382 --> 01:22:47,593
I want to take a bath first, bring her to me later

1248
01:22:47,676 --> 01:22:48,677
Yes

1249
01:23:11,491 --> 01:23:14,536
This bastard wants to see the Emperor,

1250
01:23:15,746 --> 01:23:18,832
if I let him see His Majesty often, my post will be taken away

1251
01:23:23,962 --> 01:23:24,838
Men

1252
01:23:26,548 --> 01:23:27,382
Sir

1253
01:23:27,466 --> 01:23:28,634
Check what has happened

1254
01:23:28,717 --> 01:23:29,718
Yes

1255
01:23:33,138 --> 01:23:35,932
Sir, there are many people coming from the forest

1256
01:23:36,350 --> 01:23:37,476
Who are they?

1257
01:23:38,268 --> 01:23:39,269
I don't know!

1258
01:23:40,103 --> 01:23:40,854
Release the alarm smoke

1259
01:23:40,938 --> 01:23:41,689
Be alert

1260
01:23:41,772 --> 01:23:42,690
Yes

1261
01:23:52,115 --> 01:23:53,700
There is smoke ahead, let's get armed

1262
01:23:53,784 --> 01:23:54,618
Yes

1263
01:24:56,555 --> 01:24:57,556
Damn you beggars

1264
01:25:02,436 --> 01:25:04,355
So Chan, what are you doing?

1265
01:25:05,314 --> 01:25:08,484
Nothing, I just want to beg for money

1266
01:25:09,026 --> 01:25:11,278
Shit, do you want to get killed?

1267
01:25:11,653 --> 01:25:12,821
It's you who will be killed

1268
01:25:14,364 --> 01:25:15,740
Chiu wants to raise a rebel,

1269
01:25:15,824 --> 01:25:17,326
he is going to assassinate the king

1270
01:25:17,409 --> 01:25:18,619
You fathead!

1271
01:25:19,828 --> 01:25:21,163
Who do you think you are?

1272
01:25:21,455 --> 01:25:23,874
How dare you frame the courtier?

1273
01:25:24,416 --> 01:25:26,460
I will kill you if you step forward

1274
01:25:31,006 --> 01:25:33,467
Chan, how can we fight with them?

1275
01:25:33,550 --> 01:25:34,634
- Senior    - Yes

1276
01:25:35,469 --> 01:25:36,512
Where are the rest of our men?

1277
01:25:36,595 --> 01:25:37,930
They are coming

1278
01:25:39,765 --> 01:25:40,891
We have no time,

1279
01:25:40,974 --> 01:25:42,517
you stay here to wait for the others

1280
01:25:42,601 --> 01:25:43,310
I will go first

1281
01:25:43,435 --> 01:25:44,019
I will follow

1282
01:25:44,102 --> 01:25:44,936
Be serious

1283
01:25:45,020 --> 01:25:46,480
Master, don't worry

1284
01:25:47,231 --> 01:25:48,733
Am I going to die?

1285
01:25:48,815 --> 01:25:50,483
Say something lucky, OK?

1286
01:25:50,859 --> 01:25:55,447
Sure! Happy birthday to you…

1287
01:25:55,489 --> 01:25:58,492
Happy birthday to you…

1288
01:25:58,909 --> 01:26:00,244
Happy birthday to you…

1289
01:26:00,327 --> 01:26:01,286
That's enough

1290
01:26:01,411 --> 01:26:02,370
I haven't finished

1291
01:26:02,454 --> 01:26:03,413
Go on after I've left

1292
01:26:03,497 --> 01:26:04,540
Sure

1293
01:26:16,552 --> 01:26:18,554
There is smoke ahead, someone must have alarmed them

1294
01:26:21,557 --> 01:26:22,391
Get the Kirin Smokes ready

1295
01:26:22,474 --> 01:26:22,975
Yes

1296
01:26:23,058 --> 01:26:24,017
Attack the main camp

1297
01:27:24,995 --> 01:27:28,207
Rebel! Help!

1298
01:27:28,999 --> 01:27:29,833
They should be killed

1299
01:27:29,958 --> 01:27:31,835
The one who didn't kill you should be killed

1300
01:27:33,128 --> 01:27:35,339
Shit, the poisoned smoke

1301
01:27:35,422 --> 01:27:36,632
is blowing toward the Royal camp

1302
01:27:42,804 --> 01:27:44,472
No, the wind direction changed

1303
01:27:45,224 --> 01:27:46,767
Yes, wait for me

1304
01:27:48,977 --> 01:27:51,104
If the beggars don't retreat now, we will kill without mercy

1305
01:28:10,207 --> 01:28:11,208
Have a look

1306
01:28:15,587 --> 01:28:16,630
The Kirin Smokes of the Tin Li Sect

1307
01:28:27,683 --> 01:28:29,977
Be calm, urine is the antidote to the poison

1308
01:28:31,019 --> 01:28:33,271
Come and piss

1309
01:28:37,234 --> 01:28:38,861
How about me?

1310
01:28:39,528 --> 01:28:41,363
Don't worry, I can give you some urine

1311
01:28:41,446 --> 01:28:42,405
Come on, hold it

1312
01:28:48,829 --> 01:28:49,788
Rush in!

1313
01:28:59,173 --> 01:28:59,924
How is the situation?

1314
01:29:00,007 --> 01:29:02,009
Thanks to Your Majesty's luck, the wind direction changed

1315
01:29:02,134 --> 01:29:03,594
The smoke is going in the other direction

1316
01:29:03,677 --> 01:29:05,179
How about our armies?

1317
01:29:05,262 --> 01:29:06,972
They are all dead

1318
01:29:08,056 --> 01:29:08,932
Bring me the sword

1319
01:29:09,016 --> 01:29:09,975
Don't… don't!

1320
01:29:10,100 --> 01:29:11,643
Get lost! Get lost!

1321
01:29:11,685 --> 01:29:13,729
Your Majesty, it's dangerous, don't go!

1322
01:29:13,812 --> 01:29:16,690
Get lost! Don't you want to wait for death? Get lost!

1323
01:29:18,108 --> 01:29:19,151
You are ordered to get away

1324
01:29:19,818 --> 01:29:22,237
You can't go!

1325
01:30:00,651 --> 01:30:01,819
Protect me

1326
01:30:26,885 --> 01:30:27,761
Chan?

1327
01:30:29,930 --> 01:30:30,722
Yushang

1328
01:30:30,806 --> 01:30:32,099
How did you get here?

1329
01:30:32,724 --> 01:30:34,643
It's a long story

1330
01:30:34,726 --> 01:30:36,603
We left our base last night

1331
01:30:36,728 --> 01:30:37,854
We reached the Great Wall

1332
01:30:37,938 --> 01:30:40,190
this morning

1333
01:30:40,274 --> 01:30:42,276
We stayed one hour for lunch

1334
01:30:42,359 --> 01:30:43,735
I pissed once

1335
01:30:43,819 --> 01:30:44,653
Really?

1336
01:30:44,736 --> 01:30:45,987
Yes, then I wanted to eat a sweet potato

1337
01:30:46,113 --> 01:30:47,072
But only dumplings were left

1338
01:30:47,155 --> 01:30:49,532
You know, I don't like eating dumplings

1339
01:30:50,701 --> 01:30:52,703
I am late to save you, please forgive me

1340
01:30:55,122 --> 01:30:55,873
To protect the Emperor

1341
01:30:56,373 --> 01:30:57,332
Yes

1342
01:31:00,669 --> 01:31:01,336
You traitor!

1343
01:31:01,420 --> 01:31:02,129
Catch him

1344
01:31:08,594 --> 01:31:09,386
Your Majesty

1345
01:31:12,848 --> 01:31:14,641
You bastard, give your kingdom to me

1346
01:31:14,725 --> 01:31:15,851
Are you telling him?

1347
01:31:18,979 --> 01:31:19,771
It's you

1348
01:31:19,813 --> 01:31:21,440
Yes, I am Beggar So

1349
01:31:22,232 --> 01:31:25,193
Why don't you sleep in your hut?

1350
01:31:25,652 --> 01:31:27,821
Well, I am a little bit sleepy

1351
01:32:05,108 --> 01:32:05,900
"Sleeping Disciple"?

1352
01:32:06,443 --> 01:32:10,364
Yes. Look at you, you are like a beggar too

1353
01:32:10,447 --> 01:32:11,949
Are you interested to join us?

1354
01:32:13,867 --> 01:32:15,994
I couldn't have guessed you would recover!

1355
01:32:16,453 --> 01:32:18,163
Yes, it's all because of you

1356
01:32:22,709 --> 01:32:24,711
Did you use all your force? I didn't

1357
01:32:43,355 --> 01:32:46,483
Fool, only the "Dragon Suppressing Stances" scare me

1358
01:32:46,525 --> 01:32:48,277
I don't give a damn about any other stances

1359
01:33:00,831 --> 01:33:02,666
"Dragon Suppress Stances"

1360
01:33:05,335 --> 01:33:06,461
"Dragon in the sky"

1361
01:33:08,088 --> 01:33:08,797
"Dragon swings its tail"

1362
01:33:09,089 --> 01:33:09,798
"Dragon steals the heart"

1363
01:33:09,882 --> 01:33:10,674
Dragon swims, dragon in the field,

1364
01:33:10,841 --> 01:33:11,884
dragon dances…

1365
01:33:11,925 --> 01:33:12,884
Dragon's descendant,

1366
01:33:12,968 --> 01:33:14,011
dragon's wish…

1367
01:33:14,094 --> 01:33:15,345
Dragon's spirit, dragon's mate

1368
01:33:15,429 --> 01:33:16,805
Finished

1369
01:33:51,298 --> 01:33:53,801
You can't finish the last stance,

1370
01:33:53,884 --> 01:33:54,927
you can defeat me

1371
01:33:55,135 --> 01:33:56,136
after learning the 18th stance

1372
01:33:56,261 --> 01:33:57,512
But you have no chance

1373
01:34:05,854 --> 01:34:06,688
Chan!

1374
01:34:21,245 --> 01:34:23,497
I've got it! Just mix the 17 stances,

1375
01:34:23,580 --> 01:34:24,539
Then it's the 18th stance

1376
01:34:25,207 --> 01:34:26,834
I am too smart!

1377
01:34:56,864 --> 01:34:59,200
The 18th stance, "It's a regret to kill the Dragon"!

1378
01:35:29,313 --> 01:35:31,190
Chan, are you alright?

1379
01:35:31,607 --> 01:35:33,109
See, don't you think I am alright?

1380
01:35:34,026 --> 01:35:35,152
Your pose is really smart

1381
01:35:35,235 --> 01:35:37,028
But your look is awful!

1382
01:35:37,070 --> 01:35:38,154
Idiot, I am fine

1383
01:35:38,238 --> 01:35:39,531
I can marry tonight

1384
01:35:52,503 --> 01:35:53,045
Sister!

1385
01:35:53,128 --> 01:35:54,004
Tracy!

1386
01:35:54,087 --> 01:35:54,963
Where is Chiu?

1387
01:35:56,048 --> 01:35:56,966
He is around

1388
01:35:57,216 --> 01:35:58,551
Around?

1389
01:35:58,967 --> 01:36:00,218
He became ashes

1390
01:36:01,094 --> 01:36:02,721
Damn it!

1391
01:36:02,804 --> 01:36:04,097
Master

1392
01:36:04,181 --> 01:36:06,016
Chiu's fellows have all been caught by us

1393
01:36:10,229 --> 01:36:11,313
Thank you, buddies

1394
01:36:15,484 --> 01:36:16,276
Yushang

1395
01:36:16,360 --> 01:36:18,028
We have an agreement, do you remember?

1396
01:36:19,404 --> 01:36:22,616
Yes, be the top of all

1397
01:36:22,699 --> 01:36:24,910
Invincible

1398
01:36:25,244 --> 01:36:26,954
But, I can't be the Scholar

1399
01:36:27,037 --> 01:36:29,957
But I don't like to be the Scholar at all

1400
01:36:30,290 --> 01:36:31,708
I love to be a beggar

1401
01:36:33,669 --> 01:36:34,920
You first, I will go after you

1402
01:36:48,517 --> 01:36:51,812
Seng-ko-lin-ch'in, you are really a fool

1403
01:36:51,895 --> 01:36:53,563
You bring a thief to harm me

1404
01:36:54,147 --> 01:36:55,899
Now, you are entitled to be a beggar

1405
01:36:56,400 --> 01:36:58,736
You have potential to be a beggar

1406
01:36:59,486 --> 01:37:00,654
Report duty in the temple tomorrow

1407
01:37:01,280 --> 01:37:02,698
If anyone bullies you, just tell them my name

1408
01:37:04,366 --> 01:37:06,535
Thank you, thank you master

1409
01:37:06,618 --> 01:37:09,454
So Chan, what do you want as reward?

1410
01:37:12,416 --> 01:37:13,500
Don't you have anything to tell me?

1411
01:37:18,088 --> 01:37:20,132
Nothing special, let's go

1412
01:37:22,968 --> 01:37:24,678
Mister So!

1413
01:37:24,761 --> 01:37:25,929
Put it down

1414
01:37:26,305 --> 01:37:27,348
Although you have saved me,

1415
01:37:27,431 --> 01:37:29,892
if you don't respect me, I will kill you

1416
01:37:30,809 --> 01:37:33,020
If so, you needn't squat to talk to me

1417
01:37:33,812 --> 01:37:36,440
Don't move, it'll attract their attention

1418
01:37:39,359 --> 01:37:40,944
Actually we have no relation,

1419
01:37:41,028 --> 01:37:42,696
we have nothing to chat about

1420
01:37:43,197 --> 01:37:44,657
You have billions of fellows

1421
01:37:44,740 --> 01:37:47,117
Your force makes me worry

1422
01:37:48,202 --> 01:37:50,246
The number of fellows doesn't depend on me,

1423
01:37:50,329 --> 01:37:51,413
but you

1424
01:37:51,496 --> 01:37:52,580
What?

1425
01:37:53,665 --> 01:37:56,293
If you are great, making the society peaceful and wealthy,

1426
01:37:56,668 --> 01:37:58,795
no one wishes to be a beggar, right?

1427
01:38:00,380 --> 01:38:02,090
It's reasonable

1428
01:38:02,174 --> 01:38:03,092
Be smart

1429
01:38:03,926 --> 01:38:04,927
But,

1430
01:38:05,552 --> 01:38:07,596
give me some face

1431
01:38:08,847 --> 01:38:09,681
Yes

1432
01:38:09,765 --> 01:38:12,184
Long life to Your Majesty

1433
01:38:12,226 --> 01:38:13,561
Get up

1434
01:38:19,691 --> 01:38:21,109
Pal, do you know me?

1435
01:38:21,610 --> 01:38:23,362
Of course! You beggar

1436
01:38:23,445 --> 01:38:25,155
You beg with your girl, you think I'll give you money out of mercy?

1437
01:38:25,239 --> 01:38:26,407
Yes, please give me money

1438
01:38:26,490 --> 01:38:28,659
No mercy, go away

1439
01:38:28,742 --> 01:38:29,743
No, you should pay me

1440
01:38:30,244 --> 01:38:31,537
It's a must, pal

1441
01:38:32,371 --> 01:38:34,832
A must? Kidding?

1442
01:38:35,290 --> 01:38:37,501
It's true, be quick

1443
01:38:37,584 --> 01:38:38,585
It's bad luck to meet you

1444
01:38:39,044 --> 01:38:40,003
Stop

1445
01:38:40,087 --> 01:38:40,921
What?

1446
01:38:41,004 --> 01:38:44,049
See my family? Give more

1447
01:38:44,132 --> 01:38:45,216
How much?

1448
01:38:45,259 --> 01:38:46,677
Not less than a thousand, got me?

1449
01:38:51,348 --> 01:38:52,891
Say thank you now

1450
01:38:52,975 --> 01:38:55,811
Thank you, uncle
