1
00:01:43,312 --> 00:01:44,313
Young master, we are ready

2
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:26,808
What's a hard job for you, young master

3
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:27,809
The towel, young master

4
00:02:37,151 --> 00:02:38,652
What did he write?

5
00:02:38,735 --> 00:02:39,736
His name!

6
00:02:40,111 --> 00:02:43,823
Great! Young master knows how to write his name!

7
00:02:43,865 --> 00:02:44,949
Yes!

8
00:02:45,073 --> 00:02:46,241
Damn!

9
00:02:51,622 --> 00:02:52,455
Nice calligraphy

10
00:02:53,873 --> 00:02:54,791
Get lost

11
00:02:56,792 --> 00:03:01,296
Nice calligraphy! So Cha Ha Yee Chan!

12
00:03:02,047 --> 00:03:03,215
It's reversed, Master

13
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:05,258
Chan Yee Ha Cha So

14
00:03:06,134 --> 00:03:08,969
Good boy, but, don't be proud! Got me?

15
00:03:11,222 --> 00:03:13,808
Dad, since the first emperor of the Ching Dynasty,

16
00:03:13,933 --> 00:03:15,642
our family

17
00:03:15,725 --> 00:03:17,518
has been illiterate

18
00:03:17,602 --> 00:03:20,730
But not, my son, that's your grandson,

19
00:03:20,813 --> 00:03:22,731
he knows how to write his name!

20
00:03:22,814 --> 00:03:25,900
Dad, it's very great!

21
00:03:26,401 --> 00:03:27,861
He knows writing now,

22
00:03:27,945 --> 00:03:29,821
he will be scholar one day

23
00:03:29,904 --> 00:03:31,155
Now, he knows how to write his name,

24
00:03:31,239 --> 00:03:33,199
he will have a son later

25
00:03:33,699 --> 00:03:36,075
Young master, you should try hard to learn

26
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,411
Chan, I think, we should mount it

27
00:03:38,495 --> 00:03:39,162
OK

28
00:03:39,246 --> 00:03:41,331
Professor, show it in some obvious places

29
00:03:41,414 --> 00:03:42,457
By the way, one minute,

30
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:45,293
why don't you carry it with traditional decoration in the street?

31
00:03:45,376 --> 00:03:45,960
What?

32
00:03:46,043 --> 00:03:46,877
Let's go!

33
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:49,296
Chan, come and sit…

34
00:03:49,922 --> 00:03:52,424
I am so pleased that you are that hard working and filial

35
00:03:53,091 --> 00:03:56,469
Listen to me, I am notorious of being a spendthrift

36
00:03:56,553 --> 00:03:59,055
My fortune is almost used up

37
00:03:59,137 --> 00:04:01,848
If I die one day,

38
00:04:02,266 --> 00:04:03,768
you should depend on yourself

39
00:04:03,851 --> 00:04:04,893
I used to depend on myself

40
00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:08,187
The cheques worth 100,000 taels! Don't be an extravagant spender

41
00:04:09,105 --> 00:04:10,898
Give me the imported hat

42
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:12,066
Where are you going? Chan!

43
00:04:12,858 --> 00:04:13,650
I am having a grand birthday party tonight

44
00:04:14,985 --> 00:04:15,777
How old are you?

45
00:04:15,861 --> 00:04:17,946
25 years old. Come earlier

46
00:04:18,572 --> 00:04:21,115
But you should dress up first

47
00:04:21,198 --> 00:04:22,866
You are like beggar!

48
00:04:23,367 --> 00:04:25,452
How can a beggar be that rich?! I do want to be a rich beggar!

49
00:04:28,705 --> 00:04:29,956
That fat-headed…

50
00:04:30,039 --> 00:04:31,040
Come over here

51
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:32,417
What's the matter?

52
00:04:32,917 --> 00:04:35,794
The invitation card of my son is great!

53
00:04:35,878 --> 00:04:38,422
If I hold a birthday party in future, I want a better invitation card!

54
00:04:58,063 --> 00:05:00,983
Your Majesty, what do you think about the Cantonese Opera?

55
00:05:02,401 --> 00:05:05,403
For sure, it can't compete with Peking Opera!

56
00:05:05,945 --> 00:05:08,197
But, I appreciate viewing this

57
00:05:10,407 --> 00:05:13,076
Money…

58
00:05:13,911 --> 00:05:16,705
Tips. Tips…

59
00:05:16,788 --> 00:05:18,038
Happy birthday to you, Mr So

60
00:05:18,122 --> 00:05:20,291
I am homeless and sick…

61
00:05:20,374 --> 00:05:23,919
I am poor, I am damn poor!

62
00:05:24,295 --> 00:05:25,170
Please give me some money

63
00:05:25,253 --> 00:05:26,171
Kidding? Damn you beggar!

64
00:05:26,254 --> 00:05:28,798
How can you beg here?

65
00:05:28,882 --> 00:05:30,050
Go to hell!

66
00:05:30,133 --> 00:05:30,925
Give him tips

67
00:05:31,009 --> 00:05:32,134
Yes, young master

68
00:05:32,801 --> 00:05:34,344
Are you kidding? How can you give him tips?

69
00:05:36,013 --> 00:05:36,889
A beggar is a man too

70
00:05:36,972 --> 00:05:38,432
Everyone can come here if he has money

71
00:05:38,516 --> 00:05:39,433
Your living,

72
00:05:39,516 --> 00:05:41,810
including the expenditure for hooking, I will pay for you!

73
00:05:41,893 --> 00:05:42,727
You pay it?

74
00:05:42,811 --> 00:05:43,729
So what?

75
00:05:44,145 --> 00:05:46,813
Nothing!

76
00:05:46,897 --> 00:05:48,273
Please follow me

77
00:05:48,357 --> 00:05:51,485
Come into my room…

78
00:05:51,568 --> 00:05:53,487
Mr So!

79
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:55,029
Hello…

80
00:05:55,112 --> 00:05:56,030
How are you, Madam Pimp?

81
00:05:56,113 --> 00:05:58,198
It's very bad of you to call me that!

82
00:05:58,616 --> 00:05:59,951
Just be frank, why not?

83
00:06:00,034 --> 00:06:01,034
You should be frank!

84
00:06:01,117 --> 00:06:03,828
Your hat, is like the mourning uniform!

85
00:06:03,912 --> 00:06:05,247
Has your dad passed away?

86
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:08,874
I feel happy to talk in this way

87
00:06:10,084 --> 00:06:13,170
Mr Chiu, you helped me to terminate the Hairy Gang,

88
00:06:13,254 --> 00:06:15,381
the emperor will give you an award for this

89
00:06:16,172 --> 00:06:17,924
I'll appreciate it if you

90
00:06:18,007 --> 00:06:19,342
speak something nice in front of the emperor

91
00:06:20,885 --> 00:06:22,553
Please have the towel

92
00:06:26,765 --> 00:06:29,059
Mr So has come

93
00:06:29,518 --> 00:06:31,060
Congratulations!

94
00:06:31,144 --> 00:06:32,228
This way…

95
00:06:32,311 --> 00:06:34,563
Mr So, today is your big day, you must be very happy!

96
00:06:34,647 --> 00:06:36,858
We have some new girls, you must be satisfied with them

97
00:06:36,941 --> 00:06:38,066
What are they? Goldfish, or cooked fish?

98
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:40,027
What does that mean?

99
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:42,070
You idiot! Goldfish are for watching only

100
00:06:42,154 --> 00:06:43,447
Cooked fish can be eaten

101
00:06:44,322 --> 00:06:45,906
Cooked fish of course

102
00:06:46,198 --> 00:06:48,075
You, cooked fish, why don't you come and serve Mr So?

103
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:51,203
Mr So, you are the superior master today

104
00:06:51,287 --> 00:06:53,205
What kind of woman do you want? Just tell me

105
00:06:53,621 --> 00:06:55,706
I won't mind, every woman is just the same

106
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:56,833
Nothing special

107
00:07:02,546 --> 00:07:04,089
Mr So, what's the matter?

108
00:07:04,882 --> 00:07:06,008
I am attacked

109
00:07:06,091 --> 00:07:06,757
What? Who dared so?

110
00:07:06,841 --> 00:07:08,468
I will hit that bastard's mouth for you

111
00:07:08,551 --> 00:07:09,469
She didn't use her mouth

112
00:07:09,552 --> 00:07:10,636
She used her eyes

113
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,639
Tempting, and I smell blood I haven't seen such eyesight before

114
00:07:14,389 --> 00:07:16,266
Who is she?

115
00:07:16,349 --> 00:07:18,351
Miss Yushang comes to be a part-time hooker only

116
00:07:18,435 --> 00:07:20,520
Is Mr Chiu interested to sleep with her?

117
00:07:20,604 --> 00:07:21,938
You should ask His Majesty first

118
00:07:22,021 --> 00:07:23,356
How is it? Your Majesty?

119
00:07:23,981 --> 00:07:26,609
We are friends, just go ahead if you want!

120
00:07:26,692 --> 00:07:28,443
Mr Chiu, help yourself

121
00:07:29,402 --> 00:07:30,737
Thank you then

122
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:31,779
The room service please

123
00:07:32,155 --> 00:07:35,158
Yushang, come and greet Mr Chiu

124
00:07:38,368 --> 00:07:39,160
Sister, he is the one we want

125
00:07:39,286 --> 00:07:40,662
He killed dad

126
00:07:41,163 --> 00:07:42,039
I know, stay calm

127
00:07:42,122 --> 00:07:42,788
Let's go

128
00:07:42,872 --> 00:07:43,790
May I be excused

129
00:07:43,873 --> 00:07:45,541
Mr Chiu, Miss Yushang has arrived

130
00:07:48,419 --> 00:07:52,047
How are you, Mr Chiu?

131
00:07:57,176 --> 00:07:58,219
A pretty woman!

132
00:08:00,054 --> 00:08:02,932
Mr Chiu, about tonight…

133
00:08:03,015 --> 00:08:04,141
100,000 taels

134
00:08:04,225 --> 00:08:07,144
if Miss Yushang sleeps with our young master tonight…

135
00:08:07,227 --> 00:08:08,812
You are not welcome

136
00:08:08,895 --> 00:08:11,688
I am sorry, I am damn sorry

137
00:08:11,772 --> 00:08:12,815
Don't you have any objection?

138
00:08:13,899 --> 00:08:16,443
Let me say something fair

139
00:08:16,527 --> 00:08:17,862
If any of you can offer

140
00:08:17,945 --> 00:08:19,237
more than 100,000 taels

141
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,988
Yushang will sleep with them

142
00:08:21,072 --> 00:08:22,699
Don't quarrel because of such a small amount,

143
00:08:22,782 --> 00:08:24,325
isn't it right?

144
00:08:24,408 --> 00:08:26,075
Pal, you are a big spender

145
00:08:27,494 --> 00:08:29,162
The cheque is too simple to me

146
00:08:30,914 --> 00:08:34,750
I have a pearl which is granted by the Royal family, it's invaluable!

147
00:08:38,254 --> 00:08:39,964
I love the pearl more

148
00:08:41,881 --> 00:08:44,550
Mr Chiu, I will wait for you in my room

149
00:08:45,385 --> 00:08:47,095
Is the pearl worth 100,000 taels?

150
00:08:48,011 --> 00:08:50,138
Don't you think that's too little for you?

151
00:08:50,222 --> 00:08:51,432
I love money too

152
00:08:52,182 --> 00:08:53,684
But, I don't like you

153
00:08:57,395 --> 00:08:59,856
You are frank! I love it very much

154
00:08:59,939 --> 00:09:00,898
Mr So…

155
00:09:00,982 --> 00:09:01,816
It doesn't matter,

156
00:09:01,899 --> 00:09:03,525
I think, my hat doesn't match me

157
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:06,695
Yushang doesn't like me, I deserve it

158
00:09:06,778 --> 00:09:07,988
I am glad you understand this

159
00:09:08,071 --> 00:09:08,947
Don't worry,

160
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:10,572
I have many pretty girls here

161
00:09:10,656 --> 00:09:13,534
I trust your arrangement

162
00:09:16,495 --> 00:09:17,996
None of my business

163
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:19,455
How bold are you?

164
00:09:29,089 --> 00:09:31,424
Mantis Fist? It seems to be powerful

165
00:09:31,507 --> 00:09:32,466
Music!

166
00:09:40,223 --> 00:09:41,057
Keep this

167
00:09:42,267 --> 00:09:42,893
See my Crane's Fists!

168
00:09:42,976 --> 00:09:43,727
The Tiger's Claws!

169
00:09:48,731 --> 00:09:51,651
How can a mantis fight with a tiger?

170
00:09:52,401 --> 00:09:54,027
I know Tiger Claws and Crane's Fists too!

171
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:57,447
Well, try me, mantis!

172
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,877
Bravo…

173
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,253
Your Tiger's claws are defeated

174
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:18,548
Actually it's not Tiger's Claws,

175
00:10:18,632 --> 00:10:20,092
it's beggar's fists!

176
00:10:20,425 --> 00:10:21,593
That's why it's too weak

177
00:10:28,265 --> 00:10:29,266
You move fast!

178
00:10:29,599 --> 00:10:30,725
It seems to be powerful…

179
00:10:32,685 --> 00:10:35,563
Kid, you don't know how the wind blows

180
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:44,237
The general of Canton has arrived

181
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,031
Get lost…

182
00:10:47,698 --> 00:10:49,658
Who dares bully my son, let me teach him a lesson

183
00:10:50,493 --> 00:10:51,284
Master

184
00:10:51,368 --> 00:10:52,828
Don't panic, Chan who bullied you?

185
00:10:52,911 --> 00:10:53,829
It's me who bullied others

186
00:10:53,912 --> 00:10:55,414
What? You bullied others?

187
00:10:55,789 --> 00:10:57,624
How much does he have? Is he qualified to be bullied by you?

188
00:10:58,125 --> 00:10:59,083
Master, they are the ones

189
00:10:59,166 --> 00:10:59,625
Who are they?

190
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:01,084
Just take a look

191
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,379
The King of Iron Hat?

192
00:11:07,382 --> 00:11:08,300
Send the gift

193
00:11:08,383 --> 00:11:09,009
Chan

194
00:11:09,092 --> 00:11:10,635
They send you such a valuable present, you'd stop bullying them

195
00:11:11,136 --> 00:11:12,262
Come on, give tips to the girls here

196
00:11:12,345 --> 00:11:13,053
Master

197
00:11:13,137 --> 00:11:15,389
King of Iron Hat, Seng-ko-lin-ch'in, is written on the medal

198
00:11:26,107 --> 00:11:27,566
How dare you seize the medal of His Majesty?

199
00:11:28,066 --> 00:11:28,692
Cuff him

200
00:11:28,775 --> 00:11:31,027
Hold it, according to the Ching's law,

201
00:11:31,111 --> 00:11:33,655
Courtier is not allowed hooking

202
00:11:33,738 --> 00:11:35,155
Now, you are in the brothel

203
00:11:35,239 --> 00:11:37,283
Do you know you have violated the laws of Ching?

204
00:11:37,783 --> 00:11:38,701
How about you?

205
00:11:39,493 --> 00:11:40,369
- You mean me?    - Yes!

206
00:11:40,453 --> 00:11:42,496
That's right, I come…

207
00:11:42,579 --> 00:11:43,371
- to arrest…    - You!

208
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:45,123
- Him!    - Arrest him!

209
00:11:45,582 --> 00:11:46,666
I am the general of Canton,

210
00:11:46,749 --> 00:11:49,168
so I should arrest those bad people

211
00:11:49,251 --> 00:11:50,294
By the way…

212
00:11:50,335 --> 00:11:52,087
What else? Go ahead

213
00:11:52,754 --> 00:11:55,632
Today is the birthday of the Ex-Empress Dowager

214
00:11:55,716 --> 00:11:57,884
So your crime is doubled

215
00:11:57,967 --> 00:11:59,093
It may lead to capital punishment

216
00:11:59,177 --> 00:12:01,680
Kill him…

217
00:12:05,974 --> 00:12:07,142
According to the Ching laws,

218
00:12:07,225 --> 00:12:09,394
anyone without a tail should be killed

219
00:12:09,478 --> 00:12:11,354
So you…

220
00:12:14,231 --> 00:12:15,274
Do you want to see my hair?

221
00:12:15,357 --> 00:12:16,650
You can see as much as you want! Fat-head

222
00:12:16,734 --> 00:12:19,110
Cut the crap, just kill him

223
00:12:19,194 --> 00:12:21,113
OK, it's finished

224
00:12:21,446 --> 00:12:23,823
General So, let's play happily together, so forget it

225
00:12:23,907 --> 00:12:25,242
I haven't played!

226
00:12:26,158 --> 00:12:26,909
Your Majesty,

227
00:12:26,992 --> 00:12:29,244
a rascal has ruined the atmosphere here,

228
00:12:29,328 --> 00:12:30,162
I should be blamed for poor arrangement

229
00:12:30,829 --> 00:12:31,663
None of your business

230
00:12:32,372 --> 00:12:33,372
Let's go

231
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:38,878
Master, you can't fool this guy. Let's go

232
00:12:39,921 --> 00:12:40,546
OK, go

233
00:12:41,797 --> 00:12:43,757
Just forget the trouble

234
00:12:46,635 --> 00:12:48,928
Young master, your hat

235
00:12:55,892 --> 00:12:57,018
He is great!

236
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:09,030
Uncle Mok, the dishes are all poisoned

237
00:13:09,112 --> 00:13:13,116
Chiu assassinated our Master

238
00:13:13,199 --> 00:13:15,201
and some generals of The Taiping Reign

239
00:13:15,284 --> 00:13:16,785
And he framed us, the Beggars Association, to be the assassins

240
00:13:17,536 --> 00:13:19,163
Thus made us

241
00:13:19,371 --> 00:13:20,914
to be despised by the world

242
00:13:21,832 --> 00:13:23,208
Saying that we became the dogs of the government

243
00:13:23,749 --> 00:13:25,918
I should ask him to pay for it

244
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:29,088
His initial power is harmful

245
00:13:29,171 --> 00:13:31,673
Don't take action until he is trapped

246
00:13:31,756 --> 00:13:34,133
Because we can't defeat him even if we group together

247
00:13:34,467 --> 00:13:36,010
I will try my best to seduce him to the bed

248
00:13:37,429 --> 00:13:38,679
Senior, somebody is coming

249
00:13:39,471 --> 00:13:40,514
Get ready…

250
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:50,440
Miss Yushang, we meet again

251
00:13:50,523 --> 00:13:52,525
Why do you come here? Where is Mister Chiu?

252
00:13:52,607 --> 00:13:53,942
The pearl of Mr. Chiu is broken

253
00:13:54,025 --> 00:13:55,985
by Mr So and became pearl powder

254
00:13:56,069 --> 00:13:57,362
I have drunk it

255
00:13:58,196 --> 00:14:00,072
Don't judge Mr. So from his hair,

256
00:14:00,156 --> 00:14:02,450
he is really romantic and funny

257
00:14:02,867 --> 00:14:03,534
But…

258
00:14:03,617 --> 00:14:05,953
Stop, I have taken his money, 100,000 taels, you know?

259
00:14:06,036 --> 00:14:07,620
I won't give it back.

260
00:14:07,954 --> 00:14:09,789
About the personality of Mr. So…

261
00:14:09,873 --> 00:14:11,500
Cut the crap, pimp!

262
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:12,417
Leave here first.

263
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,501
Yes, you are right.

264
00:14:14,043 --> 00:14:14,626
Miss Seven…

265
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:16,170
Just accept this.

266
00:14:20,966 --> 00:14:21,966
Who is this guy?

267
00:14:22,467 --> 00:14:23,426
I don't know

268
00:14:23,468 --> 00:14:26,471
Miss, first of all, I have a good news for you

269
00:14:27,054 --> 00:14:28,389
I love you

270
00:14:29,306 --> 00:14:31,350
To me, this is bad news

271
00:14:31,933 --> 00:14:33,601
I know you will reply like this

272
00:14:34,186 --> 00:14:34,978
Cut the crap

273
00:14:35,061 --> 00:14:36,228
I wish to pay you 100 pearls

274
00:14:36,312 --> 00:14:39,232
for your company tonight

275
00:14:39,315 --> 00:14:40,441
I don't want to talk to you

276
00:14:40,524 --> 00:14:41,567
Please get out

277
00:14:43,443 --> 00:14:44,569
I haven't chosen the wrong one

278
00:14:44,652 --> 00:14:46,571
OK, I will drink this wine first

279
00:14:47,489 --> 00:14:48,490
No…

280
00:14:54,787 --> 00:14:57,039
It surprised me

281
00:14:58,247 --> 00:14:58,831
Miss

282
00:14:58,915 --> 00:14:59,791
Hands off!

283
00:15:01,918 --> 00:15:02,961
You know kung fu?

284
00:15:03,961 --> 00:15:05,670
No, I don't know Kung-fu at all

285
00:15:06,254 --> 00:15:08,173
I beg you, stop bothering me

286
00:15:08,256 --> 00:15:09,382
I won't accompany you

287
00:15:09,466 --> 00:15:12,010
Yushang, no one treats me like this

288
00:15:12,676 --> 00:15:14,553
I have found that I am in love with you

289
00:15:16,305 --> 00:15:17,348
What?

290
00:15:17,848 --> 00:15:20,767
I have been in love with you

291
00:15:22,435 --> 00:15:23,561
Are you kidding?

292
00:15:23,937 --> 00:15:26,356
I am not kidding, I decided to marry you

293
00:15:27,481 --> 00:15:28,565
Are you nuts?

294
00:15:30,275 --> 00:15:31,276
Kidding?

295
00:15:34,071 --> 00:15:35,530
Is there anyone hiding here?

296
00:15:39,117 --> 00:15:40,994
That's good, I want a witness

297
00:15:41,077 --> 00:15:42,160
Witness?

298
00:15:42,244 --> 00:15:44,747
Yes, I swear in front of your sword

299
00:15:45,372 --> 00:15:47,040
I do want to marry Miss Yushang as my wife, I am sincere

300
00:15:47,124 --> 00:15:49,292
If I cheat, I will be killed by thunder

301
00:15:50,584 --> 00:15:52,669
Sister, I feel excited for you

302
00:15:52,753 --> 00:15:53,712
Hey

303
00:15:55,297 --> 00:15:56,631
Don't you know it's not that easy to be my husband?

304
00:15:57,132 --> 00:15:58,550
How can I be your husband?

305
00:16:00,343 --> 00:16:02,095
I want him to be the superior Kung-fu master

306
00:16:02,178 --> 00:16:03,428
Be the top of all

307
00:16:03,512 --> 00:16:04,638
Can you do that?

308
00:16:05,597 --> 00:16:06,556
Let me think for one second

309
00:16:13,354 --> 00:16:14,272
I can do it

310
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:17,108
OK

311
00:16:17,191 --> 00:16:19,693
Do it first and then look for me

312
00:16:20,569 --> 00:16:23,489
Well, I think we should fix a date for our wedding

313
00:16:23,905 --> 00:16:26,532
Because, this is too easy for me to be the Kung-fu scholar!

314
00:16:27,491 --> 00:16:31,036
OK, but you'd give me some time to consider it.

315
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,622
No problem, I will wait for your answer outside the garden

316
00:16:34,581 --> 00:16:35,791
I won't leave until seeing you

317
00:16:39,918 --> 00:16:41,378
Crazy!

318
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:06,984
We come for the Beggars Association, those unrelated persons leave at once

319
00:18:04,033 --> 00:18:06,785
Sir, the timing is right

320
00:18:07,285 --> 00:18:09,162
The road is safe now, please go

321
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:13,250
Good, very good

322
00:18:15,793 --> 00:18:16,669
Let's go!

323
00:18:29,221 --> 00:18:31,682
Shit, we are late

324
00:18:33,016 --> 00:18:34,601
That Manchurian should be blamed

325
00:18:41,607 --> 00:18:43,441
Sister…

326
00:18:43,525 --> 00:18:44,276
What's the matter?

327
00:18:44,401 --> 00:18:45,569
The idiot is still there

328
00:18:46,111 --> 00:18:46,820
Let's kill him

329
00:18:47,028 --> 00:18:49,364
Forget it, he doesn't mean to bother us

330
00:18:49,448 --> 00:18:50,740
Let him go

331
00:19:02,959 --> 00:19:04,586
Are you fond of him?

332
00:19:05,127 --> 00:19:06,170
What did you say?

333
00:19:06,253 --> 00:19:07,629
I won't fall in love with anybody

334
00:19:07,713 --> 00:19:09,840
until Chiu is killed

335
00:19:09,923 --> 00:19:11,133
Especially him

336
00:19:11,924 --> 00:19:13,676
Chiu is good at Kung-fu

337
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:17,097
Mok said, we can't defeat him unless using the “Dragon Killing Palms”

338
00:19:18,181 --> 00:19:19,473
So, I can never marry!

339
00:19:20,015 --> 00:19:22,017
Let's go, if you want to marry

340
00:19:40,742 --> 00:19:42,826
What evil are you? How dare you scare me?

341
00:19:43,869 --> 00:19:46,663
Mr So, it's me!

342
00:19:48,748 --> 00:19:49,707
You are the pimp?!

343
00:19:49,791 --> 00:19:51,126
Yes!

344
00:19:51,209 --> 00:19:52,836
You have a flat figure, where are your busts?

345
00:19:52,919 --> 00:19:55,796
It's early in the morning, they haven't woken up yet

346
00:19:56,338 --> 00:19:57,881
It's lucky of you for not being killed

347
00:19:57,964 --> 00:19:59,674
Don't go around if you haven't made up yet

348
00:19:59,758 --> 00:20:00,842
I won't do it again

349
00:20:01,635 --> 00:20:05,471
Stop waiting for Miss Yushang, she left

350
00:20:06,389 --> 00:20:07,265
What?

351
00:20:11,518 --> 00:20:12,978
Where is she going?

352
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:17,564
She… she is going to Peking

353
00:20:18,273 --> 00:20:19,274
Peking?

354
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:24,529
Men should contribute to the country

355
00:20:24,612 --> 00:20:28,616
Where should I put my pigtail?

356
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,702
Swing and swing…

357
00:20:30,785 --> 00:20:32,786
I pull it and play it…

358
00:20:32,869 --> 00:20:34,120
Dad!

359
00:20:34,955 --> 00:20:36,540
I decided to join the examination for the scholar of Martial Arts

360
00:20:36,873 --> 00:20:38,249
Chan

361
00:20:38,792 --> 00:20:40,918
I have been longing for this word for 25 years

362
00:20:41,001 --> 00:20:42,753
For the sake of our family, you should do that

363
00:20:42,837 --> 00:20:45,006
Don't misunderstand it, I do it not for no one

364
00:20:45,089 --> 00:20:45,881
But for a woman

365
00:20:45,965 --> 00:20:47,132
What a hero!

366
00:20:47,507 --> 00:20:49,676
For a girl, you want to be the scholar of Martial Arts!

367
00:20:49,801 --> 00:20:50,760
Who is that girl?

368
00:20:50,844 --> 00:20:53,096
The hooker of Yee Hung Brothel, Miss Yushang

369
00:20:53,179 --> 00:20:54,346
For a hooker?

370
00:20:55,889 --> 00:20:56,890
What's wrong with it?

371
00:20:57,641 --> 00:21:00,310
You have different taste, you are great!

372
00:21:00,394 --> 00:21:01,603
I am admiring you!

373
00:21:01,686 --> 00:21:02,687
I will accompany you to Peking

374
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:03,980
2, 3, 4, 5, 6

375
00:21:04,063 --> 00:21:06,357
I am coming

376
00:21:06,441 --> 00:21:08,859
Young master is going for the examination, let's move to Peking too

377
00:21:11,236 --> 00:21:12,529
Stop chasing,

378
00:21:12,612 --> 00:21:14,864
we won't take the hens with us

379
00:21:14,948 --> 00:21:18,451
Be careful!

380
00:21:18,534 --> 00:21:20,953
If you break my stuff, I will teach you a good lesson

381
00:21:21,579 --> 00:21:22,537
Be careful!

382
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:24,331
Good morning dad

383
00:21:24,414 --> 00:21:24,998
Good morning

384
00:21:25,081 --> 00:21:25,957
You want to move everything to Peking?

385
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:26,792
Sure

386
00:21:26,875 --> 00:21:28,543
Please leave me a cloth

387
00:21:28,626 --> 00:21:30,335
You are only a kid, you don't need this

388
00:21:30,753 --> 00:21:31,712
But I am not small

389
00:21:33,297 --> 00:21:35,633
Are you bigger than mine?

390
00:21:35,924 --> 00:21:36,716
You despise me!

391
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:37,800
Mine will be bigger than yours one day

392
00:21:37,884 --> 00:21:40,762
Let's find something, say trousers to cover it

393
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:42,054
I don't want to see it

394
00:21:42,138 --> 00:21:44,890
Why are you standing here for? Why don't you remove it?

395
00:21:46,308 --> 00:21:47,935
It's a hard job to remove such a big house!

396
00:21:48,018 --> 00:21:49,811
Please, work hard, men!

397
00:21:49,895 --> 00:21:53,689
Ready, 1, 2, 3, push!

398
00:21:54,065 --> 00:21:57,652
Push!

399
00:21:57,735 --> 00:21:58,860
Be careful!

400
00:21:59,235 --> 00:22:00,820
Tie it well…

401
00:22:00,862 --> 00:22:02,155
Master, do you want to move the tree too?

402
00:22:02,238 --> 00:22:03,281
Sure,

403
00:22:03,365 --> 00:22:05,367
or how can I eat Lychee in Peking?

404
00:22:06,034 --> 00:22:07,451
Push it over…

405
00:22:08,619 --> 00:22:11,705
Be careful

406
00:22:11,789 --> 00:22:14,416
Take care of my Lychee, you fathead!

407
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,627
Chiu helped me to terminate

408
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:22,047
the Hairy Gang in Kwangsi

409
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:24,924
So I bring him here to greet Your Majesty

410
00:22:26,093 --> 00:22:30,722
Fine, I am now appointing you to be the Deputy Secretary

411
00:22:32,139 --> 00:22:35,141
Hope you will serve our Ching Dynasty wholeheartedly

412
00:22:35,767 --> 00:22:36,851
Thank you, Your Majesty

413
00:22:37,102 --> 00:22:40,188
Your Majesty, Mr Chiu is a magician

414
00:22:40,647 --> 00:22:43,566
Why don't you ask him to show you something?

415
00:22:43,649 --> 00:22:44,859
Magic?

416
00:22:47,194 --> 00:22:49,904
Mr Chiu, then show me your magic

417
00:22:50,029 --> 00:22:51,322
Yes, Your Majesty

418
00:25:07,148 --> 00:25:08,273
There is nothing surprising, go

419
00:25:08,399 --> 00:25:09,358
Yes

420
00:25:22,911 --> 00:25:25,831
I am sorry for scaring you

421
00:25:26,289 --> 00:25:28,500
If this girl is real, that's fantastic!

422
00:25:30,543 --> 00:25:31,878
Hurry up!

423
00:25:32,294 --> 00:25:34,838
What's the matter?

424
00:25:34,922 --> 00:25:37,924
Come on, go in

425
00:25:38,883 --> 00:25:39,884
What's the matter?

426
00:25:39,968 --> 00:25:43,096
Hide in here

427
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:46,014
Get ready, young master

428
00:25:47,182 --> 00:25:48,058
Come on

429
00:25:49,059 --> 00:25:50,561
Freeze, don't move

430
00:25:55,648 --> 00:25:58,692
Sweet smell, are you Piu Hung?

431
00:25:58,775 --> 00:26:01,069
You are great! I love it.

432
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:03,238
Closer

433
00:26:04,239 --> 00:26:06,490
So big! You must be Small!

434
00:26:06,907 --> 00:26:09,701
You are bad, how can you say that to me?

435
00:26:09,785 --> 00:26:10,661
You are big!

436
00:26:13,246 --> 00:26:15,749
What? Pregnant woman? You can't cheat me

437
00:26:15,832 --> 00:26:16,750
You are a dad.

438
00:26:16,833 --> 00:26:20,044
How bad are you, how can you guess that?

439
00:26:20,127 --> 00:26:21,462
Good boy

440
00:26:21,545 --> 00:26:25,674
I wanted to trick you actually, you are really smart.

441
00:26:26,884 --> 00:26:29,427
Young master has to join the examination tomorrow,

442
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:30,302
stop playing

443
00:26:30,386 --> 00:26:31,554
Get out…

444
00:26:32,722 --> 00:26:34,723
Chan, have you prepared

445
00:26:34,806 --> 00:26:36,057
for your examination?

446
00:26:36,141 --> 00:26:38,685
What should I prepare? I must win, don't you know that?

447
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:39,894
Yes I do!

448
00:26:40,979 --> 00:26:43,272
I have faith in you from seeing your behaviour!

449
00:26:43,939 --> 00:26:45,899
Chan, this is Uncle Cheng

450
00:26:45,983 --> 00:26:47,276
He will be the examiner

451
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,528
Say hello to Uncle Cheng

452
00:26:49,277 --> 00:26:51,571
How are you, Uncle Cheng?

453
00:26:54,491 --> 00:26:55,951
See

454
00:26:56,034 --> 00:26:58,285
Doesn't he seem to be the winner?

455
00:26:59,453 --> 00:27:00,454
It depends on fate.

456
00:27:01,538 --> 00:27:03,540
Cheng, I've asked someone

457
00:27:03,915 --> 00:27:05,250
to finish the papers which you gave me

458
00:27:05,625 --> 00:27:06,459
Will the questions be changed?

459
00:27:07,168 --> 00:27:08,836
Don't worry about the question paper

460
00:27:09,128 --> 00:27:10,379
But about the test of arrows shooting,

461
00:27:10,463 --> 00:27:12,089
riding, boxing and weapons…

462
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:13,548
He should try his best

463
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:14,591
Don't worry

464
00:27:14,675 --> 00:27:16,886
My son is keen on martial arts.

465
00:27:16,969 --> 00:27:20,305
So, can I deduct some from the payment of 2 million taels?

466
00:27:20,388 --> 00:27:22,849
We are friends, but that is business

467
00:27:30,355 --> 00:27:34,358
Let the Horse teams be the pioneer

468
00:27:34,441 --> 00:27:36,944
The arrows teams go sideways, the gunmen stay back

469
00:28:08,471 --> 00:28:13,350
The candidates come in

470
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:09,189
I can't lift it

471
00:29:12,026 --> 00:29:12,944
I don't want to waste my force

472
00:29:13,027 --> 00:29:15,487
Shameless? Damn you!

473
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:44,762
Oh, 10 marks

474
00:31:09,628 --> 00:31:12,213
The final race now starts

475
00:31:13,464 --> 00:31:14,590
The candidates,

476
00:31:14,673 --> 00:31:16,842
Po Ye Tat Tor from Mongolia

477
00:31:17,301 --> 00:31:20,970
Bravo…

478
00:31:21,054 --> 00:31:23,431
And So Cha Ha Yee Chan from Canton

479
00:31:26,850 --> 00:31:27,893
Last call

480
00:31:27,976 --> 00:31:30,979
So, one to ten Po, one to one

481
00:31:31,897 --> 00:31:35,149
Are you kidding, how can the betting rates differ so much?

482
00:31:35,566 --> 00:31:37,818
One to ten for Chan? Kidding?

483
00:31:38,277 --> 00:31:39,861
Why don't you have faith in Chan?

484
00:31:39,986 --> 00:31:44,324
That is, Chan defaulted in weight lifting

485
00:31:44,407 --> 00:31:47,659
Look, Po entered the final race

486
00:31:47,743 --> 00:31:50,454
with full marks, it differs

487
00:31:50,621 --> 00:31:53,707
It's an examination of the Scholar of Martial Arts, not king of coolie

488
00:31:54,207 --> 00:31:55,750
It's meaningless to be the champion of weight lifting

489
00:31:55,833 --> 00:31:57,293
You shouldn't put it that way

490
00:31:57,377 --> 00:31:58,420
What?

491
00:31:58,503 --> 00:31:59,838
He is smart

492
00:31:59,921 --> 00:32:02,131
I've studied this race for a long time

493
00:32:02,214 --> 00:32:03,841
I feel strange about the rate too

494
00:32:03,924 --> 00:32:07,761
Po is smart and strong

495
00:32:07,844 --> 00:32:10,512
But see the sweat of his neck

496
00:32:10,596 --> 00:32:13,015
I think it's because he is getting tired

497
00:32:13,099 --> 00:32:13,808
Really?

498
00:32:14,809 --> 00:32:16,101
But this So

499
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:17,102
What do you think?

500
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:18,436
He has been disappointing the audience

501
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:21,398
But he has worked very hard

502
00:32:21,523 --> 00:32:22,940
What?

503
00:32:23,023 --> 00:32:26,485
He tried very hard

504
00:32:26,610 --> 00:32:29,404
So I want to bet on him

505
00:32:29,488 --> 00:32:31,280
How much do you want to bet?

506
00:32:31,823 --> 00:32:33,116
800,000 taels

507
00:32:33,199 --> 00:32:35,743
Why not 2 million taels?

508
00:32:35,827 --> 00:32:38,120
What? Why are you so optimistic about Chan?

509
00:32:38,203 --> 00:32:39,746
You have good analysis

510
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:40,497
I feel Chan

511
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:42,582
will be the champion

512
00:32:43,542 --> 00:32:45,168
Come on

513
00:32:46,335 --> 00:32:47,253
I want to bet more on him

514
00:32:47,336 --> 00:32:48,003
Really?

515
00:32:48,129 --> 00:32:48,921
2 million taels!

516
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,006
How generous!

517
00:32:51,799 --> 00:32:53,300
Why don't you bet?

518
00:32:53,592 --> 00:32:55,803
Why should I bet? He is my son

519
00:32:57,345 --> 00:33:00,347
Shit, I miss one thing out of my calculation

520
00:33:00,764 --> 00:33:01,598
What?

521
00:33:01,682 --> 00:33:02,641
The blood

522
00:33:04,810 --> 00:33:06,769
Here comes the Examiner

523
00:33:09,939 --> 00:33:10,940
What? Isn't Cheng the examiner?

524
00:33:15,444 --> 00:33:16,445
Please take a seat

525
00:33:19,239 --> 00:33:20,282
Seng-ko-lin-ch'in?!

526
00:33:20,782 --> 00:33:21,615
What's the problem?

527
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:25,369
He is the uncle of Po

528
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:28,830
Let's start

529
00:33:33,335 --> 00:33:34,586
Start!

530
00:34:05,111 --> 00:34:07,196
Bravo…

531
00:34:07,572 --> 00:34:10,492
They should add 2 more marks for that powerful shoot

532
00:34:10,575 --> 00:34:12,326
I do think so

533
00:34:15,579 --> 00:34:19,082
So's arrow isn't on the target, Po won this section

534
00:34:25,838 --> 00:34:28,381
Kidding? Damn you! They are cheating

535
00:34:32,761 --> 00:34:34,971
The candidates please get on the horses

536
00:34:38,057 --> 00:34:39,016
Mr Chiu

537
00:34:43,103 --> 00:34:45,731
Take these with you, maybe you will find them useful

538
00:34:46,398 --> 00:34:48,900
Here comes the 2nd round

539
00:35:19,301 --> 00:35:20,636
They tricked again

540
00:35:21,553 --> 00:35:24,513
It's corrupt! May I give up the betting?

541
00:35:49,035 --> 00:35:50,411
Chan won this race

542
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:51,955
Did you tear the ticket?

543
00:35:52,038 --> 00:35:53,330
Not yet

544
00:36:06,592 --> 00:36:07,967
Are you kidding?

545
00:37:09,729 --> 00:37:11,105
Once again?!

546
00:37:17,194 --> 00:37:18,987
OK, let's start from the very beginning, I'll fight with a single hand and leg

547
00:37:19,113 --> 00:37:20,488
I won't take your advantage

548
00:37:31,665 --> 00:37:33,375
How can you use such a dirty stance?

549
00:37:33,458 --> 00:37:35,084
Have you woken?

550
00:37:35,876 --> 00:37:37,461
Bravo! He won

551
00:37:37,545 --> 00:37:39,464
Have some tea

552
00:37:39,547 --> 00:37:40,757
All the best!

553
00:37:41,257 --> 00:37:42,799
What did

554
00:37:42,883 --> 00:37:43,634
you say?

555
00:37:43,717 --> 00:37:45,510
It's English

556
00:37:45,594 --> 00:37:46,595
It's English

557
00:37:47,137 --> 00:37:48,597
There is no regulation stating that a weapon is not allowed

558
00:37:49,014 --> 00:37:52,308
You fell down first, Po is the winner again

559
00:37:56,228 --> 00:37:57,437
Damn you Cheng!

560
00:37:57,604 --> 00:37:59,439
You betrayed me!

561
00:37:59,522 --> 00:38:00,898
I will beat you to death

562
00:38:00,982 --> 00:38:01,983
if I see you again

563
00:38:02,650 --> 00:38:04,151
Forget it, you won't see him anymore

564
00:38:04,234 --> 00:38:04,985
Why?

565
00:38:05,068 --> 00:38:05,944
I am now going to kill him!

566
00:38:06,028 --> 00:38:06,904
I don't have 2 million to lose!

567
00:38:08,989 --> 00:38:10,032
Just kidding

568
00:38:10,449 --> 00:38:11,532
You shameless

569
00:38:11,782 --> 00:38:16,161
Po is the Scholar of Martial Arts

570
00:38:16,704 --> 00:38:18,830
I did win! Objection

571
00:38:36,930 --> 00:38:37,973
What are you doing?

572
00:38:38,056 --> 00:38:41,642
The dart is poisoned

573
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:45,437
He deserves it!

574
00:38:48,898 --> 00:38:50,650
He was poisoned by his own dart

575
00:38:51,275 --> 00:38:53,861
Well, my son will be the Scholar then

576
00:38:53,986 --> 00:38:54,903
I am going to be rich!

577
00:38:55,028 --> 00:38:56,238
Yes!

578
00:39:05,287 --> 00:39:07,414
Thank you, my ancestors!

579
00:39:07,498 --> 00:39:08,666
You have good judgement

580
00:39:11,501 --> 00:39:13,503
Sir, His Majesty wants to appoint the title himself

581
00:39:21,468 --> 00:39:25,429
I want to take some statements from you as record

582
00:39:25,555 --> 00:39:28,141
You won this time, who are you going to thank?

583
00:39:28,224 --> 00:39:29,392
Miss Yushang!

584
00:39:30,685 --> 00:39:33,562
Is Miss Yushang your mom?

585
00:39:38,274 --> 00:39:40,777
Long life to you!

586
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,027
Please get up

587
00:39:42,111 --> 00:39:43,154
Thank you

588
00:39:45,072 --> 00:39:47,782
Who is the new Scholar of Martial Arts?

589
00:39:50,034 --> 00:39:53,078
Your Majesty, So Chan from Canton is the Scholar this year

590
00:39:56,373 --> 00:39:58,542
Your Majesty, I am So Cha Ha Yee Chan

591
00:40:01,085 --> 00:40:02,753
Your Majesty, I want to report something

592
00:40:05,673 --> 00:40:06,424
Go ahead

593
00:40:08,216 --> 00:40:10,218
I have found that So is illiterate

594
00:40:10,677 --> 00:40:12,304
So how could he answer the question paper of strategy?

595
00:40:12,387 --> 00:40:13,388
That should be a trick

596
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:19,226
Take the stationery out!

597
00:40:19,310 --> 00:40:20,311
Yes

598
00:40:25,273 --> 00:40:28,568
So Cha Ha Yee Chan, write your name now

599
00:40:30,652 --> 00:40:33,029
Thank God, he knows how to write his name!

600
00:40:33,113 --> 00:40:34,781
He can write his name!

601
00:40:48,210 --> 00:40:49,002
I don't know how to write

602
00:40:51,003 --> 00:40:52,129
That's shit!

603
00:40:53,130 --> 00:40:54,089
Kill him now

604
00:40:54,673 --> 00:40:55,841
No! No!

605
00:40:58,052 --> 00:40:59,386
Your Majesty, I am the one who cheated

606
00:40:59,469 --> 00:41:00,345
It's none of his business

607
00:41:00,428 --> 00:41:01,387
Just chop me to death

608
00:41:01,471 --> 00:41:02,681
No, you should kill me

609
00:41:02,847 --> 00:41:03,514
Sorry dad

610
00:41:03,598 --> 00:41:04,682
I don't know how to write my name

611
00:41:04,766 --> 00:41:05,849
Stop, I have known it already

612
00:41:05,974 --> 00:41:07,434
Your Majesty, I should be killed

613
00:41:07,559 --> 00:41:08,143
Kill me

614
00:41:08,227 --> 00:41:09,019
No, kill me

615
00:41:09,102 --> 00:41:09,811
Kill me

616
00:41:09,895 --> 00:41:10,604
Your Majesty, you'd better kill me

617
00:41:10,687 --> 00:41:12,813
Shit, are you giving order?

618
00:41:13,397 --> 00:41:14,648
You two cooperated to cheat me

619
00:41:15,358 --> 00:41:17,068
The Secretary for Justice, announce the penalty for them

620
00:41:18,027 --> 00:41:21,321
Come out! Hurry up

621
00:41:21,947 --> 00:41:23,866
I am here!

622
00:41:27,952 --> 00:41:28,953
He is the Secretary for Justice

623
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:31,956
So's family should be

624
00:41:32,039 --> 00:41:33,415
sentenced to death

625
00:41:35,375 --> 00:41:37,961
But their ancestors achieved a lot for Ching, they can be exempted

626
00:41:38,044 --> 00:41:41,172
But, their fortune should be forfeited

627
00:41:41,964 --> 00:41:43,007
Have you carried out any military duty?

628
00:41:43,590 --> 00:41:45,717
I haven't gone back to my camp for 7 years, I haven't done anything

629
00:41:47,177 --> 00:41:49,679
So, he didn't miscarry any duty

630
00:41:51,305 --> 00:41:51,806
So, the maximum penalty

631
00:41:51,889 --> 00:41:54,600
is forfeiture of property only

632
00:41:58,395 --> 00:42:00,147
What? Are you sure?

633
00:42:00,897 --> 00:42:02,524
I am fair

634
00:42:02,649 --> 00:42:04,984
I judge it from the Law Book

635
00:42:06,610 --> 00:42:08,070
Can I add something?

636
00:42:08,946 --> 00:42:11,614
Sure, since you are the Emperor

637
00:42:12,031 --> 00:42:14,742
I want them to be beggars for the rest of their lives

638
00:42:15,285 --> 00:42:17,454
Why couldn't you find out they cheated during the examination?

639
00:42:17,995 --> 00:42:19,205
Luckily Chiu reported it to me on time

640
00:42:19,288 --> 00:42:22,208
Chiu, you would be rewarded

641
00:42:24,877 --> 00:42:28,671
I am wandering…

642
00:42:28,754 --> 00:42:31,048
That's the spirit tablet of my dad, do you want to take it too?

643
00:42:33,133 --> 00:42:35,052
It's useless for you

644
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:45,394
How poor are we…

645
00:42:45,477 --> 00:42:51,857
I am thinking of my better half…

646
00:42:51,941 --> 00:42:52,942
Young master,

647
00:42:53,693 --> 00:42:54,818
from now on,

648
00:42:54,902 --> 00:42:56,904
you'd be hard working to learn how to write

649
00:43:00,949 --> 00:43:07,788
But I can't sell the affection…

650
00:43:11,249 --> 00:43:12,167
Professor

651
00:43:13,710 --> 00:43:14,711
I will learn it

652
00:43:15,795 --> 00:43:20,424
I regret that…

653
00:43:20,966 --> 00:43:23,634
Master, I will take good care of little turtle

654
00:43:23,801 --> 00:43:25,052
I am sorry

655
00:43:25,136 --> 00:43:27,722
We haven't given birth to any baby of yours

656
00:43:27,805 --> 00:43:29,056
It doesn't matter

657
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:31,141
It's all my fault

658
00:43:31,308 --> 00:43:32,100
If I did better,

659
00:43:32,184 --> 00:43:34,103
you could have many babies

660
00:43:34,186 --> 00:43:34,895
But I think

661
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:36,939
Chan is enough for me

662
00:43:38,189 --> 00:43:39,357
Why are you standing here? Go now

663
00:43:39,482 --> 00:43:41,025
Master, we are leaving

664
00:43:41,108 --> 00:43:42,151
We are leaving, master

665
00:43:42,235 --> 00:43:43,445
Go, go now

666
00:43:46,154 --> 00:43:47,155
We are free

667
00:43:47,739 --> 00:43:49,699
I feel so happy

668
00:43:51,910 --> 00:43:53,786
How happy are we!

669
00:43:54,370 --> 00:43:55,621
Go in…

670
00:43:55,704 --> 00:43:56,914
Hurry up…

671
00:43:56,997 --> 00:43:58,165
How is it?

672
00:43:59,166 --> 00:44:00,708
Why are they so happy?

673
00:44:00,792 --> 00:44:01,960
What happened?

674
00:44:02,001 --> 00:44:03,878
I am very happy

675
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:05,922
Please go in…

676
00:44:06,005 --> 00:44:07,005
Welcome…

677
00:44:07,965 --> 00:44:11,135
Damn sequestration, I wanna cry, my son

678
00:44:11,218 --> 00:44:13,345
Hold it, don't lose our face

679
00:44:13,428 --> 00:44:14,428
Keep on laughing

680
00:44:16,097 --> 00:44:18,266
Son

681
00:44:18,349 --> 00:44:19,642
Have you kept any money?

682
00:44:19,725 --> 00:44:20,935
No, how about you?

683
00:44:21,018 --> 00:44:22,435
I forgot that

684
00:44:25,063 --> 00:44:28,483
Shit, damn sequestration!

685
00:44:30,776 --> 00:44:34,446
Be merciful,

686
00:44:34,989 --> 00:44:36,448
please give money to us

687
00:44:36,531 --> 00:44:38,283
Son, that guy is like dad

688
00:44:38,992 --> 00:44:40,035
You mean the one who sings?

689
00:44:40,451 --> 00:44:42,328
No, the one who pays

690
00:44:42,412 --> 00:44:44,872
He is more disgusting than the one who sings

691
00:44:44,955 --> 00:44:47,541
Not exactly, he is smart

692
00:44:49,042 --> 00:44:50,126
Dad should be blamed

693
00:44:50,210 --> 00:44:51,961
I always called you beggar

694
00:44:52,295 --> 00:44:53,421
Now, it becomes true

695
00:44:53,504 --> 00:44:54,463
What's wrong with you?

696
00:44:54,547 --> 00:44:55,798
The emperor wants us to be beggars

697
00:44:55,923 --> 00:44:57,258
Do you think we'd be beggars?

698
00:44:57,341 --> 00:44:59,384
I am smart, I am keen in kung-fu fighting

699
00:44:59,467 --> 00:45:01,260
Even the Gods won't let me be beggars

700
00:45:01,344 --> 00:45:02,303
That's true

701
00:45:02,387 --> 00:45:03,221
Am I like a beggar?

702
00:45:03,305 --> 00:45:04,306
No

703
00:45:05,055 --> 00:45:06,932
Buy something to eat, you beggars

704
00:45:09,059 --> 00:45:11,103
You treat us as beggars?

705
00:45:11,187 --> 00:45:12,979
Damn you!

706
00:45:13,062 --> 00:45:15,481
It's weird! Let's eat

707
00:45:18,985 --> 00:45:20,944
Chan, since we have nothing to do

708
00:45:21,028 --> 00:45:22,363
Let me take a seat,

709
00:45:22,488 --> 00:45:23,906
maybe we can have something to eat tonight

710
00:45:23,989 --> 00:45:25,365
You are treating yourself a beggar?

711
00:45:25,949 --> 00:45:27,032
Dad, don't worry

712
00:45:27,074 --> 00:45:28,826
I need no begging for money

713
00:45:28,910 --> 00:45:30,078
How can you get money if you don't beg?

714
00:45:30,161 --> 00:45:31,079
Just ask someone to give us money

715
00:45:31,245 --> 00:45:32,788
Pal, may I know your name?

716
00:45:33,997 --> 00:45:34,831
Nau Tai Chung

717
00:45:34,915 --> 00:45:36,041
Do you have money?

718
00:45:36,124 --> 00:45:36,875
Yes

719
00:45:36,958 --> 00:45:37,834
Just give it to me

720
00:45:37,918 --> 00:45:38,627
OK

721
00:45:43,255 --> 00:45:44,047
Thank you

722
00:45:44,089 --> 00:45:46,091
Why should I give you money?

723
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:47,843
Why do you ask so many questions?

724
00:45:47,927 --> 00:45:49,261
But I should know the reason

725
00:45:49,344 --> 00:45:51,388
Anyway, you should pay it

726
00:45:51,471 --> 00:45:53,515
No, let's fix it up first

727
00:45:55,974 --> 00:45:57,350
Just give it to us, why are you asking so much?

728
00:45:57,434 --> 00:45:58,143
Hands off

729
00:45:58,227 --> 00:45:59,061
You mean robbing?

730
00:45:59,102 --> 00:46:00,562
Robbery…

731
00:46:01,730 --> 00:46:03,439
I am not robbing, I am begging

732
00:46:03,523 --> 00:46:07,360
Begging? How dare you, you beggar, you are cheating me!

733
00:46:07,443 --> 00:46:10,528
Don't you think I am stupid? I am smart, you know?

734
00:46:10,612 --> 00:46:11,655
Hey, two days passed,

735
00:46:11,738 --> 00:46:13,615
It's cold and I am hungry now

736
00:46:13,698 --> 00:46:15,450
Have you had any ideas?

737
00:46:15,826 --> 00:46:16,702
I have a friend's girlfriend

738
00:46:17,118 --> 00:46:19,620
who is living in Peking

739
00:46:20,913 --> 00:46:22,832
She always admires you

740
00:46:22,915 --> 00:46:24,083
Really?

741
00:46:24,124 --> 00:46:27,084
Yes, if you are willing to date her

742
00:46:27,126 --> 00:46:29,670
I think she will help us to go back to Canton

743
00:46:29,754 --> 00:46:32,214
But, you have to sacrifice

744
00:46:32,297 --> 00:46:33,465
Do you mean…

745
00:46:33,549 --> 00:46:36,010
For our family, just as you said

746
00:46:36,093 --> 00:46:37,845
I know it's very hard for you

747
00:46:37,928 --> 00:46:39,054
Cut the crap, let's go and find her

748
00:46:39,138 --> 00:46:40,138
I have arranged it

749
00:46:40,763 --> 00:46:43,224
The one wearing the red dress who stands under the lantern, that's her

750
00:46:49,563 --> 00:46:50,564
Ghost!

751
00:46:56,026 --> 00:46:56,860
It's a benefit for you!

752
00:46:56,944 --> 00:46:59,071
Why don't you go yourself?

753
00:47:13,292 --> 00:47:15,211
Chan, I haven't tried this before

754
00:47:15,294 --> 00:47:16,127
Be careful!

755
00:47:16,210 --> 00:47:17,503
Don't worry

756
00:47:17,587 --> 00:47:18,421
I'll take care of you

757
00:47:18,504 --> 00:47:20,172
You want to earn money for shark-fins, right?

758
00:47:20,256 --> 00:47:21,132
Right…

759
00:47:23,175 --> 00:47:26,136
Get lost…

760
00:47:26,261 --> 00:47:27,471
No show here

761
00:47:31,182 --> 00:47:33,101
We just want to earn some money

762
00:47:33,184 --> 00:47:34,185
to go back to Canton

763
00:47:34,643 --> 00:47:37,146
Don't be that mean to us

764
00:47:39,314 --> 00:47:40,273
It's the Royal instruction that

765
00:47:40,607 --> 00:47:42,984
the So's family'd be beggars for life

766
00:47:43,109 --> 00:47:45,152
You two can only be beggars

767
00:47:45,652 --> 00:47:47,863
I am carrying my duty only. Men!

768
00:47:47,988 --> 00:47:48,614
Yes!

769
00:47:48,697 --> 00:47:49,489
Remove all the things

770
00:47:49,573 --> 00:47:50,574
Yes

771
00:47:53,451 --> 00:47:54,744
Help!

772
00:47:54,785 --> 00:47:56,704
Master Chiu, it's hard for one to carry it

773
00:47:56,787 --> 00:47:59,455
Ask more men to remove it

774
00:47:59,539 --> 00:48:00,582
Yes

775
00:48:03,126 --> 00:48:03,960
What do you want?

776
00:48:04,044 --> 00:48:05,003
No, we can't move it

777
00:48:05,086 --> 00:48:05,753
Let me do it

778
00:48:05,837 --> 00:48:06,712
You want a fight, don't you?

779
00:48:08,047 --> 00:48:09,549
Last time you could escape from Yee Hung Hostel

780
00:48:09,965 --> 00:48:11,383
But you won't be that lucky this time

781
00:48:15,929 --> 00:48:16,847
He is powerful!

782
00:48:16,930 --> 00:48:17,889
I've got to defeat him

783
00:48:17,972 --> 00:48:19,390
by one powerful strike

784
00:48:19,474 --> 00:48:21,433
I can't give him another chance to counterattack

785
00:48:42,576 --> 00:48:46,038
Chan…

786
00:48:46,122 --> 00:48:48,291
Chan…

787
00:48:48,374 --> 00:48:50,208
Your legs and hands

788
00:48:50,333 --> 00:48:51,459
are all broken by me

789
00:48:52,627 --> 00:48:54,212
You will be a cripple for the rest of your life

790
00:48:56,381 --> 00:48:58,674
You want to fight? Not now!

791
00:48:59,508 --> 00:49:02,469
But, you can beg for money

792
00:49:03,220 --> 00:49:04,345
Be a good beggar

793
00:49:06,222 --> 00:49:10,101
Go, go away…

794
00:49:18,483 --> 00:49:22,194
Don't panic, Chan, it's OK

795
00:49:23,487 --> 00:49:29,617
Don't panic, you'll be all right… Chan!

796
00:49:31,244 --> 00:49:34,288
I went to the examination hall

797
00:49:34,455 --> 00:49:36,165
with my son,

798
00:49:36,248 --> 00:49:38,250
don't you know who was the examiner?

799
00:49:38,292 --> 00:49:41,085
He is Seng-ko-lin-ch'in, that bastard.

800
00:49:41,169 --> 00:49:44,255
He was the enemy of us!

801
00:49:44,589 --> 00:49:46,091
About our story…

802
00:49:46,174 --> 00:49:47,676
Let me stop here first, I want a smoke.

803
00:49:49,301 --> 00:49:51,136
It's better to smoke now.

804
00:49:51,219 --> 00:49:53,012
Yes, it's better.

805
00:49:53,096 --> 00:49:56,432
We let him go in

806
00:49:56,515 --> 00:49:58,434
the Yee Hung Brothel.

807
00:49:58,517 --> 00:50:00,436
But he framed us in return.

808
00:50:00,519 --> 00:50:02,603
He tricked my son

809
00:50:02,687 --> 00:50:04,981
during the examination.

810
00:50:05,064 --> 00:50:08,276
But, my son was really smart and great

811
00:50:08,318 --> 00:50:10,402
He finally won the race

812
00:50:10,486 --> 00:50:11,404
To be the greatest Kung-fu fighter, invincible

813
00:50:11,487 --> 00:50:13,364
Be the top

814
00:50:13,447 --> 00:50:15,240
Can you do that?

815
00:50:15,324 --> 00:50:16,283
Sure!

816
00:50:16,325 --> 00:50:17,325
Well

817
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:20,161
Come back to me if you can do that

818
00:50:21,829 --> 00:50:23,664
I think we should fix our wedding date first

819
00:50:23,748 --> 00:50:26,667
Because being the scholar is too simple to me

820
00:50:36,467 --> 00:50:37,551
Write your name at once

821
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:41,471
I don't know how to write

822
00:50:52,189 --> 00:50:54,732
Chan, what's wrong with you?

823
00:50:58,111 --> 00:50:59,195
Nightmare again?

824
00:51:00,821 --> 00:51:01,905
Don't think so much!

825
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:10,038
Although you have taken

826
00:51:10,246 --> 00:51:11,831
2 months' rest,

827
00:51:12,665 --> 00:51:14,083
your legs and hands have not been totally recovered.

828
00:51:15,542 --> 00:51:16,710
Coming

829
00:51:17,085 --> 00:51:19,754
I am going to beg for food

830
00:51:20,213 --> 00:51:21,548
I will make the last herbal tea

831
00:51:21,631 --> 00:51:22,673
for you later

832
00:51:23,298 --> 00:51:25,091
Dad, you go begging again?

833
00:51:25,592 --> 00:51:27,636
This job should be left to me

834
00:51:27,719 --> 00:51:29,262
You are the Scholar…

835
00:51:32,515 --> 00:51:35,810
Chan, to be a beggar,

836
00:51:35,893 --> 00:51:37,644
there are some lessons!

837
00:51:38,186 --> 00:51:40,689
You can't just show your hand and beg for money

838
00:51:40,772 --> 00:51:43,608
At least you should have a bowl, that represents your class

839
00:51:43,692 --> 00:51:46,194
Is it ridiculous?

840
00:51:46,277 --> 00:51:48,279
Hurry up

841
00:51:49,780 --> 00:51:50,906
I am coming

842
00:51:52,115 --> 00:51:53,450
We can't beg for good if we are late!

843
00:51:53,533 --> 00:51:54,868
Yes…

844
00:52:14,843 --> 00:52:15,427
Give me money, please

845
00:52:15,510 --> 00:52:16,720
Go, go, I won't give you money

846
00:52:16,803 --> 00:52:20,431
Go, don't stop me from doing business

847
00:52:23,893 --> 00:52:24,977
Chan, dad is leaving

848
00:52:37,654 --> 00:52:40,615
Thank you…

849
00:52:47,413 --> 00:52:49,081
Thank you…

850
00:52:56,421 --> 00:52:57,421
Are you that mean?

851
00:52:57,505 --> 00:52:58,631
Why don't you write it yourself?

852
00:52:58,714 --> 00:53:01,508
You are off duty, so I just want to lend it.

853
00:53:02,510 --> 00:53:03,469
Don't you think I am an idiot?

854
00:53:38,499 --> 00:53:39,417
Dad!

855
00:53:41,501 --> 00:53:42,335
What are you doing?

856
00:53:42,794 --> 00:53:46,256
I am cold… I am cold… Chan

857
00:53:48,257 --> 00:53:51,385
No, your body is as hot as fire

858
00:53:52,511 --> 00:53:53,262
Are you sick?

859
00:53:53,345 --> 00:53:54,846
I am not…

860
00:53:56,472 --> 00:53:57,306
It's late

861
00:53:58,433 --> 00:53:59,893
I have to search for food

862
00:54:01,893 --> 00:54:03,853
Lie down, I will go this time

863
00:54:04,479 --> 00:54:05,647
Are you going for begging?

864
00:54:06,606 --> 00:54:08,525
I have my own way to get food

865
00:54:08,942 --> 00:54:09,900
Take a rest now

866
00:54:09,984 --> 00:54:11,444
I will take you to the doctor after getting some money

867
00:54:31,335 --> 00:54:32,711
You bastard, why don't you eat?

868
00:54:32,795 --> 00:54:35,172
You should eat more so as to be strong!

869
00:54:38,258 --> 00:54:39,259
Finish it

870
00:54:39,551 --> 00:54:40,552
No, I am full

871
00:54:40,635 --> 00:54:42,971
You should take all the food

872
00:54:43,930 --> 00:54:45,973
OK, just forget it, let's go home

873
00:54:47,308 --> 00:54:50,561
Come on, eat them all

874
00:54:53,605 --> 00:54:54,106
Little kid!

875
00:54:54,189 --> 00:54:54,940
What?

876
00:54:55,064 --> 00:54:55,731
May I…

877
00:54:55,815 --> 00:54:56,774
No

878
00:55:14,998 --> 00:55:21,087
Be merciful!

879
00:55:23,798 --> 00:55:28,720
Be merciful to me, please

880
00:55:31,096 --> 00:55:33,307
My dad is dying!

881
00:55:35,517 --> 00:55:37,476
Beggar, do you want the broken carbon?

882
00:55:37,559 --> 00:55:38,685
Thank you

883
00:55:39,603 --> 00:55:41,313
Can you give me some coins?

884
00:55:42,398 --> 00:55:44,107
It's you!

885
00:55:44,482 --> 00:55:45,316
No, you are mistaken

886
00:55:45,858 --> 00:55:47,318
Sister, it's him

887
00:55:47,610 --> 00:55:48,569
No, no

888
00:55:48,611 --> 00:55:50,488
Sister, he is So Chan

889
00:55:54,157 --> 00:55:55,033
Wait!

890
00:55:59,662 --> 00:56:01,622
Miss, who are you looking for?

891
00:56:04,041 --> 00:56:05,625
I am sorry, I was mistaken

892
00:56:06,084 --> 00:56:07,627
Tracy, take some dumplings out

893
00:56:08,002 --> 00:56:10,004
You have mistaken, he is not So Chan

894
00:56:11,589 --> 00:56:12,631
You are like my friend

895
00:56:13,549 --> 00:56:16,218
Come to get some dumplings if you get nothing to eat

896
00:56:17,136 --> 00:56:18,638
We always have surplus

897
00:56:20,388 --> 00:56:21,097
Dumplings

898
00:56:21,222 --> 00:56:22,181
Take it

899
00:56:25,893 --> 00:56:27,477
Thank you…

900
00:56:30,230 --> 00:56:30,981
Sister, he wouldn't be that poor

901
00:56:31,064 --> 00:56:33,817
if it were not for you

902
00:56:47,537 --> 00:56:49,580
Dad, what are you doing?

903
00:56:49,663 --> 00:56:52,166
I can't stand the hunger.

904
00:56:52,249 --> 00:56:55,669
So I bit the dumpling of the kid.

905
00:56:56,419 --> 00:56:58,004
I have a dumpling, take it back

906
00:56:58,087 --> 00:56:58,879
Could I pay you another head

907
00:56:58,963 --> 00:57:01,048
if I chopped yours?

908
00:57:03,467 --> 00:57:04,843
Are you the Scholar?

909
00:57:06,970 --> 00:57:09,139
Yes, are you the Scholar?

910
00:57:10,514 --> 00:57:11,223
I was nearly the Scholar

911
00:57:11,307 --> 00:57:12,892
He is the Scholar!

912
00:57:13,267 --> 00:57:14,727
We should give him face

913
00:57:14,810 --> 00:57:16,687
Thank you

914
00:57:16,771 --> 00:57:18,897
Hold it

915
00:57:21,066 --> 00:57:22,693
Are they going to treat me

916
00:57:22,776 --> 00:57:25,111
some food?

917
00:57:28,822 --> 00:57:29,740
The dog's rice

918
00:57:30,657 --> 00:57:33,868
Sir, I will let your dad go if you eat the dog's rice now

919
00:57:38,956 --> 00:57:39,831
What's the matter?

920
00:57:40,624 --> 00:57:41,625
Come on

921
00:57:52,051 --> 00:57:53,636
Chan, don't eat that

922
00:57:53,719 --> 00:57:55,178
You can't face the others if you eat this

923
00:57:56,179 --> 00:57:58,014
Let's forget about me

924
00:57:58,348 --> 00:58:00,809
Sir, I was a general in Canton

925
00:58:02,726 --> 00:58:03,393
So what?

926
00:58:03,477 --> 00:58:04,395
Stop fighting

927
00:58:04,478 --> 00:58:05,854
Stand properly

928
00:58:13,236 --> 00:58:14,988
The Scholar eats the dog's food

929
00:58:16,655 --> 00:58:17,739
It's quite delicious

930
00:58:20,617 --> 00:58:22,911
Try some. Come on

931
00:58:26,789 --> 00:58:29,333
It's delicious, isn't it?

932
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:35,213
Dad, look!

933
00:58:36,047 --> 00:58:37,298
There is a slice of meat here

934
00:58:37,382 --> 00:58:39,300
It's pork chop!

935
00:58:49,475 --> 00:58:51,102
They are as hungry as dogs!

936
00:58:51,185 --> 00:58:53,019
Enjoy the dog food!

937
00:58:55,230 --> 00:58:57,816
Hurry, finish it

938
00:58:59,067 --> 00:59:00,234
That's too delicious!

939
00:59:00,609 --> 00:59:02,611
I want to save it for a midnight snack

940
00:59:02,695 --> 00:59:03,613
It's very clever of you!

941
00:59:03,946 --> 00:59:05,781
You deserve to be beggars

942
00:59:08,324 --> 00:59:09,784
The Scholar is eating dog food

943
00:59:09,951 --> 00:59:11,077
Come on, let's go and eat the man's food

944
00:59:17,541 --> 00:59:18,667
Uncle So!

945
00:59:23,546 --> 00:59:24,839
You are…

946
00:59:25,339 --> 00:59:26,924
My dad was the Master of the Beggars' Association

947
00:59:27,300 --> 00:59:29,510
Why don't you join our Beggars' Association

948
00:59:29,968 --> 00:59:31,094
Uncle Mok, isn't it a good idea?

949
00:59:31,178 --> 00:59:32,012
Good

950
00:59:32,095 --> 00:59:33,763
Isn't it the association for beggars?

951
00:59:33,805 --> 00:59:34,681
Yes!

952
00:59:34,765 --> 00:59:36,641
That's right, we are being beggars

953
00:59:36,724 --> 00:59:38,768
It's wise to join the Beggars' Association so as to be taken care of

954
00:59:38,809 --> 00:59:41,186
Chan… where is that fool going?

955
00:59:41,270 --> 00:59:42,438
Where is Chan?

956
00:59:42,521 --> 00:59:43,813
OK, we will join you!

957
00:59:43,897 --> 00:59:46,233
Chan… Chan…

958
00:59:58,409 --> 01:00:01,037
Yushang, good year!

959
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:03,205
Uncle Mok, happy new year!

960
01:00:03,289 --> 01:00:04,540
This is for you

961
01:00:04,956 --> 01:00:06,249
Thank you

962
01:00:08,335 --> 01:00:09,586
One cloth is for you

963
01:00:09,669 --> 01:00:10,753
and the other is for Chan

964
01:00:11,755 --> 01:00:13,214
Thank you. Put it down first

965
01:00:14,924 --> 01:00:15,716
Do you have any coins?

966
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:16,634
Yes!

967
01:00:16,717 --> 01:00:17,801
Give them to me, come on

968
01:00:17,843 --> 01:00:18,802
What for?

969
01:00:18,844 --> 01:00:20,720
It's new year,

970
01:00:20,804 --> 01:00:22,556
you should receive red pocket

971
01:00:22,639 --> 01:00:24,182
Come on, happy new year

972
01:00:24,808 --> 01:00:25,517
Good year!

973
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:26,809
Wish you ever beauty

974
01:00:26,850 --> 01:00:27,601
Thank you…

975
01:00:27,684 --> 01:00:28,685
Uncle Mok, we needn't give red packets to each other

976
01:00:28,769 --> 01:00:29,853
How about Chan

977
01:00:30,187 --> 01:00:34,565
Chan?

978
01:00:34,732 --> 01:00:35,858
He is still sleeping

979
01:00:35,942 --> 01:00:38,069
Don't wake him up

980
01:00:38,903 --> 01:00:40,363
I will cook you some new year cakes

981
01:00:40,987 --> 01:00:43,781
Let me help you

982
01:00:45,325 --> 01:00:47,035
How can he sleep on the 1st day of this year?

983
01:00:48,411 --> 01:00:50,246
He is useless

984
01:00:53,249 --> 01:00:54,208
Are you all here?

985
01:00:55,126 --> 01:00:57,878
To fight against Chiu, we need a union of the Beggars' Association

986
01:00:59,254 --> 01:01:01,590
So we must choose a new master to be in charge of the association

987
01:01:02,881 --> 01:01:04,800
Yushang…

988
01:01:05,968 --> 01:01:07,803
To defeat the Lotus position of the three seniors

989
01:01:07,886 --> 01:01:08,887
You should try your best

990
01:01:09,722 --> 01:01:12,599
Uncle, I don't have faith in defeating them

991
01:01:13,057 --> 01:01:14,850
Judging from my kung-fu now,

992
01:01:14,934 --> 01:01:17,436
how can I defeat them and become the new master?

993
01:01:19,229 --> 01:01:22,441
Take this Taiwan pill, after this, your power will be improved

994
01:01:23,191 --> 01:01:26,110
No, this is the only medicine to cure your inner injury

995
01:01:26,193 --> 01:01:27,277
How can I take this?

996
01:01:27,695 --> 01:01:28,863
Don't worry,

997
01:01:28,904 --> 01:01:31,115
you can ask my son to fight for you

998
01:01:31,198 --> 01:01:33,783
He was a scholar of Martial Arts before…

999
01:01:33,867 --> 01:01:34,951
Before…

1000
01:01:35,035 --> 01:01:36,578
Look at him, he is so lazy,

1001
01:01:36,661 --> 01:01:38,663
he knows sleeping only

1002
01:01:39,038 --> 01:01:40,873
He is not even qualified to be a beggar!

1003
01:01:40,956 --> 01:01:42,458
Don't be that frank, can you?

1004
01:01:43,917 --> 01:01:45,293
Don't shout that loudly, OK?

1005
01:01:54,176 --> 01:01:58,681
Chan, no matter how they despise you,

1006
01:02:00,265 --> 01:02:01,932
I have faith in you

1007
01:02:03,059 --> 01:02:04,936
Although you lost your power

1008
01:02:05,478 --> 01:02:07,021
With your background,

1009
01:02:07,396 --> 01:02:08,897
only if you try hard,

1010
01:02:08,938 --> 01:02:10,982
you can achieve something.

1011
01:02:11,399 --> 01:02:13,401
But I am now powerless, I don't want to fight again

1012
01:02:13,485 --> 01:02:14,736
You have power!

1013
01:02:14,819 --> 01:02:15,777
Come on, beat me

1014
01:02:19,865 --> 01:02:21,116
See, that was powerful

1015
01:02:21,492 --> 01:02:23,118
Well, being a people…

1016
01:02:23,659 --> 01:02:25,244
Forget it, don't waste time

1017
01:02:25,328 --> 01:02:26,871
Why don't you let me sleep?

1018
01:02:33,043 --> 01:02:33,794
Why did you lock the door?

1019
01:02:33,877 --> 01:02:35,003
Enjoy sleeping

1020
01:02:49,891 --> 01:02:50,683
Son,

1021
01:02:50,767 --> 01:02:53,477
I tried very hard to get this for you

1022
01:02:53,894 --> 01:02:56,980
Try hard to practise, be good

1023
01:03:20,042 --> 01:03:21,125
Why do you go up?

1024
01:03:22,252 --> 01:03:23,920
Even you want me to practise Kung-fu,

1025
01:03:24,004 --> 01:03:26,340
you should give me a waddy first

1026
01:03:28,007 --> 01:03:29,634
I am sorry, catch it

1027
01:03:38,433 --> 01:03:41,102
Before being appointed an important task,

1028
01:03:41,185 --> 01:03:46,314
God will give you severe training for soul and flesh.

1029
01:03:53,404 --> 01:03:56,073
Did you write it?

1030
01:03:57,032 --> 01:04:01,912
It's ugly, it's right to wipe it away.

1031
01:04:03,913 --> 01:04:05,956
Hey, beggar?

1032
01:04:06,332 --> 01:04:06,958
Yes

1033
01:04:07,041 --> 01:04:07,917
Me too

1034
01:04:08,500 --> 01:04:09,501
Congratulations

1035
01:04:10,210 --> 01:04:12,002
Is there anything to eat?

1036
01:04:12,086 --> 01:04:13,087
No

1037
01:04:13,171 --> 01:04:14,673
Luckily, I have

1038
01:04:20,469 --> 01:04:23,305
See your look,

1039
01:04:23,388 --> 01:04:24,514
it's a waste for you not to beg

1040
01:04:25,140 --> 01:04:26,223
None of your damn business

1041
01:04:27,433 --> 01:04:28,726
You are too lazy to be a beggar!

1042
01:04:28,809 --> 01:04:30,352
Your fellows despise you

1043
01:04:32,938 --> 01:04:34,647
I was always respected by others

1044
01:04:35,106 --> 01:04:36,399
But now, I am despised

1045
01:04:37,067 --> 01:04:38,318
Dislike from you,

1046
01:04:38,401 --> 01:04:40,402
no one respected me before

1047
01:04:40,819 --> 01:04:43,905
Listen to me. Don't go!

1048
01:04:44,573 --> 01:04:48,826
I remembered once in Canton

1049
01:04:48,910 --> 01:04:51,871
A fool paid my living, including hooking

1050
01:04:51,954 --> 01:04:53,497
What a weird man

1051
01:04:56,375 --> 01:04:57,918
Kid, I remembered you

1052
01:04:58,627 --> 01:05:00,587
Me too

1053
01:05:00,671 --> 01:05:01,797
Hey, hurry up

1054
01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:03,339
Repay my money, I am in urgent need

1055
01:05:03,464 --> 01:05:04,548
If I had money,

1056
01:05:04,632 --> 01:05:07,009
I wouldn't be a beggar!

1057
01:05:11,096 --> 01:05:13,724
But, don't worry, you were my benefactor,

1058
01:05:13,807 --> 01:05:15,017
I will repay you one day

1059
01:05:16,850 --> 01:05:18,352
Thank you very much

1060
01:05:19,561 --> 01:05:20,896
But, you can't buy back what you lost

1061
01:05:21,188 --> 01:05:22,856
even if you have money again

1062
01:05:24,524 --> 01:05:25,400
What did I lose?

1063
01:05:25,483 --> 01:05:27,902
Pride and faith

1064
01:05:27,986 --> 01:05:29,696
And your woman too

1065
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:33,281
What are you?

1066
01:05:33,657 --> 01:05:37,619
I am Hung Yat-sun, nicknamed Old Bag Sun

1067
01:05:37,703 --> 01:05:41,164
I am the most senior one among the beggars

1068
01:05:41,247 --> 01:05:42,498
It's good to be a beggar

1069
01:05:42,957 --> 01:05:44,584
You can do everything you want

1070
01:05:44,667 --> 01:05:45,876
You can do the same

1071
01:05:45,959 --> 01:05:48,628
Tell me, what do you want? I will make your wish come true

1072
01:05:49,212 --> 01:05:50,088
I want to be human again

1073
01:05:50,171 --> 01:05:51,881
Don't you think you are not human-like?

1074
01:05:53,424 --> 01:05:54,759
Not at all

1075
01:05:54,842 --> 01:05:57,303
So you have to be a beggar now

1076
01:05:59,763 --> 01:06:02,390
Very good! Very good!

1077
01:06:02,974 --> 01:06:06,269
But I won't cheat you, from your head to toes

1078
01:06:06,352 --> 01:06:08,603
Every part of you is beggar-like

1079
01:06:10,147 --> 01:06:10,814
So what?

1080
01:06:10,897 --> 01:06:13,274
That means, you will be a beggar for your life

1081
01:06:16,193 --> 01:06:18,654
I don't want to talk to you, I want to sleep first

1082
01:06:19,155 --> 01:06:21,157
Don't go, you can achieve in your profession

1083
01:06:21,282 --> 01:06:22,365
From my judgement,

1084
01:06:22,449 --> 01:06:24,117
you will be the king of beggars

1085
01:06:24,659 --> 01:06:27,078
King of beggars, what does that mean?

1086
01:06:28,913 --> 01:06:29,955
That is beggar

1087
01:06:34,126 --> 01:06:36,086
I won't care who you are, I just want to stop the conversation.

1088
01:06:36,170 --> 01:06:38,129
Please step aside, don't stop me from sleeping.

1089
01:06:38,921 --> 01:06:39,922
Damn you!

1090
01:06:40,048 --> 01:06:42,259
No… I just want to sleep with you.

1091
01:06:43,509 --> 01:06:44,342
Idiot!

1092
01:06:48,430 --> 01:06:51,057
Kid, see you in the dream

1093
01:07:02,317 --> 01:07:04,736
Before the Buddha, the Disciples return to your position

1094
01:07:06,195 --> 01:07:09,448
To suppress the dragon and tiger

1095
01:07:16,454 --> 01:07:18,831
So Chan, you enjoyed the prosperity of the world

1096
01:07:18,915 --> 01:07:20,707
And you tasted the bitter fruit of the world too

1097
01:07:21,124 --> 01:07:22,417
Now you regret it

1098
01:07:22,793 --> 01:07:25,504
On behalf of Master Hung

1099
01:07:25,587 --> 01:07:27,172
I appoint you to be the “Sleeping Disciple”

1100
01:07:27,214 --> 01:07:31,092
Now, I will teach you the “Sleeping Disciple's Fist”!

1101
01:07:31,175 --> 01:07:33,636
Hope you can make good use of it Come on

1102
01:07:39,015 --> 01:07:43,393
Senior…

1103
01:07:48,524 --> 01:07:51,151
The bitter past

1104
01:07:56,072 --> 01:07:59,616
Long life to you…

1105
01:08:02,244 --> 01:08:04,787
Here comes the white Goat

1106
01:08:05,454 --> 01:08:09,583
My mother, give me power

1107
01:08:10,209 --> 01:08:11,251
To save the people!

1108
01:08:32,728 --> 01:08:34,438
Tomorrow the Emperor will go hunting

1109
01:08:34,855 --> 01:08:37,733
I will send him a pretty girl, so as to get close to him

1110
01:08:39,693 --> 01:08:42,862
Yuen Ling, you should seduce him tomorrow

1111
01:08:43,362 --> 01:08:44,238
Yes

1112
01:08:45,740 --> 01:08:47,157
If we can kill the Emperor,

1113
01:08:47,699 --> 01:08:49,075
I can take over his reign

1114
01:08:49,784 --> 01:08:52,287
I will give you a share of wealth!

1115
01:08:57,333 --> 01:09:00,795
Long life to you

1116
01:09:01,545 --> 01:09:02,253
Senior!

1117
01:09:02,337 --> 01:09:03,505
Let's go back now

1118
01:09:35,532 --> 01:09:36,158
Senior!

1119
01:09:36,241 --> 01:09:36,908
Let's go!

1120
01:09:50,045 --> 01:09:50,879
Senior!

1121
01:10:29,996 --> 01:10:30,705
Let's chase them

1122
01:10:30,788 --> 01:10:34,000
Stop The Emperor is setting off soon

1123
01:10:35,543 --> 01:10:36,668
You killed a woman…

1124
01:10:37,002 --> 01:10:38,170
You should replace her as a gift to the Emperor!

1125
01:10:44,550 --> 01:10:46,761
No one dares come up to fight for the leadership?

1126
01:10:47,344 --> 01:10:49,555
Ask Mok to give us the “Dog Hitting Waddy”!

1127
01:10:51,639 --> 01:10:55,518
Ask that old bag to hand us the waddy

1128
01:10:55,685 --> 01:10:58,812
Where have they been?

1129
01:10:59,396 --> 01:11:00,522
I don't know,

1130
01:11:01,231 --> 01:11:03,358
I saw them chat,

1131
01:11:03,400 --> 01:11:04,443
then they went away

1132
01:11:07,194 --> 01:11:08,362
Is there any affair between them?

1133
01:11:20,164 --> 01:11:21,499
Now, we are going to choose the new leader

1134
01:11:28,338 --> 01:11:29,297
Uncle Mok…

1135
01:11:29,380 --> 01:11:30,298
I am scared,

1136
01:11:30,381 --> 01:11:31,090
I think you won't come back.

1137
01:11:31,215 --> 01:11:32,299
How is it? Where is sister?

1138
01:11:33,426 --> 01:11:34,968
Your sister is caught by Chiu

1139
01:11:35,636 --> 01:11:37,596
We'd find someone to compete for the leadership.

1140
01:11:43,893 --> 01:11:45,353
Who should go?

1141
01:11:59,949 --> 01:12:00,533
I'll do it

1142
01:12:00,616 --> 01:12:01,408
Uncle Mok

1143
01:12:01,492 --> 01:12:02,994
Why don't you let me try?

1144
01:12:40,650 --> 01:12:41,609
Chan,

1145
01:12:43,528 --> 01:12:45,447
you are not qualified, come down

1146
01:12:47,030 --> 01:12:49,908
Since you don't have a good candidate, I'll give you some advantage

1147
01:12:50,450 --> 01:12:52,327
Chan, it's not a game

1148
01:12:52,744 --> 01:12:54,495
You will be killed, come down

1149
01:12:54,912 --> 01:12:57,581
It doesn't matter, I have forgotten my life already

1150
01:12:57,999 --> 01:12:59,042
Bullshit, throw him to death

1151
01:13:08,882 --> 01:13:10,509
Well, I will make your wish come true

1152
01:13:39,451 --> 01:13:39,993
What is he doing?

1153
01:13:40,076 --> 01:13:40,785
Sleeping

1154
01:13:55,632 --> 01:13:57,050
Isn't this stance…

1155
01:13:58,092 --> 01:14:00,093
Uncle Sun's "Sleeping Disciple's Fists"?

1156
01:14:01,094 --> 01:14:01,970
Set the position!

1157
01:14:18,318 --> 01:14:19,277
Is it dawn?

1158
01:15:17,953 --> 01:15:19,162
I am sorry!

1159
01:15:19,620 --> 01:15:20,538
I won.

1160
01:15:20,621 --> 01:15:21,831
What is the use for defeating us?

1161
01:15:21,914 --> 01:15:22,790
You don't know how to use the “Dog Hitting Waddy”.

1162
01:15:23,791 --> 01:15:24,834
You are not qualified to be the leader of us.

1163
01:15:28,378 --> 01:15:29,796
“Dog Hitting Waddy”?

1164
01:15:34,341 --> 01:15:35,467
It's for hitting dogs

1165
01:15:37,511 --> 01:15:38,846
I do know how to use this waddy!

1166
01:15:39,346 --> 01:15:40,347
But it's unlike from the standard stances!

1167
01:15:40,723 --> 01:15:41,348
It's quite powerful!

1168
01:15:46,269 --> 01:15:47,687
He broke the waddy!

1169
01:15:49,646 --> 01:15:51,898
He broke the treasure of our Association, let's kill him!

1170
01:16:05,994 --> 01:16:07,996
I am Master Hung, who dares go against me?

1171
01:16:09,456 --> 01:16:11,040
I set the rules of the association

1172
01:16:11,123 --> 01:16:13,959
Any student who defeated the Lotus Position

1173
01:16:14,043 --> 01:16:15,962
could be the leader

1174
01:16:16,587 --> 01:16:18,129
Have you all forgotten?

1175
01:16:18,755 --> 01:16:21,049
We become the biggest association

1176
01:16:21,132 --> 01:16:22,842
because of being united

1177
01:16:23,509 --> 01:16:25,719
I left you the “Dog Hitting Waddy”,

1178
01:16:25,802 --> 01:16:28,096
is just for memory

1179
01:16:28,513 --> 01:16:30,765
The waddy is meaningless

1180
01:16:30,849 --> 01:16:33,059
But you fools take this as treasure

1181
01:16:33,142 --> 01:16:36,312
And fight among yourselves for this damn waddy!

1182
01:16:36,395 --> 01:16:39,063
In these five years, you have had no leader, don't you feel shy?

1183
01:16:39,648 --> 01:16:40,941
So Chan broke the waddy,

1184
01:16:41,024 --> 01:16:42,150
so you won't fight for this anymore

1185
01:16:42,234 --> 01:16:43,485
He is correct to do so

1186
01:16:43,777 --> 01:16:45,153
This youngster is so junior,

1187
01:16:45,237 --> 01:16:46,696
but he is a genius, a smart ass

1188
01:16:46,779 --> 01:16:48,990
He is being taught by my disciple Hung Yat Sun

1189
01:16:49,073 --> 01:16:50,700
Who doesn't respect him is going against me too

1190
01:16:52,576 --> 01:16:53,659
You should respect him,

1191
01:16:53,743 --> 01:16:55,036
your new leader, and you'd love him,

1192
01:16:55,119 --> 01:16:58,664
whole-heartedly, to care much for him, maybe treat him dinner

1193
01:16:58,706 --> 01:16:59,916
Then, although I am in heaven,

1194
01:16:59,999 --> 01:17:03,919
I will bless all of you, all the best

1195
01:17:06,129 --> 01:17:07,631
Isn't it true?

1196
01:17:08,881 --> 01:17:10,716
You'd better trust it

1197
01:17:11,133 --> 01:17:13,344
Master Hung's soul talked to us,

1198
01:17:13,427 --> 01:17:15,261
we are blessed

1199
01:17:16,346 --> 01:17:18,723
They are easily cheated, I am really a genius!

1200
01:17:19,641 --> 01:17:20,851
We'll have a better living

1201
01:17:23,185 --> 01:17:25,062
What happened?

1202
01:17:26,897 --> 01:17:28,148
Let's greet the new Master

1203
01:17:31,526 --> 01:17:35,989
You should have faith, you won, bravo…

1204
01:17:37,823 --> 01:17:39,992
Uncle Mok, my son is really great!

1205
01:17:42,536 --> 01:17:44,245
I can't guess you have learnt the “Sleeping Disciple's Fists”?!

1206
01:17:46,455 --> 01:17:48,958
From now on, you are the new leader of us

1207
01:17:50,167 --> 01:17:52,043
This is the book of “Dragon Suppressing Stances”

1208
01:17:52,127 --> 01:17:53,754
And, I will give you the Taiwan Pill

1209
01:17:54,880 --> 01:17:56,840
Hope you will be a good leader

1210
01:17:58,133 --> 01:17:59,967
I just want to save Yushang as soon as possible

1211
01:18:02,136 --> 01:18:03,929
Yushang didn't make a wrong choice

1212
01:18:04,847 --> 01:18:09,184
Bravo! Bravo!

1213
01:18:13,770 --> 01:18:17,023
Uncle Mok, how are you?

1214
01:18:18,108 --> 01:18:20,110
Uncle Mok!

1215
01:18:21,527 --> 01:18:25,781
Uncle Mok…

1216
01:19:15,074 --> 01:19:15,992
Do you understand everything

1217
01:19:16,075 --> 01:19:18,493
written in this book?

1218
01:19:18,576 --> 01:19:19,952
Don't think that I am so foolish

1219
01:19:20,453 --> 01:19:21,829
After getting the help of Taiwan Pill,

1220
01:19:21,913 --> 01:19:24,833
My initial power is increased

1221
01:19:25,625 --> 01:19:28,210
I can control the 17 stances

1222
01:19:28,627 --> 01:19:31,296
But the last stance,

1223
01:19:31,380 --> 01:19:32,756
there is no picture or description of it.

1224
01:19:33,089 --> 01:19:34,340
I can't understand it at all

1225
01:19:34,840 --> 01:19:37,843
But Uncle Mok is dead, what'll we do now?

1226
01:19:38,386 --> 01:19:39,387
Just go ahead

1227
01:19:39,470 --> 01:19:41,596
No matter how, I have to save Yushang first

1228
01:20:53,450 --> 01:20:55,077
Check whether the camp is ready or not?

1229
01:20:55,160 --> 01:20:56,119
Yes!

1230
01:21:15,969 --> 01:21:16,928
Chiu,

1231
01:21:17,346 --> 01:21:19,890
why do you bring this woman here?

1232
01:21:19,973 --> 01:21:21,308
I know the Emperor loves pretty women

1233
01:21:21,391 --> 01:21:23,767
So I want to send him this gift

1234
01:21:24,227 --> 01:21:25,478
And I want to meet him too

1235
01:21:25,895 --> 01:21:28,022
There is no order from the Emperor

1236
01:21:28,648 --> 01:21:30,858
Men, come and take this woman to the camp

1237
01:21:30,941 --> 01:21:32,067
Yes

1238
01:21:32,651 --> 01:21:33,527
Go!

1239
01:21:36,487 --> 01:21:39,365
Sir, you look great!

1240
01:21:40,824 --> 01:21:42,701
I think you should go back

1241
01:21:43,077 --> 01:21:44,244
to your own position

1242
01:21:44,911 --> 01:21:45,954
Yes

1243
01:22:01,884 --> 01:22:02,718
Your Majesty,

1244
01:22:02,802 --> 01:22:04,804
Officer Chiu brings this woman to you

1245
01:22:05,762 --> 01:22:06,554
Woman?

1246
01:22:08,974 --> 01:22:10,142
Chiu knows my hobby!

1247
01:22:11,059 --> 01:22:13,269
I want to take a bath first, bring her to me later

1248
01:22:13,352 --> 01:22:14,353
Yes

1249
01:22:37,164 --> 01:22:40,209
This bastard wants to see the Emperor,

1250
01:22:41,419 --> 01:22:44,504
if I let him see His Majesty often, my post will be taken away

1251
01:22:49,633 --> 01:22:50,509
Men

1252
01:22:52,219 --> 01:22:53,053
Sir

1253
01:22:53,137 --> 01:22:54,305
Check what has happened

1254
01:22:54,388 --> 01:22:55,389
Yes

1255
01:22:58,808 --> 01:23:01,602
Sir, there are many people coming from the forest

1256
01:23:02,020 --> 01:23:03,146
Who are they?

1257
01:23:03,937 --> 01:23:04,938
I don't know!

1258
01:23:05,772 --> 01:23:06,523
Release the alarm smoke

1259
01:23:06,607 --> 01:23:07,358
Be alert

1260
01:23:07,441 --> 01:23:08,359
Yes

1261
01:23:17,783 --> 01:23:19,367
There is smoke ahead, let's get armed

1262
01:23:19,451 --> 01:23:20,285
Yes

1263
01:24:22,214 --> 01:24:23,214
Damn you beggars

1264
01:24:28,094 --> 01:24:30,013
So Chan, what are you doing?

1265
01:24:30,971 --> 01:24:34,141
Nothing, I just want to beg for money

1266
01:24:34,683 --> 01:24:36,935
Shit, do you want to be killed

1267
01:24:37,310 --> 01:24:38,477
It's you who will be killed

1268
01:24:40,020 --> 01:24:41,396
Chiu wants to raise a rebellion,

1269
01:24:41,480 --> 01:24:42,982
he is going to assassinate the king

1270
01:24:43,065 --> 01:24:44,275
You fat-headed

1271
01:24:45,483 --> 01:24:46,818
Who do you think you are?

1272
01:24:47,110 --> 01:24:49,529
How dare you frame the courtier?

1273
01:24:50,071 --> 01:24:52,115
I will kill you if you step forward

1274
01:24:56,660 --> 01:24:59,121
Chan, how can we fight with them?

1275
01:24:59,204 --> 01:25:00,287
- Senior    - Yes

1276
01:25:01,122 --> 01:25:02,165
Where are the rest of our men?

1277
01:25:02,248 --> 01:25:03,583
They are coming

1278
01:25:05,418 --> 01:25:06,544
We have no time,

1279
01:25:06,627 --> 01:25:08,169
you stay here to wait for the others

1280
01:25:08,253 --> 01:25:08,962
I will go first

1281
01:25:09,087 --> 01:25:09,671
I will follow

1282
01:25:09,754 --> 01:25:10,588
Be serious

1283
01:25:10,672 --> 01:25:12,132
Master, don't worry

1284
01:25:12,883 --> 01:25:14,384
Am I going to die?

1285
01:25:14,466 --> 01:25:16,134
Say something lucky, OK?

1286
01:25:16,510 --> 01:25:21,098
Sure! Happy birthday to you…

1287
01:25:21,140 --> 01:25:24,142
Happy birthday to you…

1288
01:25:24,559 --> 01:25:25,894
Happy birthday to you…

1289
01:25:25,977 --> 01:25:26,936
That's enough

1290
01:25:27,061 --> 01:25:28,020
I haven't finished

1291
01:25:28,104 --> 01:25:29,062
Go on after I left

1292
01:25:29,146 --> 01:25:30,189
Sure

1293
01:25:42,200 --> 01:25:44,201
There is smoke ahead, someone must have alarmed them.

1294
01:25:47,204 --> 01:25:48,038
Get ready the Unicom Smoke

1295
01:25:48,121 --> 01:25:48,622
Yes

1296
01:25:48,705 --> 01:25:49,664
Attack the main camp.

1297
01:26:50,633 --> 01:26:53,845
Rebel! Help!

1298
01:26:54,637 --> 01:26:55,471
They should be killed

1299
01:26:55,596 --> 01:26:57,472
The one who didn't kill you should be killed

1300
01:26:58,765 --> 01:27:00,976
Shit, the poisoned smoke

1301
01:27:01,059 --> 01:27:02,269
is blowing to the Royal camp

1302
01:27:08,440 --> 01:27:10,108
No, the wind direction changed

1303
01:27:10,859 --> 01:27:12,402
Yes, wait for me

1304
01:27:14,612 --> 01:27:16,739
If the beggars don't retreat now, we will kill with no mercy

1305
01:27:35,839 --> 01:27:36,840
Have a look

1306
01:27:41,218 --> 01:27:42,261
The Unicom Smoke of the Tin Li Sect

1307
01:27:53,313 --> 01:27:55,606
Be calm, urine is the antidote to the poison

1308
01:27:56,648 --> 01:27:58,900
Come and piss

1309
01:28:02,862 --> 01:28:04,489
How about me?

1310
01:28:05,156 --> 01:28:06,991
Don't worry, I can give you some urine

1311
01:28:07,074 --> 01:28:08,033
Come on, hold it

1312
01:28:14,456 --> 01:28:15,415
Rush in!

1313
01:28:24,798 --> 01:28:25,549
How is the situation?

1314
01:28:25,632 --> 01:28:27,634
Thanks for Your Majesty's luck, the wind direction changed

1315
01:28:27,759 --> 01:28:29,219
The smoke is going in the other direction

1316
01:28:29,302 --> 01:28:30,803
How about our armies?

1317
01:28:30,886 --> 01:28:32,596
They are all dead

1318
01:28:33,680 --> 01:28:34,556
Bring me the sword

1319
01:28:34,640 --> 01:28:35,599
Don't… don't!

1320
01:28:35,724 --> 01:28:37,266
Get lost! Get lost!

1321
01:28:37,308 --> 01:28:39,352
Your Majesty, it's dangerous, don't go!

1322
01:28:39,435 --> 01:28:42,313
Get lost, don't you want to wait for death? Get lost

1323
01:28:43,731 --> 01:28:44,773
You are ordered to get away

1324
01:28:45,440 --> 01:28:47,859
You can't go!

1325
01:29:26,268 --> 01:29:27,436
Protect me

1326
01:29:52,498 --> 01:29:53,374
Chan?

1327
01:29:55,543 --> 01:29:56,335
Yushang

1328
01:29:56,419 --> 01:29:57,711
How did you get here?

1329
01:29:58,336 --> 01:30:00,255
It's a long story

1330
01:30:00,338 --> 01:30:02,215
We left our base last night

1331
01:30:02,340 --> 01:30:03,466
We reached the Great Wall

1332
01:30:03,550 --> 01:30:05,801
this morning

1333
01:30:05,885 --> 01:30:07,887
We stayed one hour for lunch

1334
01:30:07,970 --> 01:30:09,346
I pissed once

1335
01:30:09,430 --> 01:30:10,264
Really?

1336
01:30:10,347 --> 01:30:11,597
Yes, then I want to eat a sweet potato

1337
01:30:11,723 --> 01:30:12,682
But only dumplings left

1338
01:30:12,765 --> 01:30:15,142
You know, I don't like eating dumplings

1339
01:30:16,311 --> 01:30:18,313
I am late to save you, please forgive me

1340
01:30:20,731 --> 01:30:21,482
To protect the Emperor

1341
01:30:21,982 --> 01:30:22,941
Yes

1342
01:30:26,277 --> 01:30:26,944
You betrayer!

1343
01:30:27,028 --> 01:30:27,737
Catch him

1344
01:30:34,201 --> 01:30:34,993
Your Majesty

1345
01:30:38,455 --> 01:30:40,248
You bastard, give your kingdom to me

1346
01:30:40,332 --> 01:30:41,457
Are you telling him?

1347
01:30:44,585 --> 01:30:45,377
It's you

1348
01:30:45,419 --> 01:30:47,046
Yes, I am Beggar So

1349
01:30:47,837 --> 01:30:50,798
Why don't you sleep in your hut?

1350
01:30:51,257 --> 01:30:53,426
Well, I am a little bit sleepy

1351
01:31:30,708 --> 01:31:31,499
“Sleeping Disciple”?

1352
01:31:32,042 --> 01:31:35,963
Yes. Look at you, you are like a beggar too

1353
01:31:36,046 --> 01:31:37,548
Are you interested in joining us?

1354
01:31:39,465 --> 01:31:41,592
I can't guess you could recover!

1355
01:31:42,051 --> 01:31:43,761
Yes, it's all because of you

1356
01:31:48,306 --> 01:31:50,308
Did you generate all your force? I didn't

1357
01:32:08,949 --> 01:32:12,077
Fool, only the “Dragon Suppressing Stances” scare me

1358
01:32:12,119 --> 01:32:13,871
I won't give a damn to any other stances

1359
01:32:26,423 --> 01:32:28,258
“Dragon Suppress Stances”

1360
01:32:30,926 --> 01:32:32,052
“Dragon in the sky”

1361
01:32:33,679 --> 01:32:34,388
“Dragon swings its tail”

1362
01:32:34,680 --> 01:32:35,389
“Dragon steals the heart”

1363
01:32:35,473 --> 01:32:36,265
Dragon swims, dragon in the field,

1364
01:32:36,432 --> 01:32:37,474
dragon dances…

1365
01:32:37,515 --> 01:32:38,474
Dragon's descendant,

1366
01:32:38,558 --> 01:32:39,601
dragon's wish…

1367
01:32:39,684 --> 01:32:40,935
Dragon's spirit, dragon's couple

1368
01:32:41,019 --> 01:32:42,395
Finished

1369
01:33:16,883 --> 01:33:19,386
You can't finish the last stance,

1370
01:33:19,469 --> 01:33:20,511
you can defeat me

1371
01:33:20,719 --> 01:33:21,720
after learning the 18th stance

1372
01:33:21,845 --> 01:33:23,096
But you have no chance

1373
01:33:31,437 --> 01:33:32,271
Chan!

1374
01:33:46,826 --> 01:33:49,078
I've got it Just mix the 17 stances,

1375
01:33:49,161 --> 01:33:50,119
it's the 18th stance then

1376
01:33:50,787 --> 01:33:52,414
I am too smart!

1377
01:34:22,440 --> 01:34:24,776
The 18 stance, “It's a regret to kill the Dragon”!

1378
01:34:54,884 --> 01:34:56,761
Chan, are you alright?

1379
01:34:57,178 --> 01:34:58,680
See, don't you think I am alright?

1380
01:34:59,597 --> 01:35:00,723
Your pose is really smart

1381
01:35:00,806 --> 01:35:02,598
But your look is awful!

1382
01:35:02,640 --> 01:35:03,724
Idiot, I am fine

1383
01:35:03,808 --> 01:35:05,101
I can marry tonight

1384
01:35:18,071 --> 01:35:18,613
Sister!

1385
01:35:18,696 --> 01:35:19,572
Tracy!

1386
01:35:19,655 --> 01:35:20,531
Where is Chiu?

1387
01:35:21,616 --> 01:35:22,534
He is around

1388
01:35:22,784 --> 01:35:24,118
Around?

1389
01:35:24,534 --> 01:35:25,785
He became ashes

1390
01:35:26,661 --> 01:35:28,288
Damn it!

1391
01:35:28,371 --> 01:35:29,664
Master

1392
01:35:29,748 --> 01:35:31,582
Chiu's fellows are all caught by us

1393
01:35:35,795 --> 01:35:36,879
Thank you, buddies

1394
01:35:41,049 --> 01:35:41,841
Yushang

1395
01:35:41,925 --> 01:35:43,593
We have an agreement, do you remember?

1396
01:35:44,969 --> 01:35:48,180
Yes, be the top of all.

1397
01:35:48,263 --> 01:35:50,474
Invincible

1398
01:35:50,808 --> 01:35:52,518
But, I can't be the Scholar

1399
01:35:52,600 --> 01:35:55,520
But I don't like Scholar at all.

1400
01:35:55,853 --> 01:35:57,271
I love beggars.

1401
01:35:59,232 --> 01:36:00,482
You first, I will go after you.

1402
01:36:14,078 --> 01:36:17,372
Seng-ko-lin-ch'in, you are really a fool

1403
01:36:17,455 --> 01:36:19,123
You bring a thief to harm me

1404
01:36:19,707 --> 01:36:21,459
Now, you are titled to be a beggar

1405
01:36:21,959 --> 01:36:24,295
You have potential to be a beggar

1406
01:36:25,045 --> 01:36:26,213
Report duty in the temple tomorrow

1407
01:36:26,839 --> 01:36:28,257
If there is anyone bullies you, just tell them my name

1408
01:36:29,924 --> 01:36:32,093
Thank you, thank you master

1409
01:36:32,176 --> 01:36:35,012
So Chan, what do you want as reward?

1410
01:36:37,973 --> 01:36:39,057
Don't you have anything to tell me?

1411
01:36:43,644 --> 01:36:45,688
Nothing special, let's go

1412
01:36:48,524 --> 01:36:50,234
Mister So!

1413
01:36:50,317 --> 01:36:51,484
Put it down

1414
01:36:51,860 --> 01:36:52,903
Although you have saved me,

1415
01:36:52,986 --> 01:36:55,447
if you don't respect me, I will kill you

1416
01:36:56,364 --> 01:36:58,574
If so, you needn't squat and talk to me

1417
01:36:59,366 --> 01:37:01,994
Don't move, it'll attract their attention

1418
01:37:04,913 --> 01:37:06,497
Actually we have no relation,

1419
01:37:06,581 --> 01:37:08,249
we have nothing to chat about

1420
01:37:08,750 --> 01:37:10,210
You have billions of fellows.

1421
01:37:10,293 --> 01:37:12,669
Your force makes me worry

1422
01:37:13,754 --> 01:37:15,798
The number of fellows doesn't depend on me,

1423
01:37:15,881 --> 01:37:16,965
but you

1424
01:37:17,048 --> 01:37:18,132
What?

1425
01:37:19,217 --> 01:37:21,844
If you are great, making the society peaceful and wealthy,

1426
01:37:22,219 --> 01:37:24,346
no one wishes to be a beggar, right?

1427
01:37:25,931 --> 01:37:27,640
It's reasonable

1428
01:37:27,724 --> 01:37:28,642
Be smart

1429
01:37:29,476 --> 01:37:30,477
But,

1430
01:37:31,102 --> 01:37:33,146
give me some face

1431
01:37:34,396 --> 01:37:35,230
Yes

1432
01:37:35,314 --> 01:37:37,733
Long life to Your Majesty

1433
01:37:37,775 --> 01:37:39,110
Get up

1434
01:37:45,239 --> 01:37:46,657
Pal, do you know me?

1435
01:37:47,158 --> 01:37:48,909
Of course! You beggar

1436
01:37:48,992 --> 01:37:50,702
You beg with your girl, you think I'll give you money out of mercy?

1437
01:37:50,786 --> 01:37:51,954
Yes, please give me money

1438
01:37:52,037 --> 01:37:54,206
No mercy, go away

1439
01:37:54,289 --> 01:37:55,290
No, you should pay me

1440
01:37:55,791 --> 01:37:57,083
It's a must, pal

1441
01:37:57,917 --> 01:38:00,378
A must? Kidding?

1442
01:38:00,836 --> 01:38:03,047
It's true, be quick

1443
01:38:03,130 --> 01:38:04,130
It's bad luck to meet you

1444
01:38:04,589 --> 01:38:05,548
Stop

1445
01:38:05,632 --> 01:38:06,466
What?

1446
01:38:06,549 --> 01:38:09,594
See my family? Give more

1447
01:38:09,677 --> 01:38:10,760
How much?

1448
01:38:10,803 --> 01:38:12,221
Not less than a thousand, got me?

1449
01:38:16,892 --> 01:38:18,434
Say thank you now

1450
01:38:18,518 --> 01:38:21,354
Thank you, uncle
