1
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,796
<i>Hey, let's go</i>

2
00:00:36,957 --> 00:00:38,913
<i>Hey, let's go</i>

3
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:42,834
<i>I'm happy as can be</i>

4
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,709
<i>Let's go walking you and me</i>

5
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,235
<i>Ready, set, come on, let's go</i>

6
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,754
<i>Over the hill, across the field</i>

7
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:58,549
<i>Through the tunnel we'll go</i>

8
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:02,030
<i>We'll run across the bridge</i>

9
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:06,557
<i>And down the bumpy gravel road</i>

10
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,315
<i>Right beneath the spider's web</I>

11
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:13,438
<i>Ready, set, let's go</i>

12
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,859
<i>Hey, let's go</i>

13
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:26,959
<i>Hey, let's go</i>

14
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:30,874
<i>I'm happy as can be</i>

15
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,715
<i>Let‘s go walking you and me</i>

16
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,440
<i>Ready, set, come on, let's go</i>

17
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:42,674
<i>The foxes and the badgers, too</i>

18
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:46,594
<i>All come out to play</i>

19
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:50,070
<i>They all want to explore</i>

20
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,677
<i>The deep and wonderful woods all day</i>

21
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,316
<i>Look at all my many friends</i>

22
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:01,432
<i>Ready, set, let's go</i>

23
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:06,390
<i>Look at all my many friends<i>

24
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,637
<i>Ready, set, let's go<i>

25
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,872
Dad, do you want a caramel?

26
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,833
Thanks. Aren't you tired?

27
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:41,552
All right.

28
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,949
We're almost there.

29
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,350
Mei, hide!

30
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,158
It wasn't a policeman.

31
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,839
Hello. Are your parents around?

32
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,279
Thanks.

33
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:48,319
I'm Kusakabe! We've just arrived!

34
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,270
A pleasure to meet you!

35
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,078
Welcome!

36
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,872
Thank you.

37
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,430
Here we are!

38
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,671
Wait!

39
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,033
Mei, there's a bridge!

40
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,235
A bridge?

41
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,749
See that flash? Fish too!

42
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,352
So, you like it here?

43
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,150
Dad, it's terrific!

44
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,958
Look, a tunnel of trees!

45
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,555
Is that our house?

46
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,398
Come on!

47
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,151
It's a wreck!

48
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,719
Wreck!

49
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,313
Looks like a haunted house!

50
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,310
Haunted?

51
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,309
And it's all rotten!

52
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,639
It's gonna fall down!

53
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,472
Fall down!

54
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,271
Look, Mei!

55
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,868
See?

56
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,752
It's huge.

57
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,874
Dad, there's a huge tree!

58
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,318
It's a camphor tree.

59
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,396
Camphor tree...

60
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,590
Oops!

61
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,276
An acorn!

62
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,712
Show me.

63
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,759
Another one!

64
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,388
One for me!

65
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,868
Out of the way. I can't open the screens.

66
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,475
Acorns!

67
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:03,035
There's acorns in the house.

68
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,599
They dropped from up there!

69
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:12,232
Maybe there are squirrels in here.

70
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,152
Squirrels, really?

71
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,030
Or rats that like acorns.

72
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,599
I'd rather have squirrels!

73
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,236
Where shall I put this?

74
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:27,436
Here, I'll get the door for you. Satsuki, open up the kitchen.

75
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,479
It's just round the back.

76
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,234
Mei, come on!

77
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,232
Wait for me!

78
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,352
Hurry!

79
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,549
Ready?

80
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,234
Bathtubs.

81
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,679
There's nothing here.

82
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:42,874
That's the bathroom.

83
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,792
Dad, there's something in here.

84
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,716
A squirrel?

85
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:50,590
Dunno. A bunch of black things but not roaches or mice.

86
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,592
Really?

87
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,229
Can you see 'em?

88
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,398
I think they were... soot gremlins.

89
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:11,433
'Gremlins'? Like in my picture book?

90
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:14,871
That's right. Ghosts don't come out on days like this.

91
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,590
When you walk into a dark room from outside,

92
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,714
your eyes dim and so the dustbunnies come out.

93
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,434
Oh, I see.

94
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:34,598
Come here, soot gremlins. Come out, come out, wherever you are!

95
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:44,431
Let's get to work! See if you can find how to get upstairs.

96
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,914
Get up there and open all the windows.

97
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,396
Sure!

98
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,914
I'm coming, too!

99
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,119
Toilet!

100
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,715
Not here!

101
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,269
Nothing here!

102
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,399
Nothing!

103
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,390
Mei, it's here!

104
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,552
It's pitch black!

105
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,392
Soot gremlins...

106
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,949
Another acorn.

107
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:08,035
Come out, soot gremlins!

108
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:51,195
Are you there, Mr. Soot Gremlin?

109
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:20,753
Dad, there's definitely something here!

110
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:26,916
That's exciting! I've always wanted to live in a haunted house.

111
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,279
I'm coming!

112
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,910
I got it. Satsuki!

113
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,675
Mei.

114
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,151
You're full of energy!

115
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:50,872
This is 'Nanny'. She looks after the house and came to help.

116
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,792
I'm Satsuki and this is my sister, Mei.

117
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,833
Nice to meet you both.

118
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:04,394
I'd have cleaned up if I'd known you'd be this quick.

119
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,831
No, you've done plenty.

120
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:12,279
Lately I've been so busy in the rice paddies, I only did a bit of dusting...

121
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:16,393
What have you done to your hands?

122
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,670
The soot gremlin got away...

123
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,956
Your feet, too!

124
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,837
Mine are black, too!

125
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:38,110
That must be the ‘soot sprites'.

126
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:44,589
Those little, black, fuzzy things that fly?

127
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:49,271
That's right. They breed in empty old houses,

128
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:52,995
and cover them with soot and dust.

129
00:14:54,280 --> 00:15:01,595
I could see them when I was little. Now you can too, huh?

130
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,279
Are they like goblins or something?

131
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:07,873
Naah, nothing so scary.

132
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:13,234
If you keep smiling, they'll soon leave the house.

133
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,039
They're probably deciding where to go next, right now.

134
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,832
Mei, they're going away.

135
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:27,830
That's no fun.

136
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:30,429
What happens if a huge one comes out, like this?

137
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,029
I wouldn't be scared.

138
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:36,115
Okay then, I won't walk you to the bathroom at night.

139
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:43,509
Okay, cleaning time. Could you get some water from the stream?

140
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,715
From the stream?

141
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:45,995
I'm coming, too!

142
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,318
Mei, wait there.

143
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,751
Did you get a fish?

144
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,231
Nanny, it's coming out!

145
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:21,231
Good, keep pumping 'til the water gets cold.

146
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,948
Okay!

147
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:08,038
May I help you?

148
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:12,039
Huh... my Mom... for Granny.

149
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,070
Yes?

150
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:23,038
Wait, what is it?

151
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,752
Is that you, Kanta?

152
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:32,793
You live in a haunted house!

153
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,115
Kanta, stop it!

154
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,200
I did the same when I was his age.

155
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:52,794
I hate boys. But I really love Nanny's rice cakes!

156
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,196
Eat as much as you want.

157
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,354
Thank you!

158
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,152
Thank you very much for your help.

159
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,790
Good bye!

160
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:23,352
Dad, the house is going to fall down.

161
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:28,553
I hope not; we've only just moved in.

162
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:07,030
Come on, let's laugh to keep the bogeymen away!

163
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,958
I'm not scared.

164
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,872
I mean it. I'm not scared!

165
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,036
One-two, one-two...

166
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:04,675
Come on, keep up the good work...

167
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,913
Okay! Washing... finished!

168
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,350
Here we go!

169
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,874
Nanny!

170
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,311
Hello!

171
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:48,158
Hard at work?

172
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:50,715
Where're you all heading?

173
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:54,074
To visit Mommy in the hospital!

174
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:58,950
That's nice. Give her my regards!

175
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:19,151
This way.

176
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:46,996
Hello.

177
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,713
Hello there.

178
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,276
Mommy!

179
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,874
So glad you came, my dear.

180
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,275
Daddy took the wrong road.

181
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:59,193
Really? Hello, Satsuki.

182
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,032
It's a school holiday today.

183
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,389
How nice.

184
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:05,319
Daddy is talking to the doctor.

185
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,391
It's so good to see you all.

186
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:10,360
Have you settled into the new house?

187
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,278
A haunted house?

188
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,915
Mom, do you like ghosts?

189
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:24,317
Of course I do! I can't wait to see them.

190
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:26,118
See, I told you Mei.

191
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:30,596
Mei was worried that you wouldn't like ghosts.

192
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:31,949
What about you two?

193
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:32,956
I love them!

194
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,952
I'm not scared of them!

195
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:40,039
Are you fixing Mei's hair, Satsuki?

196
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,555
It's really good. Lucky girl, Mei.

197
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:47,235
But she always gets mad at me.

198
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,998
That's 'cuz you won't stay still.

199
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:51,116
Come here, Satsuki.

200
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,432
Isn't yours too short?

201
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,755
No, I like it like this.

202
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,791
Do mine, Mommy! Mine, too!

203
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:57,796
Wait your turn!

204
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:03,389
Wavy hair, just like mine when I was your age.

205
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:07,434
Will it be like yours when I grow up?

206
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:11,349
Probably. You take after your Mom.

207
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:31,151
Mom looked really well.

208
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:35,154
You're right.The doctor says she'll be home soon.

209
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,478
Soon? Like tomorrow?

210
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,676
You always say this.

211
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,478
Tomorrow is a little too soon.

212
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,392
Mom said she'll sleep with me in my bed.

213
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:49,599
Weren't you saying you're big enough to sleep alone?

214
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,996
Mom is special!

215
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:16,950
Dad, time to get up!

216
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:23,234
Wake up!

217
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,278
Sorry, I overslept again...

218
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,311
I've got to bring a box lunch today.

219
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,471
I totally forgot about it.

220
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:37,515
It's all right. I've made something for all of us.

221
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:38,476
It's burning!

222
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,675
I'm coming.

223
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,636
Here, this is yours, Mei.

224
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,629
It's for me?

225
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,073
Mei, sit down and eat!

226
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,392
Here, wrap yours.

227
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,314
Satsuki!

228
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,635
Uh-oh.

229
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:03,593
I'm coming!

230
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,753
You made a friend already?

231
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,991
She's calling you!

232
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,072
Yup, that's Michiko.

233
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,919
Gotta go!

234
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:17,993
See ya!

235
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,396
See you later!

236
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,595
Morning!

237
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,990
Hi, let's go.

238
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,919
Daddy!

239
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,593
Do I look all grown up?

240
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,995
Yes dear. And where might you be going?

241
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,912
I'm just going out.

242
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,516
Daddy, is it lunch yet?

243
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,676
Already?

244
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:27,559
You be the flower shop, Daddy.

245
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,079
Pole-tads!

246
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,239
Got no bottom.

247
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:20,669
Gotcha!

248
00:33:57,520 --> 00:34:00,478
Who are you? A big soot gremlin?

249
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:31,672
To-to-ro? You're Totoro!

250
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,030
I bet you're Totoro.

251
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:51,677
See you!

252
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,069
Okay, catch you later!

253
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,196
I'm home!

254
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:59,079
Hey there. Is it that late already?

255
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,151
Where's Mei? I'm off to Michiko's.

256
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:04,710
We haven't eaten yet. Is Mei in the garden?

257
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,513
Mei!

258
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:25,754
Dad, I found her hat!

259
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:52,269
Wake up, Mei!

260
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,195
You shouldn't sleep here!

261
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,149
Where's Totoro?

262
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,429
Totoro?

263
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:03,274
Where?

264
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,318
Were you dreaming?

265
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,959
Totoro was here.

266
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:12,232
You mean that troll in your picture book?

267
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:19,431
Yeah. He was all hairy with a big mouth like this.

268
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:26,239
There's a tiny one and a little one and a huge one like this.

269
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:33,551
There you are. Wow, this is amazing.

270
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,753
A great hiding place!

271
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:39,271
Dad, Mei said she met a Totoro here.

272
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:40,469
A Totoro?

273
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:42,150
It's this way.

274
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:52,318
Hey, wait for me!

275
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,679
Huh?!

276
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:58,995
Here?

277
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,235
No.

278
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:03,195
It went to a big tree.

279
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:05,396
But there wasn't any other path.

280
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:08,474
Mei! Come back!

281
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:27,359
But it's true! Totoro was here.

282
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,068
I'm not lying.

283
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,429
I know, Mei.

284
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,633
I didn't lie.

285
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:47,073
Neither of us think you're lying.

286
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:53,072
You probably met the king of this forest. You were very lucky.

287
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:56,678
He doesn't come out very often.

288
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,390
We should pay our respects at the shrine.

289
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:01,430
Pay our respects?

290
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:03,358
To this forest.

291
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:22,758
Mei, you're getting heavy.

292
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,558
Daddy, look! That camphor tree!

293
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:26,995
What a big tree.

294
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,116
It's here!

295
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:38,669
Is that the tree?

296
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:42,148
Dad, hurry up.

297
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,956
The hole has gone.

298
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:56,354
Are you sure it was here?

299
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,071
The hole disappeared.

300
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:02,515
I told you he doesn't come to see us often.

301
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:05,434
But will he come again? I want to meet him, too.

302
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:09,113
If you're lucky, sure.

303
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:12,032
What a beautiful tree.

304
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:18,071
This tree must have stood here for years and years.

305
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:23,439
Trees and people used to be good friends.

306
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:31,358
I saw that tree and fell in love with the house. Hope Mom likes it, too.

307
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:34,671
Okay, let's pay our respects then get home for lunch.

308
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:37,348
Yes, I promised to go see Michiko.

309
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:38,919
I want to go, too!

310
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,435
Attention!

311
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:45,277
Thank you for looking after Mei.

312
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,590
Please take care of us.

313
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:49,395
Let's race home!

314
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:54,237
Wait!

315
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,397
Hurry up!

316
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,636
Wait for me!

317
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:04,633
Dear Mother, something amazing happened today.

318
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:08,471
Mei met a giant Totoro.

319
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:17,996
And I'm hoping to see him myself soon, too.

320
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:51,397
Kanta, hurry up! You'll be late!

321
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:36,315
Mei?

322
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:37,955
Excuse me!

323
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:39,633
Yes, Satsuki?

324
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:41,878
It's my sister...

325
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:50,678
What happened, Nanny?

326
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:55,511
I'm sorry. She insisted that she be with you.

327
00:42:56,040 --> 00:43:00,431
It's Dad's day at the university.

328
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:03,638
You promised to be a good girl at Nanny's.

329
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:10,713
I still have two more classes and Nanny's too busy for this...

330
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:16,149
She was good up 'til now, weren't you?

331
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:25,591
I'll go talk to my teacher.

332
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:38,996
Since Satsuki's mother is in the hospital, I want you all to be nice to her.

333
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:47,519
What's that?

334
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:48,954
It's Totoro.

335
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:52,518
Mei, you should keep quiet.

336
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:53,635
Okay.

337
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,594
Bye bye, Mei!

338
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,558
I can't stay after class today.

339
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:10,551
We'll let teacher know.

340
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:12,159
See you!

341
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:15,518
Hurry up, it's going to rain!

342
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:16,590
Okay.

343
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,153
Here it comes!

344
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:39,270
Here.

345
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:45,675
I won't cry. Aren't I good?

346
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:50,634
It's getting worse...

347
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:56,350
Dear Guardian Spirit, let us stay until the rain stops.

348
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:41,188
But...

349
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:03,710
That was lucky.

350
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:06,791
It's got holes in it.

351
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:20,875
Daddy forgot his umbrella.

352
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:22,798
I'm going, too.

353
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:27,838
I said I forgot it!

354
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:31,430
What idiot forgets his umbrella on a rainy day?

355
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:33,313
Ouch!

356
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:35,711
You broke it playing, I bet.

357
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:37,108
I did not!

358
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:51,834
Excuse me.

359
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:57,868
Hello Satsuki. Hi, Mei. Grandma!

360
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:00,679
I'm sorry about Mei today.

361
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:02,871
Not at all. Sorry we couldn't do more.

362
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:06,277
Kanta lent us this umbrella.

363
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:10,029
He did? A broken old thing like that!

364
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:12,750
Mei was with me, so I was glad.

365
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:16,515
But I'm so sorry that Kanta got wet.

366
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:21,516
Not at all. It probably cleaned him up a little.

367
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,274
Are you off to meet your father?

368
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:24,077
Yes.

369
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:25,833
What good girls you are.

370
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:28,271
Bye bye, Mei.

371
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:40,792
Who was that?

372
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:48,591
Just in time!

373
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:02,869
Getting on?

374
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:05,918
All right, drive on.

375
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:16,515
Daddy wasn't on it.

376
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:20,833
He'll be on the next one. Why don't you wait at Nanny's?

377
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:58,235
Are you okay?

378
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:32,995
Sleepy?

379
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:37,993
I told you. Wanna go to Nanny's?

380
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:41,916
It won't be much longer. Hang in there.

381
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:50,913
It's late...

382
00:49:58,520 --> 00:49:59,430
Come on.

383
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:24,070
Are you Totoro?

384
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:36,197
Wait a minute.

385
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:43,154
You can use this.

386
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:46,636
Take it, Mei's slipping off.

387
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:54,599
Hold it like this.

388
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:12,789
Here's the bus!

389
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:24,035
He took Daddy's umbrella...

390
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:38,509
I'm sorry.

391
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:39,755
All right, drive on.

392
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:43,632
The train was late and I missed the bus.

393
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:46,118
Were you worried?

394
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:48,836
We met him, Dad! He was here!

395
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:50,678
And the Cat Bus!

396
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:52,269
What?

397
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:54,192
It was huge!

398
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:58,273
With big eyes like these!

399
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:03,392
We met him! We met Totoro!

400
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:05,552
How wonderful!

401
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:18,429
Come on, Daddy.

402
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:30,308
Dear Mother, I can't tell you how excited I was today.

403
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:35,156
It was the scariest, funniest day I've ever had.

404
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:37,635
Totoro gave us a lovely present...

405
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:42,272
...wrapped in bamboo leaves and tied with dragon whiskers.

406
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:47,349
When we opened it, it was full of magic nuts and seeds!

407
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:58,230
We decided to plant them in the garden to make a lovely forest.

408
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:05,079
But they haven't sprouted yet. Mei sits there all day, waiting for them.

409
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:09,755
She looks like a little crab.

410
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:16,432
It's nearly summer vacation.

411
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:21,077
Dearest, dear Mom, get well soon. Love, Satsuki.

412
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:26,516
Come on. Bed time.

413
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:31,231
Lights off!

414
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:32,879
Wait, Dad.

415
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:36,153
Daddy, do you think they will sprout tomorrow?

416
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:41,434
Well, I'm sure Totoro would know. Night night.

417
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:31,675
Mei!

418
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:51,472
That's where we planted the seeds.

419
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:26,235
Wow, we did it!

420
01:00:41,720 --> 01:00:44,518
We're the wind!

421
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:46,958
There are no trees!

422
01:01:51,880 --> 01:01:53,711
Yessss!

423
01:01:56,840 --> 01:01:57,750
It was a dream.

424
01:01:57,960 --> 01:02:00,190
But it wasn't a dream.

425
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:04,792
We did it!

426
01:02:21,560 --> 01:02:26,873
Mr. Kusakabe! Telegram!

427
01:02:31,480 --> 01:02:33,072
Anyone home?

428
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:42,195
Nanny

429
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:47,719
I'm here.

430
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:51,671
This one is ripe.

431
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:02,479
What about this one?

432
01:03:02,680 --> 01:03:04,033
That's good, too.

433
01:03:10,280 --> 01:03:13,477
Your garden's a treasure house.

434
01:03:14,120 --> 01:03:16,554
Let's take a little break.

435
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:25,314
These should be cold now.

436
01:03:25,880 --> 01:03:27,359
Looks delicious.

437
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:38,039
So good.

438
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:44,036
The sun blessed these so they're really good for you.

439
01:03:44,560 --> 01:03:46,357
Would they help my Mom, too?

440
01:03:46,520 --> 01:03:51,435
Of course. If she eats my vegetables, she'll get better right away.

441
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:54,474
She's supposed to be back next Saturday.

442
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:56,676
She'll sleep in my bed!

443
01:03:57,400 --> 01:03:59,994
At last. That's wonderful.

444
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:06,639
But it's only for a couple of days. To get used to the new house.

445
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:11,193
I see. We'll feed her lots of vegetables, then.

446
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:14,836
I'll give her this corn I picked.

447
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:16,752
I'm sure she'll be very pleased.

448
01:04:17,360 --> 01:04:18,839
Yes!

449
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:28,516
There was a telegram for you.

450
01:04:28,760 --> 01:04:29,590
For us?

451
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,070
Dad won't be back till late, what shall I do?

452
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:39,029
Open it, it might be important.

453
01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:46,914
PLEASE CONTACT, HOSPITAL...

454
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:52,354
It's from Mom's hospital! Something's happened to her!

455
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:56,631
Nanny! What shall I do?

456
01:04:56,840 --> 01:05:00,799
Calm down. Do you know where your Dad is?

457
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:04,151
I know his office number, but we don't have a telephone.

458
01:05:04,360 --> 01:05:08,512
Kanta, take her to use the phone in the main house!

459
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:16,792
Mei, stay here with me!

460
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:27,751
Stay with Nanny, Mei!

461
01:06:05,160 --> 01:06:07,913
Hello, I'd like to make a long-distance call, please.

462
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:13,397
It's Tokyo 31-1382.

463
01:06:14,920 --> 01:06:18,037
A cute girl, Kanta.

464
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:22,915
Hello? Yes?

465
01:06:24,120 --> 01:06:29,069
Hello, may I speak to Dad... er... Mr. Kusakabe?

466
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,752
It's his daughter, Satsuki.

467
01:06:35,960 --> 01:06:37,837
Daddy? It‘s me, Satsuki!

468
01:06:38,040 --> 01:06:43,797
Hello, what's up? From the hospital?

469
01:06:44,040 --> 01:06:46,679
Okay, I'll call them right away.

470
01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:49,673
Is there anything wrong with Mom?

471
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:56,115
Don't worry. I'll check and call you right back.

472
01:06:57,840 --> 01:06:59,353
I'm hanging up now, stay there.

473
01:07:01,840 --> 01:07:05,310
May I stay here until he calls back?

474
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:08,036
Stay as long as you like.

475
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:17,590
Satsuki!

476
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:29,198
No, this corn is for my Mommy!

477
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:34,231
No, it's my Mom's!

478
01:07:50,360 --> 01:07:56,515
Listen Mei. Mom's not well so she's not coming home this time.

479
01:07:57,040 --> 01:07:58,234
No!

480
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:03,075
There's nothing we can do. You don't want her to get worse, do you?

481
01:08:03,360 --> 01:08:04,839
No!

482
01:08:06,080 --> 01:08:08,116
It's just for a few more days.

483
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:13,431
So you don't care if she dies, do you?

484
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:18,429
Stop being silly! I'm going.

485
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:30,475
Let's go, Mei.

486
01:08:34,120 --> 01:08:37,669
I hate you, Satsuki!

487
01:09:04,480 --> 01:09:08,268
We should bring the washing in...

488
01:09:08,800 --> 01:09:15,558
Don't worry too much, Satsuki. Nanny's here to help, so cheer up.

489
01:09:19,480 --> 01:09:23,553
Your Dad said he'll stop by the hospital to check on her.

490
01:09:24,280 --> 01:09:31,118
Besides, it's just a cold; she'll be back next week.

491
01:09:35,480 --> 01:09:39,155
They said it was just a cold...

492
01:09:40,160 --> 01:09:41,878
when she went into hospital.

493
01:09:43,480 --> 01:09:45,277
But what if she dies!

494
01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:47,278
Don't be silly, Satsuki.

495
01:09:48,120 --> 01:09:50,315
Maybe Mom will...

496
01:09:53,760 --> 01:10:00,677
Stop it. Nobody would leave two pretty little girls like you.

497
01:10:01,680 --> 01:10:05,275
There, there. Don't cry.

498
01:10:05,480 --> 01:10:10,315
I'll be here until Daddy comes back, okay?

499
01:10:52,200 --> 01:10:55,351
Mei!

500
01:10:59,720 --> 01:11:01,517
Mei!

501
01:11:04,440 --> 01:11:06,670
Mei!

502
01:11:09,560 --> 01:11:10,629
Did she come back?

503
01:11:10,840 --> 01:11:13,434
Wasn't she at the bus stop?

504
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:17,677
That's strange. Where has she gone?

505
01:11:18,360 --> 01:11:21,591
I was nasty to her, 'cause she was being silly...

506
01:11:22,120 --> 01:11:24,680
Maybe she's heading for the hospital!

507
01:11:24,920 --> 01:11:30,756
The hospital? It would take a grown-up three hours!

508
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:31,716
I'll go look!

509
01:11:33,280 --> 01:11:40,277
Kanta, hurry! Tell your dad that Mei is missing!

510
01:11:49,400 --> 01:11:52,153
Stupid Mei. Always getting lost.

511
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,195
Mei!

512
01:12:09,240 --> 01:12:11,276
Excuse me.

513
01:12:13,240 --> 01:12:17,438
Have you seen a little girl pass by? She's my sister.

514
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:23,118
No, I don't think so. I'm sure I would've noticed...

515
01:12:24,160 --> 01:12:25,832
Maybe she wasn't here.

516
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:47,271
Are you sure she came this way?

517
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:49,158
I don't know.

518
01:12:57,280 --> 01:12:59,396
Mei!

519
01:13:20,840 --> 01:13:22,592
Please, stop!

520
01:13:25,360 --> 01:13:26,349
Jerk! What are you doing?!

521
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:29,393
I'm looking for my sister. Have you seen a little girl?

522
01:13:30,440 --> 01:13:31,475
Your little sister?

523
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:35,435
She's four. I think she's heading to the hospital.

524
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:37,228
Did you see anyone?

525
01:13:37,400 --> 01:13:42,872
No. We just came from there... but we didn't see anyone.

526
01:13:44,040 --> 01:13:45,712
Thanks anyway.

527
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:48,438
Where have you come from?

528
01:13:48,680 --> 01:13:50,079
From Matsugo.

529
01:13:51,720 --> 01:13:53,392
Really?

530
01:13:54,760 --> 01:13:56,159
Good luck.

531
01:14:07,440 --> 01:14:08,953
Satsuki!

532
01:14:10,440 --> 01:14:12,635
Kanta!

533
01:14:13,480 --> 01:14:14,356
Find her?

534
01:14:14,520 --> 01:14:16,238
No. And you?

535
01:14:17,080 --> 01:14:21,392
Dad and the others are looking for her. I'll go to the hospital,

536
01:14:21,640 --> 01:14:23,198
you go back home.

537
01:14:23,440 --> 01:14:27,274
I guess she got lost on the way to the hospital.

538
01:14:27,640 --> 01:14:30,438
They found a sandal by the pond.

539
01:14:37,720 --> 01:14:40,553
We're not sure if it's hers or not!

540
01:14:57,720 --> 01:14:59,472
Did you find her?

541
01:15:30,760 --> 01:15:35,117
Dear Lord, please protect her and...

542
01:15:35,560 --> 01:15:37,790
It's too deep here, better search further away!

543
01:15:38,040 --> 01:15:40,110
Hey, are there any poles left?

544
01:15:48,920 --> 01:15:50,956
Grandma, Satsuki's here!

545
01:15:55,720 --> 01:15:57,472
Nanny!

546
01:15:58,560 --> 01:16:00,551
Look, is it hers?

547
01:16:09,720 --> 01:16:10,550
No, it isn't.

548
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:27,038
Thank heavens, I was sure it was hers.

549
01:16:27,240 --> 01:16:29,959
Hey, Nanny was jumping to conclusions.

550
01:16:30,160 --> 01:16:31,593
It's not hers!

551
01:16:31,800 --> 01:16:33,631
Where's she gone then?

552
01:16:33,800 --> 01:16:35,233
Let's start from scratch.

553
01:16:35,480 --> 01:16:36,913
We better hurry, it'll be dark soon.

554
01:16:37,120 --> 01:16:40,749
I really appreciate your help, everyone.

555
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:43,030
Don't worry. Could have been any of us.

556
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:13,997
Please, help me Totoro!

557
01:17:14,200 --> 01:17:19,991
Mei is lost. It'll be dark soon. I'm sure she's scared somewhere...

558
01:17:50,840 --> 01:17:51,955
Totoro!

559
01:17:53,960 --> 01:17:57,839
Mei is lost and we can't find her!

560
01:17:58,600 --> 01:18:03,879
She must be scared, please help me find her.

561
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:07,794
I don't know what to do...

562
01:19:06,440 --> 01:19:07,953
They can't see the bus.

563
01:19:55,720 --> 01:19:58,109
FOREST—SWAMP

564
01:19:58,320 --> 01:20:00,629
CEMETERY—SHRINE

565
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:02,711
MEI

566
01:20:19,720 --> 01:20:22,154
Mei!

567
01:20:31,800 --> 01:20:32,994
The trees are moving out of the way!

568
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:12,629
Satsuki!

569
01:21:27,360 --> 01:21:28,315
Mei!

570
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:33,989
You silly girl.

571
01:21:34,240 --> 01:21:36,151
I'm sorry.

572
01:21:38,640 --> 01:21:41,837
You wanted to take the corn to Mom?

573
01:21:49,800 --> 01:21:52,234
HOSPITAL

574
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:55,911
Will you take us to the hospital?

575
01:21:58,360 --> 01:21:59,918
Thank you so much.

576
01:22:09,040 --> 01:22:13,591
I'm sorry. They didn't need to send a telegram just for a cold.

577
01:22:13,960 --> 01:22:18,317
The girls must be worried. I'm sorry to upset them.

578
01:22:18,720 --> 01:22:21,188
They'll be fine. As long as you're okay.

579
01:22:21,440 --> 01:22:26,434
We've all learned to cope. This'll just postpone the enjoyment.

580
01:22:28,080 --> 01:22:31,516
They've put up with it so well.

581
01:22:31,800 --> 01:22:34,758
I'm especially sorry for Satsuki, she's been so patient.

582
01:22:35,960 --> 01:22:37,109
You're right.

583
01:22:37,840 --> 01:22:41,833
I'm going to spoil them for a while when I come home.

584
01:22:42,040 --> 01:22:42,870
Oh no!

585
01:22:50,360 --> 01:22:52,078
She's laughing!

586
01:22:52,320 --> 01:22:53,912
Looks like she's fine.

587
01:23:02,320 --> 01:23:05,232
I can't wait to get back on my feet.

588
01:23:07,120 --> 01:23:07,996
Look.

589
01:23:14,400 --> 01:23:15,992
Where did that come from?

590
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:18,830
What?

591
01:23:19,520 --> 01:23:22,910
I could swear I just saw Satsuki and Mei laughing up in that tree.

592
01:23:26,120 --> 01:23:27,997
Maybe they were too. Look.

593
01:23:28,960 --> 01:23:31,394
'For Mother'

594
01:23:34,240 --> 01:23:41,157
<i>Totoro, Totoro</i>

595
01:23:49,560 --> 01:23:53,189
<i>Who leaves the seeds</i>

596
01:23:53,360 --> 01:23:56,477

01:23:56,640 --> 01:23:59,916
<i>Follow them and you will see</i>

598
01:24:00,080 --> 01:24:04,437
<i>A treasure there</i>

599
01:24:04,640 --> 01:24:08,110
<i>Then plant the seeds</i>

600
01:24:08,280 --> 01:24:11,477
<i>And help them grow</i>

601
01:24:11,640 --> 01:24:14,871
<i>It may seem like a dream</i>

602
01:24:15,040 --> 01:24:18,828
<i>Things are not what they seem</i>

603
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,992

<i>Totoro</i>

607
01:24:30,240 --> 01:24:33,710
<i>Totoro, Totoro</i>

608
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:37,230
<i>Living in the forest trees</i>

609
01:24:37,400 --> 01:24:40,233
<i>For such a very, very long time</i>

610
01:24:40,400 --> 01:24:44,871
<i>There you'll be with Totoro, Totoro</i>

611
01:24:45,040 --> 01:24:48,510
<i>Totoro, Totoro</i>

612
01:24:48,680 --> 01:24:52,195
<i>You only see him when you're very young</i>

613
01:24:52,360 --> 01:24:56,751
<i>A magical adventure for you</i>

614
01:24:56,920 --> 01:25:00,629
<i>It's magic for you</i>

615
01:25:02,320 --> 01:25:05,915
<i>Rain tumbles down</i>

616
01:25:06,120 --> 01:25:09,112
<i>The bus is late</i>

617
01:25:09,280 --> 01:25:12,397
<i>Suddenly, a furry white giant</i>

618
01:25:12,560 --> 01:25:17,031
<i>Is by your side</i>

619
01:25:17,200 --> 01:25:20,795
<i>Don't be afraid</i>

620
01:25:20,960 --> 01:25:23,952
<i>Just open wide</i>

621
01:25:24,120 --> 01:25:27,795
<i>Your umbrella for him</i>

622
01:25:27,960 --> 01:25:31,316
<i>Watch him play in the rain</i>

623
01:25:31,560 --> 01:25:34,791
<i>Now begins a new adventure</i>

624
01:25:34,960 --> 01:25:37,918

<i>And on a moonlit night</i>

629
01:25:50,080 --> 01:25:52,833
<i>He plays a magic flute in the sky</i>

630
01:25:53,040 --> 01:25:54,951
<i>There you'll be with Totoro</i>

631
01:25:57,720 --> 01:26:01,076
<i>Totoro, Totoro</i>

632
01:26:01,200 --> 01:26:04,829
<i>You only see him when you're very young</i>

633
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:09,357
<i>A magical adventure for you</i>

634
01:26:09,480 --> 01:26:14,508
<i>It's magic for you</i>
