1
00:00:48,792 --> 00:00:51,125
When Mrs. McBing was in labour…

2
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:54,000
A pan appeared in the sky.

3
00:00:55,042 --> 00:00:58,208
It flied along Garden Street…

4
00:00:58,375 --> 00:01:04,750
Turned left, and stopped at the Beefball King.

5
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:06,958
Correction:

6
00:01:07,083 --> 00:01:10,042
It first arrived at the Market Building…

7
00:01:10,333 --> 00:01:13,292
Lingered a bit… Correction:

8
00:01:13,375 --> 00:01:18,458
It flied over the railway, turned right…

9
00:01:18,583 --> 00:01:23,792
And headed directly for the Bazaar.

10
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:25,708
It flied on…

11
00:01:25,875 --> 00:01:29,042
At last coming into the maternity ward.

12
00:01:29,208 --> 00:01:32,500
There, on the right hand side of Mrs. McBing.

13
00:01:32,792 --> 00:01:35,083
Correction: Left hand side.

14
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:37,708
The pan stayed.

15
00:01:38,167 --> 00:01:40,167
Mrs. McBing, convinced that this was a miracle,

16
00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:43,292
Made a wish…

17
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:47,167
Thinking of her soon-to-be-born son.

18
00:01:47,333 --> 00:01:50,458
Please make him a clever and smart boy!

19
00:01:50,708 --> 00:01:53,833
The pan didn't seem to hear her words.

20
00:01:53,958 --> 00:01:56,167
So Mrs. McBing amended her wish:

21
00:01:56,333 --> 00:01:58,875
Or make him a smart businessman?

22
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,542
Or maybe…

23
00:02:00,667 --> 00:02:02,542
Or make him really handsome.

24
00:02:02,708 --> 00:02:06,042
As handsome as Chow Yun Fat or Tony Leung!

25
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:12,042
The pan didn't respond.

26
00:02:12,167 --> 00:02:13,583
Mrs. McBing, in panic…

27
00:02:13,792 --> 00:02:17,667
Made a final amendment:

28
00:02:18,042 --> 00:02:21,708
Her boy needed not to be smart or handsome

29
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:24,917
As long as luck be with him!

30
00:02:25,958 --> 00:02:29,542
It's nice to depend on oneself…

31
00:02:29,667 --> 00:02:31,917
But luck is essential still.

32
00:02:32,167 --> 00:02:35,500
Of course Chow and Leung are lucky guys…

33
00:02:36,292 --> 00:02:38,875
But then they are smart too!

34
00:02:42,208 --> 00:02:44,542
Finally, the pan dropped to the floor…

35
00:02:44,708 --> 00:02:49,458
Mrs. McBing, believing her wish granted…

36
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:52,417
Thought that was magnificent!

37
00:02:52,583 --> 00:02:54,167
But what had the pan granted her?

38
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:57,375
A smart boy? A lucky boy?

39
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,417
Or a Chow look-alike?

40
00:03:00,667 --> 00:03:02,708
To commemorate this, Mrs. McBing…

41
00:03:03,208 --> 00:03:06,250
Decided to name her son McNificent.

42
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:09,750
No! It's better to be humble!

43
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:11,958
I'll name him McDull!

44
00:03:12,167 --> 00:03:13,292
Dear all…

45
00:03:13,458 --> 00:03:16,208
I am the boy, no more McNificent…

46
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:18,542
I'm McDull!

47
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:43,375
"My School"

48
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:45,083
Oh dear,

49
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:47,083
your calves have grown strong.

50
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:48,875
"I've been desperately…

51
00:04:49,042 --> 00:04:50,500
looking for a school!

52
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:52,667
Why not try the one…

53
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:54,667
at the Emporium?

54
00:04:54,792 --> 00:04:57,083
The Spring Flower Kindergarten?

55
00:04:57,292 --> 00:04:59,833
Yeah! The one at the junction…

56
00:05:00,042 --> 00:05:01,667
Right next to Silver City Food Mall.

57
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:03,833
The Spring Flower Kindergarten!

58
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,208
Only 10 minutes walk from the MTR Station!

59
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:11,625
Spring Flower Kindergarten, good environment…

60
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:14,208
With white teachers for English class!

61
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:16,125
White teachers for English class?

62
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:16,958
Yeah!

63
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:22,417
Spring Flower offers white teachers!

64
00:05:31,292 --> 00:05:35,958
"We are all happy children…"

65
00:05:36,042 --> 00:05:40,917
"We sing everyday!"

66
00:05:41,042 --> 00:05:45,625
"We learn as we grow…"

67
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:50,792
"We are the flowers of spring!"

68
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:54,083
This piggy kid in a rabbit outfit…

69
00:05:54,292 --> 00:05:58,625
Who doesn't look the least like Chow or Leung…

70
00:05:58,792 --> 00:06:01,167
That's me, McDull.

71
00:06:02,292 --> 00:06:04,000
This is my kindergarten.

72
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:06,542
The headmaster came from the countryside…

73
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,875
As a result, he speaks with an accent.

74
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:10,208
For many years…

75
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:12,875
I had difficulty hearing him.

76
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:17,833
- Tart!    - Tart!

77
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,583
- Duck dumpling!    - Duck dumpling!

78
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:29,792
- The 97 Rule…    - The 97 Rule…

79
00:06:29,958 --> 00:06:33,083
Shall be replaced by the 98 Rule!

80
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:38,792
Shall be replaced by the 98 Rule!

81
00:06:39,167 --> 00:06:40,667
Good, children!

82
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:43,208
We are sharing an important issue…

83
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:45,000
this morning:

84
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:48,417
Children, have you handed in the school fee?

85
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:50,792
Yes!

86
00:06:50,958 --> 00:06:54,375
Great! Now move to class.

87
00:06:57,875 --> 00:07:00,417
You might conclude that this is a shabby school.

88
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:03,125
But, for me and my mates…

89
00:07:03,708 --> 00:07:06,625
This is the most beautiful paradise!

90
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,000
…Also, there is Miss Chan.

91
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:12,833
Who adores us in her absent-minded way.

92
00:07:13,917 --> 00:07:16,083
Also, she is a Faye Wong wannabe.

93
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:18,708
Actually, Kelly Chan will do!

94
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:20,750
Roll call now.

95
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:22,708
- McMug!    - Present!

96
00:07:22,917 --> 00:07:24,375
- Fail!    - Present!

97
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,667
- Goosie!    - Present!

98
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:28,750
- Darby!    - Present!

99
00:07:28,917 --> 00:07:31,708
- May!    - Present!

100
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:33,750
- June!    - Present!

101
00:07:33,917 --> 00:07:36,667
- May!    - Present!

102
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:40,000
- McMug!    - Present!

103
00:07:40,167 --> 00:07:41,292
May!

104
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:43,417
Miss Chan, I've been called twice!

105
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:45,208
Oops!

106
00:07:45,917 --> 00:07:48,417
Good morning, sir!

107
00:07:49,292 --> 00:07:52,250
Good day, sir!

108
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:55,250
Back to roll call.

109
00:07:55,792 --> 00:07:57,583
- Fail!    - Present!

110
00:07:57,792 --> 00:07:58,958
- Fail!    - Present!

111
00:07:59,167 --> 00:08:01,333
- Darby!    - Present!

112
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:03,250
- May!    - Present!

113
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,500
- McMug!    - Present!

114
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,875
- Goosie!    - Present!

115
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:09,458
- Goosie!    - Present!

116
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:11,375
Have I missed anyone?

117
00:08:11,542 --> 00:08:13,458
McDull!

118
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:15,667
McDull!

119
00:08:16,667 --> 00:08:18,208
McDull!

120
00:08:18,708 --> 00:08:20,000
McDull!

121
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:22,167
Hey, I don't understand…

122
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:23,625
I keep feeling that…

123
00:08:23,792 --> 00:08:27,625
Someone is calling me.

124
00:08:28,583 --> 00:08:30,500
Don't think that I've been daydreaming.

125
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:33,667
I was contemplating something academic:

126
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:36,917
How does this universe work?

127
00:08:37,542 --> 00:08:39,833
I mean, I ate 6 oranges that morning…

128
00:08:40,042 --> 00:08:44,542
And my stomach wouldn't stop.

129
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:47,125
Then I ate 3 bananas this morning.

130
00:08:47,292 --> 00:08:50,375
Again my stomach wouldn't stop…

131
00:08:50,542 --> 00:08:52,958
It just wouldn't stop!

132
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:57,083
How are these two things related?

133
00:08:57,958 --> 00:09:00,500
There are so many things that I don't understand.

134
00:09:00,667 --> 00:09:02,292
But I am not afraid.

135
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,667
One day, when I finish kindergarten…

136
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:08,000
I shall move up…

137
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:09,750
And get my degree.

138
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:11,167
When I graduate from university, I know…

139
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,292
I shall understand everything!

140
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:14,583
And then …

141
00:09:15,125 --> 00:09:17,292
I will buy my mother a house!

142
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:24,125
Our headmaster runs a tea stand…

143
00:09:24,292 --> 00:09:27,375
Which we kids frequent after class.

144
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:30,125
- Fishball noodle, please.    - No noodle left.

145
00:09:30,417 --> 00:09:33,917
- Fishball rice noodle then.    - No fishball left.

146
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:37,792
- Chicken wing noodle then.    - No noodle left.

147
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:41,833
- How about fishball congee?    - No fishball left.

148
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,417
Nothing left today?

149
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:46,625
- How about beef noodle?    - No noodle left.

150
00:09:46,917 --> 00:09:47,958
Again?

151
00:09:48,167 --> 00:09:51,708
- Fried chicken wing with fishball…    - No fishball left.

152
00:09:51,917 --> 00:09:55,333
Hey, fishball and noodle are both gone…

153
00:09:55,542 --> 00:09:58,917
You can't combine them with other things.

154
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:02,125
Can't combine them?

155
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:04,917
- A bowl of fishball then.    - No fishball left.

156
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:06,667
- A bowl of noodle?    - No noodle left.

157
00:10:07,792 --> 00:10:08,708
By now…

158
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:11,250
you can probably tell how smart I am.

159
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,958
Nothing worried me, all things were fine.

160
00:10:14,292 --> 00:10:17,000
No fishball left? Let's get some noodle.

161
00:10:17,167 --> 00:10:20,042
Shoot, Dull!

162
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:25,625
Watching myself grow and grow…

163
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:27,625
Everyday…

164
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:29,292
I feel full of strength!

165
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:30,833
The world is beautiful!

166
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:36,750
There is a song Miss Chan loves…

167
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,375
Which I always want to learn…

168
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:41,667
But it just comes out different.

169
00:10:41,792 --> 00:10:44,375
You mean "All Things Bright and Beautiful"?

170
00:10:44,542 --> 00:10:46,375
Yes, all are fine!

171
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:47,708
All things on earth…

172
00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:50,375
They are fine!!

173
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:45,375
"My Mother"

174
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:56,500
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7…

175
00:11:56,625 --> 00:11:57,792
No pain no gain!

176
00:11:57,958 --> 00:12:01,417
Monday till Sunday… No pain no gain!

177
00:12:01,792 --> 00:12:03,750
The middle-aged swine is Mrs. McBing,

178
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:05,750
my mother…

179
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:07,500
A brilliant woman…

180
00:12:07,708 --> 00:12:09,833
carrying the world!

181
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:08,875
Yes, she is really something.

182
00:13:09,042 --> 00:13:11,792
She works in insurance, real estate and trading.

183
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:15,333
At the height of IT, she even sets up her cooking site…

184
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:19,500
www.MrsMcBing.com

185
00:13:20,042 --> 00:13:22,292
Offering brilliant dishes.

186
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:25,500
Welcome to "Mrs. Mc Can Cook."

187
00:13:26,042 --> 00:13:27,542
Today we're doing a simple dish,

188
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:31,125
Paper Chicken.

189
00:13:31,292 --> 00:13:33,625
Kids at home would love it.

190
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:37,208
The ingredient: a chicken bun.

191
00:13:37,708 --> 00:13:42,750
Slowly, we tear the paper away from the bun.

192
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:45,708
Now we have a bun paper.

193
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:49,375
Turn the paper over like this…

194
00:13:49,792 --> 00:13:54,667
Voila! Simple, isn't it?

195
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:56,792
Thank you, everyone!

196
00:14:04,667 --> 00:14:07,083
How time flies since last episode!

197
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:10,708
Now we shall do a Paper Bun.

198
00:14:11,292 --> 00:14:14,667
The ingredient takes only a paper.

199
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:19,333
Do it like this…

200
00:14:20,042 --> 00:14:22,917
And we have a Paper Bun.

201
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:26,708
Isn't this a lovely bun?

202
00:14:33,292 --> 00:14:37,375
A novelty today for everyone:

203
00:14:37,542 --> 00:14:40,958
Chicken Bun Paper Bunning a Bun.

204
00:14:41,125 --> 00:14:45,042
First, unwrap the chicken from the paper.

205
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:49,708
Now we have a paper and a piece of chicken.

206
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:54,458
Use the bun paper to wrap up the chicken like this…

207
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:59,458
And then wrap it like this…

208
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:05,292

209
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:06,958
Such a simple dish!

210
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:09,250
See if the chicken is good!

211
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:17,875
Kids are bound to love…

212
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:19,458
today's dish…

213
00:15:19,917 --> 00:15:24,375
Bunning a Chicken Bun Paper…

214
00:15:24,542 --> 00:15:27,667
Bunning the Paper Chicken.

215
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,583
It takes simple work.

216
00:15:31,792 --> 00:15:34,958
Use the chicken bun to bun…

217
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:36,667
the chicken bun…

218
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:38,542
Then use the chicken bun paper to…

219
00:15:38,708 --> 00:15:41,708
bun and bun…

220
00:15:41,917 --> 00:15:46,250
Paper, bun, bun, paper, bun…

221
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:52,542
Paper, chicken, bun, bun, chicken…

222
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:57,750
But my mother has her tender side.

223
00:15:57,917 --> 00:16:01,083
Every night, she tells me a story before sleep.

224
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:05,792
Once upon a time, a boy lied. One day…

225
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,833
He died.

226
00:16:10,667 --> 00:16:13,792
Once upon a time, a boy studied hard.

227
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:16,583
He grew up and got rich.

228
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:21,708
Once upon a time, a boy was naughty. One day…

229
00:16:21,833 --> 00:16:23,417
He twisted his ankle.

230
00:16:23,542 --> 00:16:26,208
Mother, I want to sleep.

231
00:16:30,167 --> 00:16:34,625
Once upon a time, a boy slept a lot. Next day…

232
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:36,625
He died.

233
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:41,167
That is my mother's direct approach.

234
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,167
Her love for me is direct.

235
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:44,875
Her expectation of me is direct.

236
00:16:45,417 --> 00:16:46,875
For her, it is always…

237
00:16:47,042 --> 00:16:48,500
"no pain no gain".

238
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:11,500
But there are things that simply cannot be gained.

239
00:17:13,042 --> 00:17:14,792
Days come and go.

240
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,917
Talking about Chow look-alike…

241
00:17:17,167 --> 00:17:18,875
You still think it's going to happen?

242
00:17:19,917 --> 00:17:20,875
When it comes to luck…

243
00:17:21,042 --> 00:17:23,750
The lottery numbers that mother obliges to draw…

244
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:27,875
Failed even to bring her one cent!

245
00:17:30,167 --> 00:17:31,458
As for being smart…

246
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:36,542
I did try hard, but then…

247
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:40,625
But then, I still have dreams.

248
00:17:41,208 --> 00:17:44,250
"My Ideal World"

249
00:17:44,292 --> 00:17:49,417
Maldives, a world outside our world.

250
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:56,375
The sky blue, clouds white, the trees tall and water bright.

251
00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:00,875
The colourful world of the tropical sea.

252
00:18:01,042 --> 00:18:07,292
The primitive ocean of primitive energy.

253
00:18:07,458 --> 00:18:09,792
Experience a world that knows no boundary!

254
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:13,333
Enjoy a trip to your ideal world.

255
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:20,250
Brilliant Touring Agency, license no. 350999

256
00:18:22,792 --> 00:18:25,625
Mother, you know where Maldives is?

257
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:27,417
Far.

258
00:18:27,625 --> 00:18:28,708
How far?

259
00:18:28,917 --> 00:18:30,375
You need to fly there.

260
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:33,458
Mother will you take me there?

261
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:37,500
One day when I am rich.

262
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:40,125
When will you get rich?

263
00:18:41,875 --> 00:18:43,250
Soon…

264
00:18:43,417 --> 00:18:44,792
In my dream!

265
00:19:21,167 --> 00:19:23,833
Good morning, sir!

266
00:19:24,667 --> 00:19:28,000
Good day, sir!

267
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:32,083
Where is your favourite place?

268
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:35,708
My favourite place is Japan.

269
00:19:36,042 --> 00:19:39,208
They have Disneyland and Hello Kitty Land.

270
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:43,583
I bought my hairpin there.

271
00:19:44,167 --> 00:19:47,083
My favourite place is Canada.

272
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:50,375
Grandma and my uncles live there.

273
00:19:50,958 --> 00:19:53,625
My favourite place is Bangkok.

274
00:19:53,792 --> 00:19:57,917
They have water sports and shark's fin soup.

275
00:19:58,458 --> 00:20:01,292
My favourite place is that…

276
00:20:01,417 --> 00:20:03,000
What's-its-name.

277
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:06,667
They have Fun World and Food Mall.

278
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:09,917
Their chicken rice fills you up.

279
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:13,250
Right, that's Silver City Centre.

280
00:20:13,417 --> 00:20:17,250
They serve huge bowls of rice.

281
00:20:18,458 --> 00:20:22,875
As for the place I most want to go, wow!

282
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,917
There, the sky is blue, clouds white, the trees tall…

283
00:20:28,042 --> 00:20:32,292
It is a world outside our world.

284
00:22:10,583 --> 00:22:13,458
Rise and shine, kiddo.

285
00:22:13,667 --> 00:22:14,667
Oh?

286
00:22:14,792 --> 00:22:16,958
Mother!

287
00:22:24,042 --> 00:22:26,125
Take some medicine and he'll be fine.

288
00:22:26,542 --> 00:22:29,250
Will he not what after the medicine?

289
00:22:29,292 --> 00:22:30,625
No!

290
00:22:30,792 --> 00:22:32,125
Need he not what for the medicine?

291
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:33,875
No! I'll give him a shot.

292
00:22:34,292 --> 00:22:36,333
A shot?

293
00:22:36,458 --> 00:22:38,917
He's scared of shots.

294
00:22:40,875 --> 00:22:43,167
Is he scared of dying?

295
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:41,958
How are you doing? Take the medicine.

296
00:23:42,125 --> 00:23:45,125
Mother, I don't want medicine.

297
00:23:45,292 --> 00:23:47,917
Please mother, no.

298
00:23:48,042 --> 00:23:50,458
I don't want the strawberry drink!

299
00:23:50,625 --> 00:23:53,583
You won't get well without the medicine.

300
00:23:53,708 --> 00:23:56,917
Sweetie, we will go to Maldives once you get well.

301
00:23:57,542 --> 00:23:58,708
Really?

302
00:23:58,833 --> 00:24:00,625
Has mother ever lied before?

303
00:24:01,125 --> 00:24:03,542
Now, drink up.

304
00:24:09,458 --> 00:24:11,875
Yes, Maldives!

305
00:24:12,292 --> 00:24:13,250
Maldives!

306
00:24:13,458 --> 00:24:14,417
Maldives!

307
00:24:14,542 --> 00:24:15,792
Maldives!

308
00:24:16,333 --> 00:24:19,083
Mother, when will we go?

309
00:24:19,792 --> 00:24:25,042
I will book the ticket once you get well.

310
00:24:26,125 --> 00:24:28,000
Come on, drink up!

311
00:24:45,917 --> 00:24:47,917
Look, mother!

312
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:53,708
Mother, I am well!

313
00:24:53,958 --> 00:24:56,000
I've taken all the medicine.

314
00:24:56,167 --> 00:24:58,667
But you've taken everything edible at home.

315
00:24:58,833 --> 00:25:02,417
You see, the whole bottle was filled…

316
00:25:02,583 --> 00:25:05,750
And I gulped it down bit by bit…

317
00:25:06,042 --> 00:25:08,333
I did it!

318
00:25:14,083 --> 00:25:15,667
Now I am a good boy!

319
00:25:15,833 --> 00:25:18,167
Now I am not sick!

320
00:25:18,292 --> 00:25:19,167
Mother…

321
00:25:19,333 --> 00:25:20,375
What?

322
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,917
When are we going to Maldives?

323
00:25:23,083 --> 00:25:24,750
Maldives?

324
00:25:24,958 --> 00:25:28,417
You said we would go once I got well.

325
00:25:28,583 --> 00:25:31,958
Maldives, where the trees tall and water bright…

326
00:25:32,083 --> 00:25:35,167
The world outside our world!

327
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:38,667
Those words have flair.

328
00:25:38,833 --> 00:25:40,125
I am happy for you.

329
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:45,250
Mother, you promised…

330
00:25:45,458 --> 00:25:50,417
We'd go to Maldives once I got well.

331
00:25:50,583 --> 00:25:53,500
I meant once I get rich.

332
00:25:54,417 --> 00:25:58,708
No, that wasn't what you meant.

333
00:26:01,625 --> 00:26:06,083
You said we'd go once I got well.

334
00:26:07,042 --> 00:26:09,125
You promised!

335
00:26:09,958 --> 00:26:12,000
Now stop crying.

336
00:26:12,167 --> 00:26:13,708
We will go to Maldives.

337
00:26:13,875 --> 00:26:15,542
- Really?    - Yes.

338
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:17,000
When?

339
00:26:17,167 --> 00:26:18,542
Once I get rich.

340
00:26:18,708 --> 00:26:20,167
But you are rich.

341
00:26:20,333 --> 00:26:22,042
Sure, sure, I am rich.

342
00:26:22,208 --> 00:26:23,500
We will go next week, ok?

343
00:26:23,625 --> 00:26:24,542
Bravo!

344
00:27:00,333 --> 00:27:03,917
This is McDull.

345
00:27:04,042 --> 00:27:06,167
Hey, I'm leaving tomorrow.

346
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:08,667
- Yes…    - Is that right?

347
00:27:08,833 --> 00:27:10,292
The food on board is horrible?

348
00:27:10,417 --> 00:27:12,167
Be it so!

349
00:27:12,333 --> 00:27:14,417
We couldn't bring our own food, right?

350
00:27:14,542 --> 00:27:15,542
Still chatting away?

351
00:27:15,708 --> 00:27:18,208
You need to pack.

352
00:27:18,375 --> 00:27:22,625
Tell them I'm going to Maldives tomorrow.

353
00:27:22,833 --> 00:27:26,708
Where the trees tall and water bright…

354
00:27:26,833 --> 00:27:27,917
Hey, you!

355
00:27:28,042 --> 00:27:29,500
Coming!

356
00:27:30,125 --> 00:27:33,417
I need to pack now. Talk to you later.

357
00:27:33,583 --> 00:27:35,125
See you!

358
00:27:44,667 --> 00:27:48,458
Mother, do I need to bring my birth certificate?

359
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:49,458
I guess so.

360
00:27:49,583 --> 00:27:50,542
And school report?

361
00:27:50,667 --> 00:27:51,917
We don't need that.

362
00:27:52,083 --> 00:27:55,292
Wow, I'm saved!

363
00:28:05,292 --> 00:28:06,875
I found it!

364
00:28:07,042 --> 00:28:09,583
I found my birth certificate!

365
00:28:12,375 --> 00:28:20,917
Mother, you keep it and don't lose it…

366
00:28:21,083 --> 00:28:23,500
Or else we're stuck.

367
00:32:22,167 --> 00:32:24,875
Leave on the morning, return at night.

368
00:32:25,083 --> 00:32:27,292
Mother said that'd make things worthy.

369
00:32:27,417 --> 00:32:28,583
Hence…

370
00:32:28,917 --> 00:32:30,875
The most beautiful day in my childhood experience…

371
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,875
Passed.

372
00:32:33,417 --> 00:32:35,958
Do you think paper is a good chicken wrapper?

373
00:32:36,542 --> 00:32:37,875
Maybe.

374
00:32:38,583 --> 00:32:41,000
If only for one small piece.

375
00:33:06,042 --> 00:33:08,250
- Goodnight, mother!    - Goodnight!

376
00:33:46,542 --> 00:33:48,000
The Hong Kong…

377
00:33:48,125 --> 00:33:52,292
windsurfing athlete San San Li…

378
00:33:52,458 --> 00:33:55,667
Has just won the first gold medal in Hong Kong history!

379
00:33:55,833 --> 00:33:59,708
San San, when confirmed her winning…

380
00:33:59,833 --> 00:34:03,875
Told reporters that her result…

381
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,667
Helps prove that Hong Kong athletes are horrible…

382
00:34:09,292 --> 00:34:13,708
Excuse me, it should be "honourable".

383
00:34:13,875 --> 00:34:18,875
Hong Kong athletes are honourable athletes.

384
00:34:19,042 --> 00:34:21,000
End of special report.

385
00:34:25,042 --> 00:34:27,208
Then, mother seemed inspired.

386
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,500
Handsome, lucky, smart…

387
00:34:30,625 --> 00:34:32,458
So much for those plans.

388
00:34:32,958 --> 00:34:35,458
Now how about something physical?

389
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:36,917
"Looking for Logan"

390
00:34:36,958 --> 00:34:38,333
And so, while one dream lingers on…

391
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:40,667
Another one begins.

392
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,417
"aka: How Does a Calf Become a Calf?"

393
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:45,417
It's about the Calf!

394
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:47,583
I know it is not easy.

395
00:34:48,875 --> 00:34:51,583
I know it is not easy to find Logan.

396
00:34:52,875 --> 00:34:56,417
I know it is not easy for him to take me in.

397
00:34:59,708 --> 00:35:03,250
No matter how difficult this is…

398
00:35:03,417 --> 00:35:05,500
Logan will be my master!

399
00:35:05,833 --> 00:35:09,875
I shall get an Olympic medal!

400
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:26,250
Cheung Chau!

401
00:35:26,792 --> 00:35:31,250
You raised San San, now you will raise me!

402
00:35:31,542 --> 00:35:34,542
When I receive my Olympic medal…

403
00:35:34,792 --> 00:35:38,375
I shall tell the world:

404
00:35:38,542 --> 00:35:42,083
HK athletes are honourable athletes!

405
00:35:49,792 --> 00:35:53,417
Cheung Chau, I finally make it here.

406
00:35:58,333 --> 00:36:05,583
I must kiss this holy land!

407
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:13,667
Kiddo, this is Lamma Island.

408
00:36:14,667 --> 00:36:19,542
Lamma Island? Where Chow Yun Fat grew up?

409
00:36:29,708 --> 00:36:34,500
I came into hiding on this island…

410
00:36:35,292 --> 00:36:39,500
To stay away from the paparazzi.

411
00:36:39,667 --> 00:36:45,083
And so many kids came to seek me out.

412
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:47,833
So I came to live here.

413
00:36:48,208 --> 00:36:50,083
You want me to be your master?

414
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:51,917
Forget it!

415
00:36:52,250 --> 00:36:55,750
You city kids are all spoiled…

416
00:36:55,875 --> 00:36:57,708
Good for nothing!

417
00:36:57,833 --> 00:37:00,000
You want to get an Olympic medal too?

418
00:37:00,083 --> 00:37:02,000
Dream on!

419
00:37:05,333 --> 00:37:09,000
Kiddo, look!

420
00:37:15,375 --> 00:37:16,167
This calf…

421
00:37:16,333 --> 00:37:21,292
So thick, so strong!

422
00:37:21,417 --> 00:37:23,667
And so muscular!

423
00:37:23,875 --> 00:37:27,167
With steely veins running down…

424
00:37:27,625 --> 00:37:30,833
Hair sticking out like wire…

425
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:35,042
And those tough toenails!

426
00:37:35,208 --> 00:37:36,667
How many hills must it travel…

427
00:37:36,833 --> 00:37:38,208
How many seas must it pass…

428
00:37:38,375 --> 00:37:39,792
How much pain must it bear…

429
00:37:39,917 --> 00:37:44,875
Before a calf becomes a calf?

430
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:51,583
I shall have this calf!

431
00:37:51,875 --> 00:37:52,917
Master!

432
00:37:57,125 --> 00:37:59,667
Can I take a pee?

433
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:07,250
Whenever I sing this song, I need to pee.

434
00:38:07,875 --> 00:38:11,375
Taking a pee first would not help.

435
00:38:11,875 --> 00:38:14,542
But I must sing it now.

436
00:38:14,708 --> 00:38:17,708
With this song, I hope…

437
00:38:18,125 --> 00:38:20,333
Logan will think better of me.

438
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:22,958
Logan will be my master!

439
00:38:23,125 --> 00:38:25,917
The song goes like this…

440
00:38:26,042 --> 00:38:27,542
"Big bun, have two more…"

441
00:38:27,667 --> 00:38:29,417
"Big bun, have two more…"

442
00:38:29,542 --> 00:38:33,250
"Forget about indigestion."

443
00:38:33,375 --> 00:38:35,083
"Big bun, have two more…"

444
00:38:35,208 --> 00:38:36,875
"Big bun, have two more…"

445
00:38:37,042 --> 00:38:40,667
"Forget about indigestion."

446
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,583
"Big bun, have two more…"

447
00:38:42,708 --> 00:38:44,500
"Big bun, have two more…"

448
00:38:44,667 --> 00:38:48,875
"Forget about indigestion."

449
00:38:49,167 --> 00:38:54,333
"Eat the bun, grow a calf…"

450
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:57,542
"Respect my mother."

451
00:38:58,375 --> 00:39:03,750
"Eat the bun, toughen my calf…"

452
00:39:03,917 --> 00:39:07,333
"Serve my country."

453
00:39:08,458 --> 00:39:10,000
"Big bun, have two more…"

454
00:39:10,125 --> 00:39:11,875
"Big bun, have two more…"

455
00:39:12,042 --> 00:39:15,500
"Forget about indigestion."

456
00:39:15,708 --> 00:39:17,667
"Big bun, have two more…"

457
00:39:17,792 --> 00:39:19,458
"Big bun, have two more…"

458
00:39:19,625 --> 00:39:24,792
"Forget about indigestion."

459
00:39:28,583 --> 00:39:32,875
Logan looks strange after the song.

460
00:39:33,542 --> 00:39:36,958
I must grab my chance.

461
00:39:37,417 --> 00:39:39,833
Master! Please be my master!

462
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,750
Or let me kneel here forever!

463
00:39:43,875 --> 00:39:46,042
Get up…

464
00:39:46,167 --> 00:39:47,250
Thank you master!

465
00:39:47,417 --> 00:39:50,167
Silly, help me get up.

466
00:39:50,333 --> 00:39:57,875
My calf has gone numb!

467
00:40:07,833 --> 00:40:10,917
I tell mother what happened today.

468
00:40:11,625 --> 00:40:14,333
She won't say a word…

469
00:40:14,458 --> 00:40:18,250
But starts to defreeze a chicken.

470
00:40:20,667 --> 00:40:24,500
At dinner, mother offers 3 glasses of wine…

471
00:40:24,833 --> 00:40:30,333
Oranges and the chicken to the ancestral tablet.

472
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:34,250
Mother then tells me to kneel down.

473
00:40:34,667 --> 00:40:38,458
She mumbles something when…

474
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:44,292
We pay our respect to our ancestors.

475
00:40:45,708 --> 00:40:49,875
As mother pours the wine on the floor…

476
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,750
She says in her solemn, tender voice:

477
00:40:52,875 --> 00:40:54,750
Be good,

478
00:40:55,208 --> 00:40:58,667
learn with the master and honour the ancestors.

479
00:41:05,625 --> 00:41:10,083
In honour of my master, mother throws a banquet.

480
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,583
As I am the last disciple of the master…

481
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:18,125
Everyone on Cheung Chau comes.

482
00:41:18,792 --> 00:41:21,333
San San's lover thinks…

483
00:41:21,542 --> 00:41:24,083
I have a nice thick back.

484
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:28,292
San San is in training and couldn't come.

485
00:41:28,458 --> 00:41:31,333
All my mates are there too…

486
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:35,292
Bringing school report, medals and big buns.

487
00:41:35,708 --> 00:41:39,875
They hope Logan will take them in also.

488
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,542
After the soup, the ceremony begins.

489
00:41:44,708 --> 00:41:49,292
Mother pours a cup of tea and I offer it to the master.

490
00:41:49,458 --> 00:41:53,125
After all the hardship looking for Logan…

491
00:41:53,250 --> 00:41:58,208
Now I can windsurf together with San San!

492
00:42:00,958 --> 00:42:04,458
I offer the tea to Logan…

493
00:42:05,167 --> 00:42:10,292
He drinks the tea and becomes my master.

494
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,917
All the guests look happy.

495
00:42:13,042 --> 00:42:17,833
And everyone from Cheung Chau applauds.

496
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:21,833
Thank you for honouring me!

497
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,875
In my life, I have two skills that I'm proud of.

498
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,958
One is windsurfing.

499
00:42:29,083 --> 00:42:32,875
That I have passed onto San San.

500
00:42:33,042 --> 00:42:37,708
The other, I shall pass onto my new disciple…

501
00:42:37,875 --> 00:42:41,958
Let him show the world…

502
00:42:42,083 --> 00:42:44,458
what a marvelous skill that is!

503
00:42:46,292 --> 00:42:48,583
Can you tell us what skill is that?

504
00:42:55,958 --> 00:42:59,083
That is…

505
00:42:59,542 --> 00:43:02,333
Bun snatching!

506
00:43:08,792 --> 00:43:10,750
Bun snatching?

507
00:43:12,292 --> 00:43:15,542
"Bun Snatching", for our uninformed audience…

508
00:43:16,292 --> 00:43:19,833
Is a unique Cheung Chau tradition.

509
00:43:20,625 --> 00:43:22,167
Each year, in the fourth month,

510
00:43:22,333 --> 00:43:25,125
Cheung Chau people…

511
00:43:25,958 --> 00:43:28,667
Set up 3 stacks of bun to celebrate.

512
00:43:29,750 --> 00:43:31,333
Stacks of bun?

513
00:43:31,792 --> 00:43:32,875
Literally speaking…

514
00:43:33,083 --> 00:43:38,375
A stack of bun is a stack of many buns!

515
00:43:38,750 --> 00:43:41,958
Each stack coming up to 6, 7 storeys.

516
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:46,208
Imagine how high that is.

517
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:51,875
Bun snatching is to snatch those buns!

518
00:43:52,542 --> 00:43:53,917
When the time comes,

519
00:43:54,125 --> 00:43:58,167
hundreds of youth would rush up…

520
00:43:58,292 --> 00:44:02,292
The higher the bun you snatch, the more blessed you are.

521
00:44:02,417 --> 00:44:05,833
And the more praise you get.

522
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:11,792
In 1978, 2 stacks tumbled down, hurting many.

523
00:44:11,958 --> 00:44:14,417
"Bun Snatching" was thus banned!

524
00:44:14,583 --> 00:44:18,583
And the unique tradition is lost.

525
00:44:22,167 --> 00:44:26,125
The Olympic medal… it has slipped away.

526
00:44:26,833 --> 00:44:30,250
Every Saturday, I'd take a ferry to Cheung Chau…

527
00:44:30,583 --> 00:44:32,375
to practice bun snatching.

528
00:44:32,583 --> 00:44:36,125
A game with no medal, no competitor, no competition…

529
00:44:36,542 --> 00:44:39,958
A game nobody knows of.

530
00:44:41,292 --> 00:44:44,583
A game with no bun to snatch!

531
00:44:45,583 --> 00:44:48,208
All I do is to go to the master's home…

532
00:44:48,417 --> 00:44:51,000
and crawl around the shelf.

533
00:44:52,375 --> 00:44:55,417
My win!

534
00:44:55,583 --> 00:44:58,208
Keep going, lazy bone!

535
00:45:00,833 --> 00:45:04,250
One day, San San arrives!

536
00:45:04,375 --> 00:45:06,875
San San, my idol!

537
00:45:07,042 --> 00:45:08,333
Seeing San San…

538
00:45:08,458 --> 00:45:11,583
Makes me forget all these weeks' hard work.

539
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:13,792
San San!

540
00:45:13,958 --> 00:45:16,125
San yourself! Work!

541
00:45:24,083 --> 00:45:25,375
You hear me?

542
00:45:26,417 --> 00:45:29,333
So San San leaves without seeing me.

543
00:45:29,667 --> 00:45:33,667
In despair, I crawl up the shelf.

544
00:45:35,167 --> 00:45:39,458
I have had a lot of things said to me…

545
00:45:39,708 --> 00:45:40,708
but "San yourself"…

546
00:45:40,792 --> 00:45:43,833
hurts like never before.

547
00:45:43,958 --> 00:45:45,333
I… I…

548
00:45:45,417 --> 00:45:48,083
I am quitting!

549
00:46:10,708 --> 00:46:15,083
Today is the first time I sit down with Logan.

550
00:46:15,750 --> 00:46:18,083
He must be around 50,

551
00:46:18,208 --> 00:46:20,208
with a baby face.

552
00:46:20,333 --> 00:46:22,208
Fresh from the oven!

553
00:46:25,667 --> 00:46:27,750
This thing…

554
00:46:28,333 --> 00:46:31,167
What does it look like?

555
00:46:36,917 --> 00:46:39,500
Dull… he's not a bad student.

556
00:46:39,667 --> 00:46:42,125
Logan then proceeds to tell me a lot…

557
00:46:42,583 --> 00:46:46,208
His ambition, his expectation of Dull.

558
00:46:46,583 --> 00:46:51,125
He says he'll teach all he knows to Dull.

559
00:46:51,708 --> 00:46:53,708
The more he talks, the more excited he gets.

560
00:46:53,792 --> 00:46:57,167
He tells me windsurfing is not his strongest.

561
00:46:57,417 --> 00:47:00,250
His strongest is really bun snatching…

562
00:47:00,833 --> 00:47:03,625
Something combining Fist,

563
00:47:03,750 --> 00:47:06,458
ritual and gymnastic.

564
00:47:06,750 --> 00:47:11,500
He says bun snatching is his lifelong achievement.

565
00:47:11,625 --> 00:47:13,542
Move your feet!

566
00:47:15,625 --> 00:47:17,333
Look!

567
00:47:18,875 --> 00:47:24,542
This calf… so thick, so strong!

568
00:47:24,708 --> 00:47:26,667
And so muscular!

569
00:47:26,833 --> 00:47:30,125
With steely veins running down…

570
00:47:30,708 --> 00:47:33,875
Hair sticking out like wire…

571
00:47:34,042 --> 00:47:37,875
And those tough toenails!

572
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,667
How many hills must it travel…

573
00:47:39,792 --> 00:47:41,625
How many seas must it pass…

574
00:47:41,750 --> 00:47:43,125
How much pain must it bear…

575
00:47:43,208 --> 00:47:47,500
Before a calf becomes a calf?

576
00:47:53,292 --> 00:47:54,000
My son…

577
00:47:54,125 --> 00:47:57,750
Your son, he will get this calf.

578
00:47:58,042 --> 00:48:01,583
I have no idea why would Dull need…

579
00:48:01,708 --> 00:48:02,958
such a calf.

580
00:48:03,125 --> 00:48:07,542
But, looking at those steely veins…

581
00:48:08,042 --> 00:48:12,542
I am reminded of Dull's pa, Bing.

582
00:48:21,042 --> 00:48:26,375
The electronic dictionary cannot be found.

583
00:48:26,542 --> 00:48:28,000
Where could it be?

584
00:48:28,125 --> 00:48:31,792
Could it be that… ?

585
00:48:36,750 --> 00:48:40,875
So mother has been using the dictionary?

586
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,958
But why is she writing in English?

587
00:48:44,417 --> 00:48:45,583
The letter is short.

588
00:48:45,708 --> 00:48:52,042
Mother must have translated it word by word.

589
00:48:52,167 --> 00:48:57,125
I use the machine to turn it back into Chinese.

590
00:48:58,083 --> 00:49:03,000
It is addressed to the Olympic Committee Chairman.

591
00:49:04,667 --> 00:49:06,083
"Dear Chairman:"

592
00:49:06,250 --> 00:49:08,500
"How are you? I am fine."

593
00:49:08,667 --> 00:49:10,917
"You like bun? I like bun!"

594
00:49:11,083 --> 00:49:15,292
"We Hong Kong people here love bun."

595
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:19,917
"Buns of all sorts."

596
00:49:20,042 --> 00:49:22,125
"Dear friend,"

597
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:25,125
"It is important to snatch buns."

598
00:49:25,250 --> 00:49:27,708
"It is a game, no joke."

599
00:49:27,958 --> 00:49:32,500
"One needs energy, and many night congee."

600
00:49:32,667 --> 00:49:34,708
"In my stupid opinion…"

601
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:38,958
"Snatching bun is an Olympic game."

602
00:49:39,083 --> 00:49:41,958
"Let athletes all over the world snatch!"

603
00:49:42,125 --> 00:49:43,833
"And there will be peace."

604
00:49:44,167 --> 00:49:45,667
"Do you have children?"

605
00:49:45,792 --> 00:49:48,417
"I have a boy, Dull."

606
00:49:48,750 --> 00:49:50,167
She's talking about me!

607
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:54,125
"He is a good boy."

608
00:49:54,292 --> 00:49:56,708
"He knows how to snatch buns."

609
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,792
"One day, I can see him snatching buns…"

610
00:50:00,083 --> 00:50:02,292
"Ending up snatching an Olympic medal."

611
00:50:02,583 --> 00:50:06,792
"That is the biggest comfort a mother can get."

612
00:50:07,292 --> 00:50:11,167
"Let the world know the talent of your children."

613
00:50:11,833 --> 00:50:15,167
"Parents will do anything for that."

614
00:50:15,667 --> 00:50:19,333
"That is why I write you this sudden letter."

615
00:50:19,542 --> 00:50:23,333
"Although you don't know humble things like me."

616
00:50:23,625 --> 00:50:26,500
"But my boy is big, very big."

617
00:50:26,667 --> 00:50:29,125
"One day, you will know him too."

618
00:50:29,875 --> 00:50:31,250
"Thank you for your cooperation."

619
00:50:31,583 --> 00:50:34,917
"Yours faithfully, Mrs. Mc."

620
00:50:42,375 --> 00:50:43,833
After reading mother's letter…

621
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:47,000
I go back to Cheung Chau to practice.

622
00:50:48,417 --> 00:50:50,458
Not because of San San.

623
00:50:50,958 --> 00:50:53,042
I don't know why I want to snatch a bun.

624
00:50:53,667 --> 00:50:57,042
And I don't think it will ever become an Olympic sport.

625
00:50:57,708 --> 00:51:01,042
But I keep learning.

626
00:51:01,625 --> 00:51:04,125
Because I love my mother.

627
00:51:05,542 --> 00:51:08,958
Master thinks my crawling has passed.

628
00:51:09,458 --> 00:51:12,583
Now I'll learn the "12 Bun Snatching Hands".

629
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:16,042
Master says these 12 hands,

630
00:51:16,167 --> 00:51:17,958
in its prime…

631
00:51:18,125 --> 00:51:21,042
Was much admired by Butcher Lin!

632
00:51:22,167 --> 00:51:24,000
Later, I learn from McMug…

633
00:51:24,167 --> 00:51:28,375
Butcher Lin was a disciple of the great Kung Fu king.

634
00:51:29,458 --> 00:51:32,458
I don't know much about Kung Fu kings…

635
00:51:32,833 --> 00:51:35,542
But I must be the ultimate pork…

636
00:51:35,708 --> 00:51:37,708
The pork that struts about

637
00:51:37,833 --> 00:51:40,458
with buns in hands.

638
00:51:41,458 --> 00:51:46,000
My mind boggles as I practice, after all…

639
00:51:46,167 --> 00:51:48,458
I am not a fan of bun snatching.

640
00:51:48,917 --> 00:51:50,750
I am only doing this for mother.

641
00:51:50,875 --> 00:51:52,667
Hence I hang on…

642
00:51:52,792 --> 00:51:55,000
Step by step, claw by claw…

643
00:51:55,167 --> 00:51:59,833
I make it pass the "12 Bun Snatching Hands".

644
00:52:10,208 --> 00:52:20,625
"There is no deformity, but saves us from a dream"

645
00:52:21,208 --> 00:52:23,750
This is Dull.

646
00:52:23,833 --> 00:52:27,833
Dull the big guy, not Dull the boy.

647
00:52:28,167 --> 00:52:31,667
The two Dulls have different voices, and then…

648
00:52:32,167 --> 00:52:35,792
Dull the boy's world is still filled with fantasy…

649
00:52:36,583 --> 00:52:38,125
Filled with hopes.

650
00:52:38,583 --> 00:52:40,667
Hope… Disappointment…

651
00:52:40,833 --> 00:52:42,250
Hope…

652
00:52:42,333 --> 00:52:43,625
Disappointment.

653
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,167
On and on, he became Dull the big guy.

654
00:52:47,292 --> 00:52:50,542
But I shall tell more about Dull the boy.

655
00:52:51,125 --> 00:52:53,625
Dull the boy hoped a lot.

656
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:56,417
He hoped there WAS a Santa Claus.

657
00:52:56,583 --> 00:53:00,042
And he hoped to eat a Christmas turkey.

658
00:53:00,833 --> 00:53:03,958
Right, I haven't eaten any turkey then.

659
00:53:04,250 --> 00:53:05,875
Everything about turkey…

660
00:53:06,333 --> 00:53:08,417
The sparkling tinkling Christmas tree…

661
00:53:08,708 --> 00:53:11,042
Like stars falling from the sky…

662
00:53:11,250 --> 00:53:13,208
Coming down by the fireplace.

663
00:53:14,208 --> 00:53:17,667
Each slice of meat looks purer than snow.

664
00:53:18,083 --> 00:53:19,708
Right in front of us…

665
00:53:20,458 --> 00:53:21,833
The aroma attacks our soul…

666
00:53:22,042 --> 00:53:25,292
Waking even the guardian angels.

667
00:53:25,542 --> 00:53:28,750
Who float around the aromatic and holy dish…

668
00:53:29,417 --> 00:53:34,042
Floating in the Christmas night, floating…

669
00:53:35,292 --> 00:53:39,917
All this about turkey was only my imagination.

670
00:53:40,125 --> 00:53:42,417
I had never eaten a turkey.

671
00:53:42,625 --> 00:53:44,667
I had never even smelt one.

672
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:47,125
Mother claimed turkey was too big.

673
00:53:47,708 --> 00:53:50,083
The two of us would never finish it.

674
00:53:50,417 --> 00:53:54,208
One Christmas we celebrated with roast duck.

675
00:53:54,417 --> 00:53:56,792
I was really, really disappointed.

676
00:53:57,792 --> 00:54:00,333
Another year, she bought a mini-oven at 60% off…

677
00:54:00,875 --> 00:54:03,833
At a closedown sale.

678
00:54:04,250 --> 00:54:06,500
Thanks to the oven…

679
00:54:06,917 --> 00:54:08,292
Mother decided one day…

680
00:54:08,417 --> 00:54:11,458
We would go shopping for a turkey.

681
00:54:12,333 --> 00:54:14,917
On the way home, with turkey in hand…

682
00:54:15,333 --> 00:54:18,667
That was the happiest moment in my life.

683
00:54:20,292 --> 00:54:22,000
The turkey was ready.

684
00:54:22,208 --> 00:54:24,542
Following mother, with salt on both hands…

685
00:54:25,083 --> 00:54:28,292
I rubbed the turkey's thick chest.

686
00:54:29,125 --> 00:54:30,000
When sewing up…

687
00:54:30,042 --> 00:54:33,750
Some of the stuffing…

688
00:54:33,875 --> 00:54:35,333
leaked out.

689
00:54:35,708 --> 00:54:37,333
I cried: the turkey's stomach won't stop!

690
00:54:39,042 --> 00:54:41,333
We managed to stuff the turkey into the oven.

691
00:54:42,042 --> 00:54:43,500
24th, December

692
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:47,625
Rising smoke stirred the stars with a crunchy smell.

693
00:54:48,417 --> 00:54:51,583
The oven hummed. Hummed.

694
00:54:52,167 --> 00:54:54,875
It was like early blessing from the angels.

695
00:55:03,625 --> 00:55:05,250
Such a beautiful night!

696
00:55:05,542 --> 00:55:07,583
Mother and I sat at the seafront.

697
00:55:08,250 --> 00:55:12,042
Lights shimmered on the sea.

698
00:55:12,542 --> 00:55:14,958
Beautiful and gentle.

699
00:55:16,208 --> 00:55:18,000
So beautiful!

700
00:55:48,042 --> 00:55:50,125
I had never tasted anything so strong.

701
00:55:50,417 --> 00:55:53,625
Cup noodles or roast duck were not as strong.

702
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:57,333
The taste embedded every single taste bud…

703
00:55:58,250 --> 00:56:02,167
Then exploded.

704
00:56:02,333 --> 00:56:03,958
Like everything tonight…

705
00:56:04,458 --> 00:56:10,542
Most beautiful, brilliant, and tender.

706
00:56:16,333 --> 00:56:18,125
I woke up late the next day.

707
00:56:18,417 --> 00:56:21,667
The sweetness was still there after washing.

708
00:56:22,333 --> 00:56:23,625
As we had a late breakfast…

709
00:56:24,125 --> 00:56:27,583
There was only corn soup for lunch.

710
00:56:27,792 --> 00:56:29,958
I idly found diced turkey…

711
00:56:30,625 --> 00:56:33,000
in the soup.

712
00:56:34,167 --> 00:56:37,083
That night finally came the long awaited…

713
00:56:37,208 --> 00:56:40,708
Christmas turkey dinner!

714
00:56:40,875 --> 00:56:44,875
Slices of meat, accompanied by gourd and potato…

715
00:56:45,083 --> 00:56:47,708
Were dressed with soy sauce.

716
00:56:48,833 --> 00:56:52,000
It was an exciting, satisfactory moment for us.

717
00:56:52,333 --> 00:56:54,500
The following week,

718
00:56:54,625 --> 00:56:57,000
turkey sandwich for breakfast.

719
00:56:57,167 --> 00:56:58,083
Sunday,

720
00:56:58,208 --> 00:57:01,542
I boldly suggested eating out.

721
00:57:01,792 --> 00:57:03,583
Mother said I was ungrateful…

722
00:57:03,708 --> 00:57:05,708
But took me out anyway.

723
00:57:06,333 --> 00:57:08,292
Then mother got inspired again.

724
00:57:08,625 --> 00:57:12,083
What was left of the turkey was sliced…

725
00:57:12,208 --> 00:57:14,625
With me helping out at times.

726
00:57:15,208 --> 00:57:16,917
It was not easy to get rid of…

727
00:57:17,542 --> 00:57:20,208
the turkey's smell.

728
00:57:22,958 --> 00:57:25,667
Fried noodle with sliced turkey, yummy.

729
00:57:26,167 --> 00:57:28,250
Steaming chestnut bowl with sliced turkey.

730
00:57:29,375 --> 00:57:31,583
Peanut congee with turkey bone.

731
00:57:31,750 --> 00:57:33,583
Paper turkey bun.

732
00:57:34,250 --> 00:57:36,542
Paper turkey paper bun.

733
00:57:37,125 --> 00:57:39,667
Turkey pete with bread.

734
00:57:40,625 --> 00:57:46,625
I shouldn't have said anything about the turkey's stomach.

735
00:57:46,917 --> 00:57:51,208
Came Dragon Boat Festival, when I dug into the dumpling…

736
00:57:51,375 --> 00:57:55,792
And found more pieces of turkey…

737
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:59,667
I lost it. I cried.

738
00:58:00,292 --> 00:58:01,792
Oh please!

739
00:58:02,792 --> 00:58:05,875
When mother finally disposed of the turkey…

740
00:58:06,167 --> 00:58:10,417
It was already half a year later.

741
00:58:10,542 --> 00:58:14,542
My beautiful dream ended with my nightmare.

742
00:58:15,125 --> 00:58:16,625
Later, I learned that…

743
00:58:16,792 --> 00:58:18,625
A serving turkey needs only be raised…

744
00:58:18,792 --> 00:58:21,083
For a few months.

745
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:25,417
The time the turkey spent with us…

746
00:58:25,625 --> 00:58:28,208
Was in fact longer than its life.

747
00:58:28,833 --> 00:58:31,417
I realized also, with turkey…

748
00:58:31,583 --> 00:58:35,792
Taking the first bite is all that matters.

749
00:58:36,333 --> 00:58:40,083
Afterwards, it is just "be over and done with".

750
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:43,333
I am no philosopher.

751
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:46,542
I could not come up with any profundity.

752
00:58:47,542 --> 00:58:49,208
But, such thoughts…

753
00:58:49,375 --> 00:58:50,750
After I grew up…

754
00:58:51,750 --> 00:58:54,042
On days unrelated to Christmas…

755
00:58:54,875 --> 00:58:58,292
Did come up again a couple of times.

756
00:59:00,333 --> 00:59:03,708
Once, it was at my wedding.

757
00:59:04,208 --> 00:59:05,500
Once…

758
00:59:05,667 --> 00:59:07,917
It was at my mother's cremation.

759
00:59:08,875 --> 00:59:12,833
That day, I was looking at the smoke rising up.

760
00:59:13,625 --> 00:59:16,792
Suddenly, the smell of the turkey returned.

761
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:22,542
I regretted I made mother throw the turkey away.

762
01:00:11,583 --> 01:00:18,500
"Special Report"

763
01:00:21,833 --> 01:00:23,208
"Special Report"

764
01:00:23,417 --> 01:00:28,000
Olympic medal winner San San Li will compete again…

765
01:00:28,125 --> 01:00:29,792
To prove to the world that…

766
01:00:29,917 --> 01:00:32,542
HK athletes are horrible.

767
01:00:33,167 --> 01:00:34,083
Also…

768
01:00:34,208 --> 01:00:37,625
The local federation…

769
01:00:37,750 --> 01:00:40,000
officially announced today:

770
01:00:40,125 --> 01:00:43,542
HK will apply to host the Asian Games.

771
01:00:44,250 --> 01:00:47,458
The response from all sides has been enthusiastic.

772
01:00:48,292 --> 01:00:50,792
Among them, the Bamboo Game Association…

773
01:00:50,958 --> 01:00:53,875
is proposing Mahjong for official game.

774
01:00:54,375 --> 01:00:57,000
While Tearoom Serving Groups…

775
01:00:57,125 --> 01:00:58,458
have vowed…

776
01:00:58,625 --> 01:01:02,458
To campaign for "Tart Throwing".

777
01:01:02,917 --> 01:01:05,125
As for the Cold Cut and Roasting Association…

778
01:01:05,250 --> 01:01:07,500
They believe…

779
01:01:07,667 --> 01:01:11,000
"Duck Hanging" would make an ideal addition.

780
01:01:12,042 --> 01:01:15,958
More interesting, CIC Insurance is joining forces with…

781
01:01:16,083 --> 01:01:17,958
Children from…

782
01:01:18,125 --> 01:01:20,167
Spring Flower Primary School…

783
01:01:20,333 --> 01:01:22,333
In support of…

784
01:01:22,708 --> 01:01:24,375
"Bun Snatching"…

785
01:01:24,542 --> 01:01:28,542
A game thought extinct.

786
01:02:30,917 --> 01:02:32,042
In the end…

787
01:02:32,500 --> 01:02:34,875
Nothing came of anything.

788
01:02:35,375 --> 01:02:38,875
"Tart Throwing" was chosen as the highlight.

789
01:02:39,125 --> 01:02:41,458
As for the official slogan…

790
01:02:41,625 --> 01:02:45,542
"HK, One Big Tart" was a logical choice.

791
01:02:47,292 --> 01:02:49,625
Then San San Li lost.

792
01:02:51,917 --> 01:02:53,000
And the hosting right of the Asian Games…

793
01:02:53,125 --> 01:02:56,375
Went to a place Hong Kong people have never heard of.

794
01:02:58,500 --> 01:03:01,625
Tearoom workers, those aspiring athletes…

795
01:03:01,750 --> 01:03:05,292
Went back to where they used to throw their tarts.

796
01:03:05,417 --> 01:03:07,083
Everything went on as usual.

797
01:03:12,375 --> 01:03:15,792
In secondary school, I stopped practicing the 12 hands.

798
01:03:16,917 --> 01:03:18,500
Sometimes, when I went out with mother…

799
01:03:18,667 --> 01:03:21,542
I'd still snatch a bun for her.

800
01:03:22,875 --> 01:03:25,250
Then they stopped selling buns.

801
01:03:26,167 --> 01:03:28,708
Carts were replaced by ordering sheets.

802
01:03:29,417 --> 01:03:31,542
Everything came to nothing.

803
01:03:42,333 --> 01:03:45,458
At times, I'd go to Cheung Chau for barbecue.

804
01:03:45,958 --> 01:03:47,542
The master looked older…

805
01:03:47,792 --> 01:03:49,708
Each time I saw him.

806
01:03:54,250 --> 01:03:55,542
For environmental reasons…

807
01:03:55,708 --> 01:03:58,958
They'd changed to snatching plastic buns.

808
01:04:00,125 --> 01:04:03,417
Master thought they stunk.

809
01:04:09,250 --> 01:04:11,417
On Cheung Chau was a Cheung Po Tsai Cave.

810
01:04:11,792 --> 01:04:15,792
Where legend claimed a pirate hid his treasure.

811
01:04:16,958 --> 01:04:20,500
As I was the one who could crawl…

812
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:25,250
My mates said I should take a look and maybe get rich.

813
01:04:25,417 --> 01:04:29,042
So I crawled along the dark and narrow cave.

814
01:04:29,333 --> 01:04:32,417
Crawling.

815
01:04:32,917 --> 01:04:36,708
There was nothing but a box.

816
01:04:37,250 --> 01:04:39,000
I opened the box…

817
01:04:39,167 --> 01:04:42,417
Inside, there was an unfinished bun.

818
01:04:43,167 --> 01:04:45,667
Maybe the pirate didn't get to finish it.

819
01:04:46,958 --> 01:04:55,542
"Eating 6 buns last night…"

820
01:04:55,667 --> 01:05:04,500
"Still left me hungry."

821
01:05:05,333 --> 01:05:13,250
"Eating 1½ lb white bread last night…"

822
01:05:13,417 --> 01:05:24,792
"Still left me hungry."

823
01:05:26,750 --> 01:05:35,042
"Excelled 6 sets of steps when I was young…"

824
01:05:35,208 --> 01:05:42,458
"Still left me empty."

825
01:05:44,042 --> 01:05:57,375
"Brought up San San when I am old! Still…"

826
01:05:57,917 --> 01:06:01,292
Bun in hand, I suddenly realized…

827
01:06:02,333 --> 01:06:06,292
There are things that cannot be forced.

828
01:06:07,125 --> 01:06:09,292
A no is a no.

829
01:06:10,458 --> 01:06:14,083
No fishball, no noodle, no Maldives…

830
01:06:14,250 --> 01:06:16,500
No medal, no pirate's treasure.

831
01:06:17,250 --> 01:06:20,542
And the pirate took no bite.

832
01:06:21,167 --> 01:06:24,292
Stupid is not funny.

833
01:06:25,583 --> 01:06:27,000
Stupid leads to failure…

834
01:06:27,708 --> 01:06:29,083
To disappointment.

835
01:06:30,625 --> 01:06:33,333
Disappointed is not funny.

836
01:06:34,208 --> 01:06:36,208
Fatness is not funny too.

837
01:06:37,500 --> 01:06:39,667
Fatness is not powerful.

838
01:06:39,875 --> 01:06:41,917
Power doesn't mean yes.

839
01:06:44,667 --> 01:06:47,208
Bun in hand, I suddenly thought…

840
01:06:47,583 --> 01:06:50,042
Growing up, facing this sordid world…

841
01:06:50,750 --> 01:06:53,417
This not so dreamy, not so funny world…

842
01:06:53,583 --> 01:06:57,625
What shall I be?

843
01:07:05,375 --> 01:07:16,417
"… Nothing shall be done!"

844
01:07:30,833 --> 01:07:31,958
"I Have Grown Up"

845
01:07:35,292 --> 01:07:37,125
"Fat, Still"

846
01:07:39,792 --> 01:07:41,625
"Powerful"

847
01:08:19,458 --> 01:08:22,333
Right, I am McDull the big guy.

848
01:08:23,542 --> 01:08:26,500
Fat, with raw power.

849
01:08:27,083 --> 01:08:28,958
Not doing too well.

850
01:08:29,750 --> 01:08:31,333
Negative property.

851
01:08:34,042 --> 01:08:38,292
With a pair of really thick calves.

852
01:08:39,250 --> 01:08:41,917
Very muscular…

853
01:08:42,375 --> 01:08:47,083
With steely veins running down.

854
01:08:47,917 --> 01:08:50,000
As for the toenails…

855
01:08:50,333 --> 01:08:53,417
I got bored one time and stared at it…

856
01:08:53,833 --> 01:08:56,750
They're tough, no kidding!

857
01:08:58,458 --> 01:09:00,958
Yes, the story ends here.

858
01:09:01,708 --> 01:09:03,500
This is a try.

859
01:09:04,375 --> 01:09:07,417
Error… Try…

860
01:09:07,917 --> 01:09:11,458
No guarantee that one would make it.

861
01:09:12,875 --> 01:09:14,500
In the end…

862
01:09:14,917 --> 01:09:18,042
Zero gain? Not really.

863
01:09:18,625 --> 01:09:21,667
I have my calves.

864
01:09:23,083 --> 01:09:25,792
But, standing here like this…

865
01:09:26,250 --> 01:09:28,250
When the waves hit…

866
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:32,250
I feel great.

867
01:09:34,167 --> 01:09:37,083
You see, smart guys like me don't really know…

868
01:09:37,250 --> 01:09:41,500
How to make a lesson out of his own story.

869
01:09:42,042 --> 01:09:44,833
With calves in water…

870
01:09:45,292 --> 01:09:50,417
When the wind blows, I'd think…

871
01:09:50,750 --> 01:09:53,167
If mother could see me like this…

872
01:09:55,167 --> 01:09:57,208
She'd be happy.

873
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:15,750
"I've come up with a lesson!"

874
01:10:16,417 --> 01:10:20,708
Mother got inspired after her dot com failed.

875
01:10:21,208 --> 01:10:24,958
She published a cookbook.

876
01:10:25,250 --> 01:10:28,042
The last recipe was "Roast Chicken".

877
01:10:28,417 --> 01:10:30,875
A simple dish no less.

878
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:32,000
"Roast Chicken".

879
01:10:32,292 --> 01:10:34,375
Ingredient: chicken.

880
01:10:34,625 --> 01:10:38,625
Method: roast the chicken.

881
01:10:38,833 --> 01:10:43,083
That way, you have a roast chicken.

882
01:10:44,417 --> 01:10:46,375
There was a remark in the cookbook:

883
01:10:47,083 --> 01:10:49,417
If you want a delicious chicken…

884
01:10:50,125 --> 01:10:52,750
A chicken that wouldn't upset you…

885
01:10:53,250 --> 01:10:58,250
The secret is: please, roast it well!

886
01:10:59,083 --> 01:11:01,208
Thank you!

887
01:11:40,583 --> 01:11:42,542
One Regular, please.

888
01:11:42,667 --> 01:11:44,667
What's a Regular?

889
01:11:44,833 --> 01:11:46,042
The same as Special.

890
01:11:46,167 --> 01:11:47,292
What's a Special?

891
01:11:47,458 --> 01:11:48,792
Same as Quickie.

892
01:11:48,917 --> 01:11:50,375
What's a Quickie?

893
01:11:50,625 --> 01:11:52,625
A Quickie is a Lunch.

894
01:11:52,833 --> 01:11:53,875
What's for Lunch?

895
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:55,750
The same as Supper.

896
01:11:55,917 --> 01:11:57,333
What's for Supper?

897
01:11:57,500 --> 01:11:59,667
Same as Regular.

898
01:11:59,833 --> 01:12:01,792
We'll have the Regular.

899
01:12:01,875 --> 01:12:04,750
Our Regular today is fantastic!

900
01:12:09,125 --> 01:12:11,417
Sorry, Regular is gone.

901
01:12:11,875 --> 01:12:13,083
We can have the Special.

902
01:12:13,333 --> 01:12:15,208
What's a Special?

903
01:12:15,458 --> 01:12:17,042
A Special is a Lunch.

904
01:12:17,542 --> 01:12:18,792
What's for Lunch?

905
01:12:19,083 --> 01:12:20,625
What you get for Supper.

906
01:12:20,875 --> 01:12:22,292
What's for Supper?

907
01:12:22,458 --> 01:12:23,792
Same as Quickie.

908
01:12:23,917 --> 01:12:25,208
What's for Quickie?

909
01:12:25,375 --> 01:12:27,667
A Quickie is a Regular.

910
01:12:27,833 --> 01:12:29,750
But you said Regular is gone!

911
01:12:29,875 --> 01:12:33,417
Regular sure is gone. How about the Special?

912
01:12:34,167 --> 01:12:35,542
It's the Special, then.

913
01:12:37,500 --> 01:12:40,500
Sorry, Special is gone.

914
01:12:41,167 --> 01:12:43,708
Mother, let's have the Quickie.

915
01:12:44,042 --> 01:12:45,417
What's for Quickie?

916
01:12:45,542 --> 01:12:47,167
A Quickie is a Regular.

917
01:12:47,333 --> 01:12:48,833
What's for Regular?

918
01:12:49,167 --> 01:12:51,167
A Regular is a Lunch.

919
01:12:51,292 --> 01:12:52,958
What's for Lunch?

920
01:12:53,167 --> 01:12:55,375
Same as Supper.

921
01:12:55,542 --> 01:12:56,292
And Supper?

922
01:12:56,458 --> 01:12:58,125
Supper is like Special.

923
01:12:58,292 --> 01:13:00,250
But you said the Special is gone.

924
01:13:00,375 --> 01:13:05,125
The Special sure is gone. Try Quickie. It's the same.

925
01:13:05,292 --> 01:13:06,333
We'll have Quickie.

926
01:13:09,667 --> 01:13:11,542
Sorry, Quickie is gone.

927
01:13:11,667 --> 01:13:14,375
This is too much! Is there anything we can eat here?

928
01:13:14,542 --> 01:13:16,333
Try the Lunch. It's fantastic!

929
01:13:16,375 --> 01:13:17,417
How so?

930
01:13:17,583 --> 01:13:18,833
It's like the Supper.

931
01:13:18,958 --> 01:13:20,375
What about the Supper?

932
01:13:20,542 --> 01:13:22,208
It's like the Regular.

933
01:13:22,333 --> 01:13:23,542
And what about the Regular?

934
01:13:23,750 --> 01:13:27,292
The Regular is gone. Isn't that fantastic?

935
01:13:29,917 --> 01:13:31,625
Great! We'll have Lunch.

936
01:13:35,625 --> 01:13:37,625
Sorry, Lunch is gone.

937
01:13:37,792 --> 01:13:40,500
Try our Supper. It's all the same.

938
01:13:40,667 --> 01:13:42,542
I'm not having supper under broad daylight!

939
01:13:42,792 --> 01:13:46,125
What's in a name? It's the same as Lunch.

940
01:13:46,333 --> 01:13:49,750
Great! Whatever you say! And make it quick!

941
01:13:49,917 --> 01:13:53,417
You want it quick? Try Quickie!
