1
00:00:48,792 --> 00:00:51,125
When Mrs. McBing was in labour...

2
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:54,000
a pan appeared in the sky.

3
00:00:55,042 --> 00:00:58,208
It flew along Garden Street...

4
00:00:58,375 --> 00:01:04,750
turned left, and stopped
at the Beefball King.

5
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:06,958
Correction:

6
00:01:07,083 --> 00:01:10,042
It first arrived at the Market Building...

7
00:01:10,333 --> 00:01:13,292
lingered a bit... Correction:

8
00:01:13,375 --> 00:01:18,458
it flew over the railway, turned right...

9
00:01:18,583 --> 00:01:23,792
and headed directly for the Bazaar.

10
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:25,708
It flew on...

11
00:01:25,875 --> 00:01:29,042
at last coming into the maternity ward.

12
00:01:29,208 --> 00:01:32,500
There, on the right hand side of
Mrs. McBing.

13
00:01:32,792 --> 00:01:35,083
Correction: Left hand side.

14
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:37,708
The pan stayed.

15
00:01:38,167 --> 00:01:40,167
Mrs. McBing,
convinced that this was a miracle,

16
00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:43,292
made a wish...

17
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:47,167
thinking of her soon-to-be-born son.

18
00:01:47,333 --> 00:01:50,458
Please make him
a clever and smart boy!

19
00:01:50,708 --> 00:01:53,833
The pan didn't seem to hear her words.

20
00:01:53,958 --> 00:01:56,167
So Mrs. McBing amended her wish:

21
00:01:56,333 --> 00:01:58,875
Or make him a smart businessman?

22
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,542
Or maybe...

23
00:02:00,667 --> 00:02:02,542
or make him really handsome.

24
00:02:02,708 --> 00:02:06,042
As handsome as Chow Yun Fat or
Tony Leung!

25
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:12,042
The pan didn't respond.

26
00:02:12,167 --> 00:02:13,583
Mrs. McBing, in panic...

27
00:02:13,792 --> 00:02:17,667
made a final amendment:

28
00:02:18,042 --> 00:02:21,708
Her boy need not be
smart or handsome

29
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:24,917
As long as luck be with him!

30
00:02:25,958 --> 00:02:29,542
It's nice to depend on oneself...

31
00:02:29,667 --> 00:02:31,917
but luck is essential still.

32
00:02:32,167 --> 00:02:35,500
Of course Chow and Leung are
lucky guys...

33
00:02:36,292 --> 00:02:38,875
but then they are smart too!

34
00:02:42,208 --> 00:02:44,542
Finally, the pan dropped to the floor...

35
00:02:44,708 --> 00:02:49,458
Mrs. McBing,
believing her wish granted...

36
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:52,417
thought that was magnificent!

37
00:02:52,583 --> 00:02:54,167
But what had the pan granted her?

38
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:57,375
A smart boy? A lucky boy?

39
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,417
Or a Chow look-alike?

40
00:03:00,667 --> 00:03:02,708
To commemorate this, Mrs. McBing

41
00:03:03,208 --> 00:03:06,250
decided to name her son McNificient.

42
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:09,750
No! It's better to be humble!

43
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:11,958
I'll name him McDull!

44
00:03:12,167 --> 00:03:13,292
Dear all...

45
00:03:13,458 --> 00:03:16,208
I am the boy, no more McNificient...

46
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:18,542
I'm McDull!

47
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:43,375
"My School"

48
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:45,083
Oh dear,

49
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:47,083
your calves have grown strong.

50
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:48,875
I've been desperately...

51
00:04:49,042 --> 00:04:50,500
looking for a school!

52
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:52,667
Why not try the one...

53
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:54,667
At the Emporium?

54
00:04:54,792 --> 00:04:57,083
The Spring Flower Kindergarten?

55
00:04:57,292 --> 00:04:59,833
Yeah! The one at the junction...

56
00:05:00,042 --> 00:05:01,667
Right next to Silver City Food Mall.

57
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:03,833
The Spring Flower Kindergarten!

58
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,208
Only 10 minutes' walk from
the MTR station!

59
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:11,625
Spring Flower Kindergarten,
good environment...

60
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:14,208
With white teachers for English class!

61
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:16,125
White teachers for English class?

62
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:16,958
Yeah!

63
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:22,417
Spring Flower offers white teachers!

64
00:05:31,292 --> 00:05:35,958
"We are all happy children..."

65
00:05:36,042 --> 00:05:40,917
"We sing every day!"

66
00:05:41,042 --> 00:05:45,625
"We learn as we grow..."

67
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:50,792
"We are the flowers of spring!"

68
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:54,083
This piggy kid in a rabbit outfit...

69
00:05:54,292 --> 00:05:58,625
Who doesn't look the least
like Chow or Leung...

70
00:05:58,792 --> 00:06:01,167
That's me, McDull.

71
00:06:02,292 --> 00:06:04,000
This is my kindergarten.

72
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:06,542
The headmaster came from
the countryside...

73
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,875
As a result, he speaks with an accent.

74
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:10,208
For many years...

75
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:12,875
I had difficulty understanding him.

76
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:17,833
- Tart!    - Tart!

77
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,583
- Duck dumpling!    - Duck dumpling!

78
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:29,792
- The 97 Rule...    - The 97 Rule...

79
00:06:29,958 --> 00:06:33,083
shall be replaced by the 98 Rule!

80
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:38,792
shall be replaced by the 98 Rule!

81
00:06:39,167 --> 00:06:40,667
Good, children!

82
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:43,208
We are sharing an important issue...

83
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:45,000
this morning:

84
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:48,417
Children, have you handed in
the school fee?

85
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:50,792
Yes!

86
00:06:50,958 --> 00:06:54,375
Great! Now move on to class.

87
00:06:57,875 --> 00:07:00,417
You might conclude that
this is a shabby school.

88
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:03,125
But for me and my mates...

89
00:07:03,708 --> 00:07:06,625
This is the most beautiful paradise!

90
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,000
...also, there is Miss Chan.

91
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:12,833
who adores us in
her absent-minded way.

92
00:07:13,917 --> 00:07:16,083
Also, she is a Faye Wong wannabe.

93
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:18,708
Actually, Kelly Chan will do!

94
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:20,750
Roll call now.

95
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:22,708
McMug!    - Present!

96
00:07:22,917 --> 00:07:24,375
- Fai!    - Present!

97
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,667
Goosie! Present!

98
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:28,750
- Darby!    - Present!

99
00:07:28,917 --> 00:07:31,708
May! Present!

100
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:33,750
June! Present!

101
00:07:33,917 --> 00:07:36,667
May! Present!

102
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:40,000
- McMug!    - Present!

103
00:07:40,167 --> 00:07:41,292
May!

104
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:43,417
Miss Chan, I've been called twice!

105
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:45,208
Oops!

106
00:07:45,917 --> 00:07:48,417
Good morning, sir!

107
00:07:49,292 --> 00:07:52,250
Good day, sir!

108
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:55,250
Back to roll call.

109
00:07:55,792 --> 00:07:57,583
- Fai!    - Present!

110
00:07:57,792 --> 00:07:58,958
- Fai!    - Present!

111
00:07:59,167 --> 00:08:01,333
- Darby!    - Present!

112
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:03,250
May! Present!

113
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,500
- McMug!    - Present!

114
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,875
Goosie! Present!

115
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:09,458
Goosie! Present!

116
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:11,375
Have I missed anyone?

117
00:08:11,542 --> 00:08:13,458
McDull!

118
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:15,667
McDull!

119
00:08:16,667 --> 00:08:18,208
McDull!

120
00:08:18,708 --> 00:08:20,000
McDull!

121
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:22,167
Hey, I don't understand.

122
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:23,625
I keep feeling that...

123
00:08:23,792 --> 00:08:27,625
Someone is calling me.

124
00:08:28,583 --> 00:08:30,500
Don't think that I've been daydreaming.

125
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:33,667
Was contemplating something academic:

126
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:36,917
How does this universe work?

127
00:08:37,542 --> 00:08:39,833
I mean, I ate 6 oranges that morning.

128
00:08:40,042 --> 00:08:44,542
And my stomach wouldn't stop.

129
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:47,125
Then I ate 3 bananas this morning.

130
00:08:47,292 --> 00:08:50,375
Again my stomach wouldn't stop.

131
00:08:50,542 --> 00:08:52,958
It just wouldn't stop!

132
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:57,083
How are these two things related?

133
00:08:57,958 --> 00:09:00,500
There are so many things that
I don't understand.

134
00:09:00,667 --> 00:09:02,292
But I am not afraid.

135
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,667
One day, when I finish kindergarten...

136
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:08,000
I shall move up...

137
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:09,750
and get my degree.

138
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:11,167
When I graduate from university, I know...

139
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,292
I shall understand everything!

140
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:14,583
And then

141
00:09:15,125 --> 00:09:17,292
I will buy my mother a house!
