1
00:00:48,792 --> 00:00:51,125
When Mrs. McBing was in labour...

2
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:54,000
A pan appeared in the sky.

3
00:00:55,042 --> 00:00:58,208
It flew along Garden Street...

4
00:00:58,375 --> 00:01:04,750
Turned left, and stopped
at the Beefball King.

5
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:06,958
Correction:

6
00:01:07,083 --> 00:01:10,042
It first arrived at the Market Building...

7
00:01:10,333 --> 00:01:13,292
Lingered a bit... Correction:

8
00:01:13,375 --> 00:01:18,458
It flew over the railway, turned right...

9
00:01:18,583 --> 00:01:23,792
And headed directly for the Bazaar.

10
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:25,708
It flew on...

11
00:01:25,875 --> 00:01:29,042
At last coming into the maternity ward.

12
00:01:29,208 --> 00:01:32,500
There, on the right hand side of
Mrs. McBing.

13
00:01:32,792 --> 00:01:35,083
Correction: Left hand side.

14
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:37,708
The pan stayed.

15
00:01:38,167 --> 00:01:40,167
Mrs. McBing,
convinced that this was a miracle,

16
00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:43,292
Made a wish...

17
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:47,167
Thinking of her soon-to-be-born son.

18
00:01:47,333 --> 00:01:50,458
Please make him
a clever and smart boy!

19
00:01:50,708 --> 00:01:53,833
The pan didn't seem to hear her words.

20
00:01:53,958 --> 00:01:56,167
So Mrs. McBing amended her wish:

21
00:01:56,333 --> 00:01:58,875
Or make him a smart businessman?

22
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,542
Or maybe...

23
00:02:00,667 --> 00:02:02,542
Or make him really handsome.

24
00:02:02,708 --> 00:02:06,042
As handsome as Chow Yun Fat or
Tony Leung!

25
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:12,042
The pan didn't respond.

26
00:02:12,167 --> 00:02:13,583
Mrs. McBing, in panic...

27
00:02:13,792 --> 00:02:17,667
Made a final amendment:

28
00:02:18,042 --> 00:02:21,708
Her boy need not be
smart or handsome

29
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:24,917
As long as luck be with him!

30
00:02:25,958 --> 00:02:29,542
It's nice to depend on oneself...

31
00:02:29,667 --> 00:02:31,917
But luck is essential still.

32
00:02:32,167 --> 00:02:35,500
Of course Chow and Leung are
lucky guys...

33
00:02:36,292 --> 00:02:38,875
But then they are smart too!

34
00:02:42,208 --> 00:02:44,542
Finally, the pan dropped to the floor...

35
00:02:44,708 --> 00:02:49,458
Mrs. McBing,
believing her wish granted...

36
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:52,417
Thought that was magnificent!

37
00:02:52,583 --> 00:02:54,167
But what had the pan granted her?

38
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:57,375
A smart boy? A lucky boy?

39
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,417
Or a Chow look-alike?

40
00:03:00,667 --> 00:03:02,708
To commemorate this, Mrs. McBing...

41
00:03:03,208 --> 00:03:06,250
Decided to name her son McNificient.

42
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:09,750
No! It's better to be humble!

43
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:11,958
I'll name him McDull!

44
00:03:12,167 --> 00:03:13,292
Dear all...

45
00:03:13,458 --> 00:03:16,208
I am the boy, no more McNificient...

46
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:18,542
I'm McDull!

47
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:43,375
"My School"

48
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:45,083
Oh dear,

49
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:47,083
your calves have grown strong.

50
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:48,875
I've been desperately...

51
00:04:49,042 --> 00:04:50,500
looking for a school!

52
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:52,667
Why not try the one...

53
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:54,667
at the Emporium?

54
00:04:54,792 --> 00:04:57,083
The Spring Flower Kindergarten?

55
00:04:57,292 --> 00:04:59,833
Yeah! The one at the junction...

56
00:05:00,042 --> 00:05:01,667
Right next to Silver City Food Mall.

57
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:03,833
The Spring Flower Kindergarten!

58
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,208
Only 10 minutes' walk from
the MTR Station!

59
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:11,625
Spring Flower Kindergarten,
good environment...

60
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:14,208
With white teachers for English class!

61
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:16,125
White teachers for English class?

62
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:16,958
Yeah!

63
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:22,417
Spring Flower offers white teachers!

64
00:05:31,292 --> 00:05:35,958
"We are all happy children..."

65
00:05:36,042 --> 00:05:40,917
"We sing every day!"

66
00:05:41,042 --> 00:05:45,625
"We learn as we grow..."

67
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:50,792
"We are the flowers of spring!"

68
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:54,083
This piggy kid in a rabbit outfit...

69
00:05:54,292 --> 00:05:58,625
Who doesn't look the least
like Chow or Leung...

70
00:05:58,792 --> 00:06:01,167
That's me, McDull.

71
00:06:02,292 --> 00:06:04,000
This is my kindergarten.

72
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:06,542
The headmaster came from
the countryside...

73
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,875
As a result, he speaks with an accent.

74
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:10,208
For many years...

75
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:12,875
I had difficulty hearing him.

76
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:17,833
- Tart! - Tart!

77
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,583
- Duck dumpling! - Duck dumpling!

78
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:29,792
- The 97 Rule... - The 97 Rule...

79
00:06:29,958 --> 00:06:33,083
Shall be replaced by the 98 Rule!

80
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:38,792
Shall be replaced by the 98 Rule!

81
00:06:39,167 --> 00:06:40,667
Good, children!

82
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:43,208
We are sharing an important issue...

83
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:45,000
this morning:

84
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:48,417
Children, have you handed in
the school fee?

85
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:50,792
Yes!

86
00:06:50,958 --> 00:06:54,375
Great! Now move to class.

87
00:06:57,875 --> 00:07:00,417
You might conclude that
this is a shabby school.

88
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:03,125
But, for me and my mates...

89
00:07:03,708 --> 00:07:06,625
This is the most beautiful paradise!

90
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,000
...Also, there is Miss Chan.

91
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:12,833
Who adores us in
her absent-minded way.

92
00:07:13,917 --> 00:07:16,083
Also, she is a Faye Wong wannabe.

93
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:18,708
Actually, Kelly Chan will do!

94
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:20,750
Roll call now.

95
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:22,708
- McMug! - Present!

96
00:07:22,917 --> 00:07:24,375
- Fai! - Present!

97
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,667
- Goosie! - Present!

98
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:28,750
- Darby! - Present!

99
00:07:28,917 --> 00:07:31,708
- May! - Present!

100
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:33,750
- June! - Present!

101
00:07:33,917 --> 00:07:36,667
- May! - Present!

102
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:40,000
- McMug! - Present!

103
00:07:40,167 --> 00:07:41,292
May!

104
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:43,417
Miss Chan, I've been called twice!

105
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:45,208
Oops!

106
00:07:45,917 --> 00:07:48,417
Good morning, sir!

107
00:07:49,292 --> 00:07:52,250
Good day, sir!

108
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:55,250
Back to roll call.

109
00:07:55,792 --> 00:07:57,583
- Fai! - Present!

110
00:07:57,792 --> 00:07:58,958
- Fai! - Present!

111
00:07:59,167 --> 00:08:01,333
- Darby! - Present!

112
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:03,250
- May! - Present!

113
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,500
- McMug! - Present!

114
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,875
- Goosie! - Present!

115
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:09,458
- Goosie! - Present!

116
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:11,375
Have I missed anyone?

117
00:08:11,542 --> 00:08:13,458
McDull!

118
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:15,667
McDull!

119
00:08:16,667 --> 00:08:18,208
McDull!

120
00:08:18,708 --> 00:08:20,000
McDull!

121
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:22,167
Hey, I don't understand...

122
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:23,625
I keep feeling that...

123
00:08:23,792 --> 00:08:27,625
Someone is calling me.

124
00:08:28,583 --> 00:08:30,500
Don't think that I've been daydreaming.

125
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:33,667
I was contemplating something academic:

126
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:36,917
How does this universe work?

127
00:08:37,542 --> 00:08:39,833
I mean, I ate 6 oranges that morning...

128
00:08:40,042 --> 00:08:44,542
And my stomach wouldn't stop.

129
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:47,125
Then I ate 3 bananas this morning.

130
00:08:47,292 --> 00:08:50,375
Again my stomach wouldn't stop...

131
00:08:50,542 --> 00:08:52,958
It just wouldn't stop!

132
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:57,083
How are these two things related?

133
00:08:57,958 --> 00:09:00,500
There are so many things that
I don't understand.

134
00:09:00,667 --> 00:09:02,292
But I am not afraid.

135
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,667
One day, when I finish kindergarten...

136
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:08,000
I shall move up...

137
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:09,750
And get my degree.

138
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:11,167
When I graduate from university, I know...

139
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,292
I shall understand everything!

140
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:14,583
And then...

141
00:09:15,125 --> 00:09:17,292
I will buy my mother a house!

142
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:24,125
Our headmaster runs a tea stand...

143
00:09:24,292 --> 00:09:27,375
Which we kids frequent after class.

144
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:30,125
- Fishball noodles, please.
- No noodles left.

145
00:09:30,417 --> 00:09:33,917
- Fishball rice noodles then.
- No fishballs left.

146
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:37,792
- Chicken wing noodles then.
- No noodles left.

147
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:41,833
- How about fishball congee?
- No fishballs left.

148
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,417
Nothing left today?

149
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:46,625
- How about beef noodles?
- No noodles left.

150
00:09:46,917 --> 00:09:47,958
Again?

151
00:09:48,167 --> 00:09:51,708
- Fried chicken wing with fishballs...
- No fishballs left.

152
00:09:51,917 --> 00:09:55,333
Hey, fishball and noodle are both gone...

153
00:09:55,542 --> 00:09:58,917
You can't combine them with other things.

154
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:02,125
Can't combine them?

155
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:04,917
- A bowl of fishballs then.
- No fishballs left.

156
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:06,667
- A bowl of noodles?
- No noodles left.

157
00:10:07,792 --> 00:10:08,708
By now...

158
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:11,250
you can probably tell how smart I am.

159
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,958
Nothing worried me, all things were fine.

160
00:10:14,292 --> 00:10:17,000
No fishballs left? Let's get some noodles.

161
00:10:17,167 --> 00:10:20,042
Shoot, Dull!

162
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:25,625
Watching myself grow and grow...

163
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:27,625
Every day...

164
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:29,292
I feel full of strength!

165
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:30,833
The world is beautiful!

166
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:36,750
There is a song Miss Chan loves...

167
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,375
Which I always want to learn...

168
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:41,667
But it just comes out different.

169
00:10:41,792 --> 00:10:44,375
You mean
"All Things Bright and Beautiful"?

170
00:10:44,542 --> 00:10:46,375
Yes, all are fine!

171
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:47,708
All things on earth...

172
00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:50,375
They are fine!!

173
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:45,375
"My Mother"

174
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:56,500
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7...

175
00:11:56,625 --> 00:11:57,792
No pain no gain!

176
00:11:57,958 --> 00:12:01,417
Monday till Sunday... No pain no gain!

177
00:12:01,792 --> 00:12:03,750
The middle-aged swine is Mrs. McBing,

178
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:05,750
my mother...

179
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:07,500
A brilliant woman...

180
00:12:07,708 --> 00:12:09,833
carrying the world!

181
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:08,875
Yes, she is really something.

182
00:13:09,042 --> 00:13:11,792
She works in insurance,
real estate and trading.

183
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:15,333
At the height of IT,
she even set up her cooking site...

184
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:19,500
www.MrsMcBing.com

185
00:13:20,042 --> 00:13:22,292
Offering brilliant dishes.

186
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:25,500
Welcome to "Mrs. Mc Can Cook".

187
00:13:26,042 --> 00:13:27,542
Today we're doing a simple dish,

188
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:31,125
Paper Chicken.

189
00:13:31,292 --> 00:13:33,625
Kids at home would love it.

190
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:37,208
The ingredient: a chicken bun.

191
00:13:37,708 --> 00:13:42,750
Slowly, we tear the paper away
from the bun

192
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:45,708
Now we have a bun paper.

193
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:49,375
Turn the paper over like this...

194
00:13:49,792 --> 00:13:54,667
Voila! Simple, isn't it?

195
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:56,792
Thank you, everyone!

196
00:14:04,667 --> 00:14:07,083
How time flies since the last episode!

197
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:10,708
Now we shall do a Paper Bun.

198
00:14:11,292 --> 00:14:14,667
The only ingredient is paper.

199
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:19,333
Do it like this...

200
00:14:20,042 --> 00:14:22,917
And we have a Paper Bun.

201
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:26,708
Isn't this a lovely bun?

202
00:14:33,292 --> 00:14:37,375
A novelty today for everyone:

203
00:14:37,542 --> 00:14:40,958
Chicken Bun Paper Bunning a Bun.

204
00:14:41,125 --> 00:14:45,042
First, unwrap the chicken
from the paper.

205
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:49,708
Now we have a paper and
a piece of chicken.

206
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:54,458
Use the bun paper to wrap up
the chicken like this...

207
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:59,458
And then wrap it like this...

208
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:05,292
The delicious Chicken Bun Paper
Bunning a Bun!

209
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:06,958
Such a simple dish!

210
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:09,250
See if the chicken is good!

211
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:17,875
Kids are bound to love...

212
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:19,458
today's dish...

213
00:15:19,917 --> 00:15:24,375
Bunning a Chicken Bun Paper...

214
00:15:24,542 --> 00:15:27,667
Bunning the Paper Chicken.

215
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,583
It's simple work.

216
00:15:31,792 --> 00:15:34,958
Use the chicken bun to bun...

217
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:36,667
the chicken bun...

218
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:38,542
Then use the chicken bun paper to...

219
00:15:38,708 --> 00:15:41,708
bun and bun...

220
00:15:41,917 --> 00:15:46,250
Paper, bun, bun, paper, bun...

221
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:52,542
Paper, chicken, bun, bun, chicken...

222
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:57,750
But my mother has her tender side.

223
00:15:57,917 --> 00:16:01,083
Every night,
she tells me a story before sleep.

224
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:05,792
Once upon a time, a boy lied. One day...

225
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,833
He died.

226
00:16:10,667 --> 00:16:13,792
Once upon a time, a boy studied hard.

227
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:16,583
He grew up and got rich.

228
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:21,708
Once upon a time, a boy was naughty.
One day...

229
00:16:21,833 --> 00:16:23,417
He twisted his ankle.

230
00:16:23,542 --> 00:16:26,208
Mother, I want to sleep.

231
00:16:30,167 --> 00:16:34,625
Once upon a time, a boy slept a lot.
Next day...

232
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:36,625
He died.

233
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:41,167
That is my mother's direct approach.

234
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,167
Her love for me is direct.

235
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:44,875
Her expectation of me is direct.

236
00:16:45,417 --> 00:16:46,875
For her, it is always...

237
00:16:47,042 --> 00:16:48,500
"no pain no gain".

238
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:11,500
But there are things that
simply cannot be gained.

239
00:17:13,042 --> 00:17:14,792
Days come and go.

240
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,917
Talking about Chow look-alike...

241
00:17:17,167 --> 00:17:18,875
You still think it's going to happen?

242
00:17:19,917 --> 00:17:20,875
When it comes to luck...

243
00:17:21,042 --> 00:17:23,750
The lottery numbers that
Mother obliges to draw...

244
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:27,875
Failed even to bring her one cent!

245
00:17:30,167 --> 00:17:31,458
As for being smart...

246
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:36,542
I did try hard, but then...

247
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:40,625
But then, I still have dreams.

248
00:17:41,208 --> 00:17:44,250
"My Ideal World"

249
00:17:44,292 --> 00:17:49,417
Maldives, a world outside our world.

250
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:56,375
The sky blue, clouds white,
the trees tall and water bright.

251
00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:00,875
The colourful world of the tropical sea.

252
00:18:01,042 --> 00:18:07,292
The primitive ocean of primitive energy.

253
00:18:07,458 --> 00:18:09,792
Experience a world that
knows no boundary!

254
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:13,333
Enjoy a trip to your ideal world.

255
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:20,250
Brilliant Touring Agency,
license no. 350999

256
00:18:22,792 --> 00:18:25,625
Mother, do you know where the Maldives is?

257
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:27,417
Far.

258
00:18:27,625 --> 00:18:28,708
How far?

259
00:18:28,917 --> 00:18:30,375
You need to fly there.

260
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:33,458
Mother will you take me there?

261
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:37,500
One day when I am rich.

262
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:40,125
When will you get rich?

263
00:18:41,875 --> 00:18:43,250
Soon...

264
00:18:43,417 --> 00:18:44,792
In my dream!

265
00:19:21,167 --> 00:19:23,833
Good morning, sir!

266
00:19:24,667 --> 00:19:28,000
Good day, sir!

267
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:32,083
Where is your favourite place?

268
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:35,708
My favourite place is Japan.

269
00:19:36,042 --> 00:19:39,208
They have Disneyland and
Hello Kitty Land.

270
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:43,583
I bought my hairpin there.

271
00:19:44,167 --> 00:19:47,083
My favourite place is Canada.

272
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:50,375
Grandma and my uncles live there.

273
00:19:50,958 --> 00:19:53,625
My favourite place is Bangkok.

274
00:19:53,792 --> 00:19:57,917
They have water sports and
shark's fin soup.

275
00:19:58,458 --> 00:20:01,292
My favourite place is that...

276
00:20:01,417 --> 00:20:03,000
What's-its-name.

277
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:06,667
They have Fun World and Food Mall.

278
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:09,917
Their chicken rice fills you up.

279
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:13,250
Right, that's Silver City Centre.

280
00:20:13,417 --> 00:20:17,250
They serve huge bowls of rice.

281
00:20:18,458 --> 00:20:22,875
As for the place I most want to go, wow!

282
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,917
There, the sky is blue,
clouds white, the trees tall...

283
00:20:28,042 --> 00:20:32,292
It is a world outside our world.

284
00:22:10,583 --> 00:22:13,458
Rise and shine, kiddo.

285
00:22:13,667 --> 00:22:14,667
Oh?

286
00:22:14,792 --> 00:22:16,958
Mother!

287
00:22:24,042 --> 00:22:26,125
Take some medicine and he'll be fine.

288
00:22:26,542 --> 00:22:29,250
After the medicine, will he need some other thing?

289
00:22:29,292 --> 00:22:30,625
No!

290
00:22:30,792 --> 00:22:32,125
So with the medicine, he won't need some other thing?

291
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:33,875
No! I'll give him a shot.

292
00:22:34,292 --> 00:22:36,333
A shot?

293
00:22:36,458 --> 00:22:38,917
He's scared of shots.

294
00:22:40,875 --> 00:22:43,167
Is he scared of dying?

295
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:41,958
How are you doing? Take the medicine.

296
00:23:42,125 --> 00:23:45,125
Mother, I don't want medicine.

297
00:23:45,292 --> 00:23:47,917
Please mother, no.

298
00:23:48,042 --> 00:23:50,458
I don't want the strawberry drink!

299
00:23:50,625 --> 00:23:53,583
You won't get well without the medicine.

300
00:23:53,708 --> 00:23:56,917
Sweetie, we will go to Maldives once
you get well.

301
00:23:57,542 --> 00:23:58,708
Really?

302
00:23:58,833 --> 00:24:00,625
Has Mother ever lied before?

303
00:24:01,125 --> 00:24:03,542
Now, drink up.

304
00:24:09,458 --> 00:24:11,875
Yes, Maldives!

305
00:24:12,292 --> 00:24:13,250
Maldives!

306
00:24:13,458 --> 00:24:14,417
Maldives!

307
00:24:14,542 --> 00:24:15,792
Maldives!

308
00:24:16,333 --> 00:24:19,083
Mother, when will we go?

309
00:24:19,792 --> 00:24:25,042
I will book the ticket once you get well.

310
00:24:26,125 --> 00:24:28,000
Come on, drink up!

311
00:24:45,917 --> 00:24:47,917
Look, mother!

312
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:53,708
Mother, I am well!

313
00:24:53,958 --> 00:24:56,000
I've taken all the medicine.

314
00:24:56,167 --> 00:24:58,667
But you've taken everything edible
at home.

315
00:24:58,833 --> 00:25:02,417
You see, the whole bottle was filled...

316
00:25:02,583 --> 00:25:05,750
And I gulped it down bit by bit...

317
00:25:06,042 --> 00:25:08,333
I did it!

318
00:25:14,083 --> 00:25:15,667
Now I am a good boy!

319
00:25:15,833 --> 00:25:18,167
Now I am not sick!

320
00:25:18,292 --> 00:25:19,167
Mother...

321
00:25:19,333 --> 00:25:20,375
What?

322
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,917
When are we going to Maldives?

323
00:25:23,083 --> 00:25:24,750
Maldives?

324
00:25:24,958 --> 00:25:28,417
You said we would go once I got well.

325
00:25:28,583 --> 00:25:31,958
Maldives, where the trees are tall and
water bright...

326
00:25:32,083 --> 00:25:35,167
The world outside our world!

327
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:38,667
Those words have flair.

328
00:25:38,833 --> 00:25:40,125
I am happy for you.

329
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:45,250
Mother, you promised...

330
00:25:45,458 --> 00:25:50,417
We'd go to Maldives once I got well.

331
00:25:50,583 --> 00:25:53,500
I meant once I get rich.

332
00:25:54,417 --> 00:25:58,708
No, that wasn't what you meant.

333
00:26:01,625 --> 00:26:06,083
You said we'd go once I got well.

334
00:26:07,042 --> 00:26:09,125
You promised!

335
00:26:09,958 --> 00:26:12,000
Now stop crying.

336
00:26:12,167 --> 00:26:13,708
We will go to Maldives.

337
00:26:13,875 --> 00:26:15,542
- Really? - Yes.

338
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:17,000
When?

339
00:26:17,167 --> 00:26:18,542
Once I get rich.

340
00:26:18,708 --> 00:26:20,167
But you are rich.

341
00:26:20,333 --> 00:26:22,042
Sure, sure, I am rich.

342
00:26:22,208 --> 00:26:23,500
We will go next week, OK?

343
00:26:23,625 --> 00:26:24,542
Bravo!

344
00:27:00,333 --> 00:27:03,917
This is McDull.

345
00:27:04,042 --> 00:27:06,167
Hey, I'm leaving tomorrow.

346
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:08,667
- Yes... - Is that right?

347
00:27:08,833 --> 00:27:10,292
The food on board is horrible?

348
00:27:10,417 --> 00:27:12,167
Be it so!

349
00:27:12,333 --> 00:27:14,417
We couldn't bring our own food, right?

350
00:27:14,542 --> 00:27:15,542
Still chatting away?

351
00:27:15,708 --> 00:27:18,208
You need to pack.

352
00:27:18,375 --> 00:27:22,625
Tell them I'm going to Maldives tomorrow.

353
00:27:22,833 --> 00:27:26,708
Where the trees are tall and water bright...

354
00:27:26,833 --> 00:27:27,917
Hey, you!

355
00:27:28,042 --> 00:27:29,500
Coming!

356
00:27:30,125 --> 00:27:33,417
I need to pack now. Talk to you later.

357
00:27:33,583 --> 00:27:35,125
See you!

358
00:27:44,667 --> 00:27:48,458
Mother, do I need to bring
my birth certificate?

359
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:49,458
I guess so.

360
00:27:49,583 --> 00:27:50,542
And school report?

361
00:27:50,667 --> 00:27:51,917
We don't need that.

362
00:27:52,083 --> 00:27:55,292
Wow, I'm saved!

363
00:28:05,292 --> 00:28:06,875
I found it!

364
00:28:07,042 --> 00:28:09,583
I found my birth certificate!

365
00:28:12,375 --> 00:28:20,917
Mother, you keep it and don't lose it...

366
00:28:21,083 --> 00:28:23,500
Or else we're stuck.

367
00:32:22,167 --> 00:32:24,875
Leave on the morning, return at night.

368
00:32:25,083 --> 00:32:27,292
Mother said that'd make things worthy.

369
00:32:27,417 --> 00:32:28,583
Hence...

370
00:32:28,917 --> 00:32:30,875
The most beautiful day
in my childhood experience...

371
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,875
Passed.

372
00:32:33,417 --> 00:32:35,958
Do you think paper is
a good chicken wrapper?

373
00:32:36,542 --> 00:32:37,875
Maybe.

374
00:32:38,583 --> 00:32:41,000
If only for one small piece.

375
00:33:06,042 --> 00:33:08,250
- Good night, Mother! - Good night!

376
00:33:46,542 --> 00:33:48,000
The Hong Kong...

377
00:33:48,125 --> 00:33:52,292
windsurfing athlete San San Li...

378
00:33:52,458 --> 00:33:55,667
has just won the first gold medal
in Hong Kong history!

379
00:33:55,833 --> 00:33:59,708
San San, when her win was confirmed...

380
00:33:59,833 --> 00:34:03,875
told reporters that her result...

381
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,667
helped prove that
Hong Kong athletes are horrible...

382
00:34:09,292 --> 00:34:13,708
Excuse me, it should be "honourable".

383
00:34:13,875 --> 00:34:18,875
Hong Kong athletes
are honourable athletes.

384
00:34:19,042 --> 00:34:21,000
End of special report.

385
00:34:25,042 --> 00:34:27,208
Then, mother seemed inspired.

386
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,500
Handsome, lucky, smart...

387
00:34:30,625 --> 00:34:32,458
So much for those plans.

388
00:34:32,958 --> 00:34:35,458
Now how about something physical?

389
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:36,917
"Looking for Logan"

390
00:34:36,958 --> 00:34:38,333
And so, while one dream lingers on...

391
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:40,667
Another one begins.

392
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,417
"aka: How Does a Calf Become a Calf?"

393
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:45,417
It's about the Calf!

394
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:47,583
I know it is not easy.

395
00:34:48,875 --> 00:34:51,583
I know it is not easy to find Logan.

396
00:34:52,875 --> 00:34:56,417
I know it is not easy for him to take me in.

397
00:34:59,708 --> 00:35:03,250
No matter how difficult this is...

398
00:35:03,417 --> 00:35:05,500
Logan will be my master!

399
00:35:05,833 --> 00:35:09,875
I shall get an Olympic medal!

400
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:26,250
Cheung Chau!

401
00:35:26,792 --> 00:35:31,250
You raised San San,
now you will raise me!

402
00:35:31,542 --> 00:35:34,542
When I receive my Olympic medal...

403
00:35:34,792 --> 00:35:38,375
I shall tell the world:

404
00:35:38,542 --> 00:35:42,083
HK athletes are honorable athletes!

405
00:35:49,792 --> 00:35:53,417
Cheung Chau, I finally made it here.

406
00:35:58,333 --> 00:36:05,583
I must kiss this holy land!

407
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:13,667
Kiddo, this is Lamma Island.

408
00:36:14,667 --> 00:36:19,542
Lamma Island?
Where Chow Yun Fat grew up?

409
00:36:29,708 --> 00:36:34,500
I came into hiding on this island...

410
00:36:35,292 --> 00:36:39,500
To stay away from the paparazzi.

411
00:36:39,667 --> 00:36:45,083
And so many kids came to seek me out.

412
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:47,833
So I came to live here.

413
00:36:48,208 --> 00:36:50,083
You want me to be your master?

414
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:51,917
Forget it!

415
00:36:52,250 --> 00:36:55,750
You city kids are all spoiled...

416
00:36:55,875 --> 00:36:57,708
Good for nothing!

417
00:36:57,833 --> 00:37:00,000
You want to get an Olympic medal too?

418
00:37:00,083 --> 00:37:02,000
Dream on!

419
00:37:05,333 --> 00:37:09,000
Kiddo, look!
