1
00:00:48,792 --> 00:00:51,125
就喺麦太快要临盆嘅时候
When Mrs. McBing was in labour…

2
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:54,000
有一个胶兜喺九龙上空飞过
A pan appeared in the sky.

3
00:00:55,042 --> 00:00:58,208
沿住荔枝角道直出大角咀道
It flied along Garden Street…

4
00:00:58,375 --> 00:01:04,750
经过好彩酒家再左转返出花园街乐园牛丸王对上⋯
Turned left, and stopped at the Beefball King.

5
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:06,958
都系唔好：
Correction:

6
00:01:07,083 --> 00:01:10,042
先去街市大楼嗰间妹记鱼腩粥嗰度
It first arrived at the Market Building…

7
00:01:10,333 --> 00:01:13,292
转下，转下⋯都系唔好：
Lingered a bit… Correction:

8
00:01:13,375 --> 00:01:18,458
都系出返去亚皆老街飞过火车桥右转入太平道
It flied over the railway, turned right…

9
00:01:18,583 --> 00:01:23,792
再右转抹返出去窝打老道向女人街方向飞下下⋯
And headed directly for the Bazaar.

10
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:25,708
飞下，飞下⋯
It flied on…

11
00:01:25,875 --> 00:01:29,042
最后胶兜飞咗入广华医院嘅候产房
At last coming into the maternity ward.

12
00:01:29,208 --> 00:01:32,500
亦即系麦太右边魂精对上⋯
There, on the right hand side of Mrs. McBing.

13
00:01:32,792 --> 00:01:35,083
都系唔好：左边魂精对上⋯
Correction: Left hand side.

14
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:37,708
转下，转下，转下噉⋯
The pan stayed.

15
00:01:38,167 --> 00:01:40,167
麦太认定呢个系异像
Mrs. McBing, convinced that this was a miracle,

16
00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:43,292
于是向魂精对上嘅胶兜许愿
Made a wish…

17
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:47,167
而脑入面亦即时出现咗快要出世个仔嘅样⋯
Thinking of her soon-to-be-born son.

18
00:01:47,333 --> 00:01:50,458
希望佢好聪明，读书好叻！
Please make him a clever and smart boy!

19
00:01:50,708 --> 00:01:53,833
胶兜对麦太嘅愿望似乎冇咩表示
The pan didn't seem to hear her words.

20
00:01:53,958 --> 00:01:56,167
于是佢对住胶兜补充噉话：
So Mrs. McBing amended her wish:

21
00:01:56,333 --> 00:01:58,875
或者读书唔叻，出嚟做嘢叻啦？
Or make him a smart businessman?

22
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,542
又或者呢⋯
Or maybe…

23
00:02:00,667 --> 00:02:02,542
又或者系好靓仔，好靓仔
Or make him really handsome.

24
00:02:02,708 --> 00:02:06,042
好似周润发，同埋梁朝伟咁靓仔！
As handsome as Chow Yun Fat or Tony Leung!

25
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:12,042
胶兜依然系噉喺度转，好似一啲应承嘅迹象都冇
The pan didn't respond.

26
00:02:12,167 --> 00:02:13,583
麦太一时心虚
Mrs. McBing, in panic…

27
00:02:13,792 --> 00:02:17,667
嗱嗱嗱喺胶兜未落地之前起过另外一个愿望：
Made a final amendment:

28
00:02:18,042 --> 00:02:21,708
就算唔系咁聪明同咁靓仔，只要福星高照
Her boy needed not to be smart or handsome

29
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:24,917
一世够运，乜嘢事都逢凶化㗎喇！
As long as luck be with him!

30
00:02:25,958 --> 00:02:29,542
佢靠自己有料解决啲嘢就梗系好啦
It's nice to depend on oneself…

31
00:02:29,667 --> 00:02:31,917
不过运气都好紧要㖞
But luck is essential still.

32
00:02:32,167 --> 00:02:35,500
虽然似梁朝伟周润发都行运定咗
Of course Chow and Leung are lucky guys…

33
00:02:36,292 --> 00:02:38,875
但系都要叻仔先得㗎！
But then they are smart too!

34
00:02:42,208 --> 00:02:44,542
最后，胶兜「嘀督」一声咁落地
Finally, the pan dropped to the floor…

35
00:02:44,708 --> 00:02:49,458
嘀督？嘀督㖞，即系应承啦
Mrs. McBing, believing her wish granted…

36
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:52,417
麦太心谂，今次冇死喇！
Thought that was magnificent!

37
00:02:52,583 --> 00:02:54,167
但你应承咗啲咩呢？
But what had the pan granted her?

38
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:57,375
叻仔？好运？
A smart boy? A lucky boy?

39
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,417
定系话似周润发啊？
Or a Chow look-alike?

40
00:03:00,667 --> 00:03:02,708
为咗纪念呢个赐福嘅胶兜
To commemorate this, Mrs. McBing…

41
00:03:03,208 --> 00:03:06,250
麦太决定将个仔嘅名叫做麦胶
Decided to name her son McNificent.

42
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:09,750
都系唔好，胶胶声，咁难听！
No! It's better to be humble!

43
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:11,958
不如叫麦兜啦！
I'll name him McDull!

44
00:03:12,167 --> 00:03:13,292
各位⋯
Dear all…

45
00:03:13,458 --> 00:03:16,208
我就系呢个差少少就叫做麦胶嘅小朋友⋯
I am the boy, no more McNificent…

46
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:18,542
麦兜！
I'm McDull!

47
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:43,375
"My School"

48
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:45,083
咦，麦太，咩唔见你一排
Oh dear,

49
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:47,083
个脚瓜囊粗咗咁多呀？
your calves have grown strong.

50
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:48,875
鬼咩，日日扑嚟扑去⋯
"I've been desperately…

51
00:04:49,042 --> 00:04:50,500
同我仔揾幼稚园吖嘛！
looking for a school!

52
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:52,667
点解唔试下好彩酒楼斜对面
Why not try the one…

53
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:54,667
旧中侨百货公司楼上嗰间⋯
at the Emporium?

54
00:04:54,792 --> 00:04:57,083
春田花花幼稚园呢？
The Spring Flower Kindergarten?

55
00:04:57,292 --> 00:04:59,833
就系坐落喺界限街同南昌街交界⋯
Yeah! The one at the junction…

56
00:05:00,042 --> 00:05:01,667
银城美食广场附近嗰间⋯
Right next to Silver City Food Mall.

57
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:03,833
春田花花幼稚园呀？
The Spring Flower Kindergarten!

58
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,208
系呀！深水埗地铁站口行过去唔使十分钟呀！
Only 10 minutes walk from the MTR Station!

59
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:11,625
春田花花幼稚园，师资优良⋯
Spring Flower Kindergarten, good environment…

60
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:14,208
仲系西人教英文添㗎！
With white teachers for English class!

61
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:16,125
咦，西人教英文？
White teachers for English class?

62
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:16,958
系呀！
Yeah!

63
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:22,417
春田花花，真系好多西人㗎！
Spring Flower offers white teachers!

64
00:05:31,292 --> 00:05:35,958
〝我只耳仔畀人烙到好痛⋯〞
"We are all happy children…"

65
00:05:36,042 --> 00:05:40,917
〝我日日都要望住个窗！〞
"We sing everyday!"

66
00:05:41,042 --> 00:05:45,625
〝我哋喺度学习，我哋一齐成长⋯〞
"We learn as we grow…"

67
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:50,792
〝我哋就系春天嘅花！〞
"We are the flowers of spring!"

68
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:54,083
呢个扮紧白兔猪样嘅小朋友⋯
This piggy kid in a rabbit outfit…

69
00:05:54,292 --> 00:05:58,625
即系横睇掂睇都唔似发哥或者伟仔嗰个呢⋯
Who doesn't look the least like Chow or Leung…

70
00:05:58,792 --> 00:06:01,167
就系我，麦兜
That's me, McDull.

71
00:06:02,292 --> 00:06:04,000
呢间就系我读嘅幼稚园
This is my kindergarten.

72
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:06,542
校长系潮州人
The headmaster came from the countryside…

73
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,875
可能仲系讲紧潮州话嘅
As a result, he speaks with an accent.

74
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:10,208
所以咁多年嚟⋯
For many years…

75
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:12,875
我其实唔系好知佢噏乜
I had difficulty hearing him.

76
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:17,833
蛋挞！　蛋挞！
- Tart!    - Tart!

77
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,583
荔芋火鸭礼！　荔芋火鸭礼！
- Duck dumpling!    - Duck dumpling!

78
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:29,792
唔好忘记校训九十七⋯　唔好忘记校训九十七⋯
- The 97 Rule…    - The 97 Rule…

79
00:06:29,958 --> 00:06:33,083
都唔可以忘记校训九十八！
Shall be replaced by the 98 Rule!

80
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:38,792
都唔可以忘记校训九十八！
Shall be replaced by the 98 Rule!

81
00:06:39,167 --> 00:06:40,667
各位同学⋯
Good, children!

82
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:43,208
今次早会系要同大家分享
We are sharing an important issue…

83
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:45,000
一个可重要嘅主题：
this morning:

84
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:48,417
小朋友，你哋今个月交咗学费咩呀？
Children, have you handed in the school fee?

85
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:50,792
交！
Yes!

86
00:06:50,958 --> 00:06:54,375
哎，好在！噉大家可以返去上堂喇
Great! Now move to class.

87
00:06:57,875 --> 00:07:00,417
你哋可能觉得呢间幼稚园好烂
You might conclude that this is a shabby school.

88
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:03,125
但系，对于我同埋我班同学仔嚟讲
But, for me and my mates…

89
00:07:03,708 --> 00:07:06,625
呢度系我哋最快乐，最美丽嘅乐园⋯
This is the most beautiful paradise!

90
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,000
⋯仲有一个好疼我哋
…Also, there is Miss Chan.

91
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:12,833
不过就有少少游魂嘅班主任Miss Chan
Who adores us in her absent-minded way.

92
00:07:13,917 --> 00:07:16,083
佢嘅志愿系做下一个王菲
Also, she is a Faye Wong wannabe.

93
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:18,708
或者系做下一个陈慧琳都得
Actually, Kelly Chan will do!

94
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:20,750
好喇，我哋而家开始点名

Oops!

00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:11,375

Have I missed anyone?

117
00:08:11,542 --> 00:08:13,458
麦兜！
McDull!

118
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:15,667
麦兜同学！
McDull!

119
00:08:16,667 --> 00:08:18,208
麦兜同学！
McDull!

120
00:08:18,708 --> 00:08:20,000
麦兜同学！
McDull!

121
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:22,167
麦唛呀，即系呢⋯
Hey, I don't understand…

122
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:23,625
妈妈啊，我个心总系印住印住⋯
I keep feeling that…

123
00:08:23,792 --> 00:08:27,625
好似有人嗌紧我个名噉嘅
Someone is calling me.

124
00:08:28,583 --> 00:08:30,500
你哋唔好以为我心散啊
Don't think that I've been daydreaming.

125
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:33,667
其实我系喺度思考紧一啲学术性嘅问题：
I was contemplating something academic:

126
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:36,917
点解橙叫「疴﹣烂﹣煮」呢？
How does this universe work?

127
00:08:37,542 --> 00:08:39,833
妈妈话食橙会通大便
I mean, I ate 6 oranges that morning…

128
00:08:40,042 --> 00:08:44,542
「疴」呢个我明白，但系「烂﹣煮」呢？
And my stomach wouldn't stop.

129
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:47,125
仲有呢个「芭﹣娜﹣娜」香蕉啊
Then I ate 3 bananas this morning.

130
00:08:47,292 --> 00:08:50,375
点解雨伞会叫做「暗﹣芭﹣娜﹣娜」呢？
Again my stomach wouldn't stop…

131
00:08:50,542 --> 00:08:52,958
嗱，我「暗」啦，噉我「暗」嗰条蕉
It just wouldn't stop!

132
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:57,083
至多会疴烂煮啫，点解会搞到落雨呢？
How are these two things related?

133
00:08:57,958 --> 00:09:00,500
呢个世界仲有好多嘢我谂唔明
There are so many things that I don't understand.

134
00:09:00,667 --> 00:09:02,292
不过我唔怕
But I am not afraid.

135
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,667
我谂，到我读完幼稚园
One day, when I finish kindergarten…

136
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:08,000
升埋小学，上到中学
I shall move up…

137
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:09,750
再入埋大学⋯
And get my degree.

138
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:11,167
等我大学毕业嗰阵
When I graduate from university, I know…

139
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,292
我谂我乜都会明白晒！
I shall understand everything!

140
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:14,583
到嗰阵⋯
And then …

141
00:09:15,125 --> 00:09:17,292
我买层楼畀我妈妈！
I will buy my mother a house!

142
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:24,125
喺幼稚园楼下，校长兼营嘅间茶餐厅
Our headmaster runs a tea stand…

143
00:09:24,292 --> 00:09:27,375
我哋一班同学仔放咗学都经常喺房餐
Which we kids frequent after class.

144
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:30,125
唔该，鱼蛋粗面啊　　冇粗面噃
- Fishball noodle, please.    - No noodle left.

145
00:09:30,417 --> 00:09:33,917
噉啊⋯要碗鱼蛋河粉啊　　冇鱼蛋噃
- Fishball rice noodle then.    - No fishball left.

146
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:37,792
噉啊⋯要金钱肚粗面啊　　冇粗面噃

00:22:34,292 --> 00:22:36,333
吓？要打针啊？
A shot?

292
00:22:36,458 --> 00:22:38,917
佢好怕打针㗎㖞
He's scared of shots.

293
00:22:40,875 --> 00:22:43,167
噉佢怕唔怕死呀？
Is he scared of dying?

294
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:41,958
冇嘢吖嘛？快啲食埋啲药水佢先啦！
How are you doing? Take the medicine.

295
00:23:42,125 --> 00:23:45,125
妈妈我唔想食药水呀
Mother, I don't want medicine.

296
00:23:45,292 --> 00:23:47,917
唔好呀妈妈，我唔食呀
Please mother, no.

297
00:23:48,042 --> 00:23:50,458
我唔食士多啤梨药水呀！
I don't want the strawberry drink!

298
00:23:50,625 --> 00:23:53,583
唔好喊啦，唔食药唔会好㗎
You won't get well without the medicine.

299
00:23:53,708 --> 00:23:56,917
乖乖啲，病好咗妈妈带你去马尔代夫
Sweetie, we will go to Maldives once you get well.

300
00:23:57,542 --> 00:23:58,708
真嘅？
Really?

301
00:23:58,833 --> 00:24:00,625
妈妈几时呃过你呀？
Has mother ever lied before?

302
00:24:01,125 --> 00:24:03,542
乖，食埋啲药水先啦
Now, drink up.

303
00:24:09,458 --> 00:24:11,875
嘻嘻，好嘢，马尔代夫！
Yes, Maldives!

304
00:24:12,292 --> 00:24:13,250
马尔代夫！
Maldives!

305
00:24:13,458 --> 00:24:14,417
马尔代夫！
Maldives!

306
00:24:14,542 --> 00:24:15,792
马尔代夫！
Maldives!

307
00:24:16,333 --> 00:24:19,083
妈妈，咁我哋几时去呀？
Mother, when will we go?

308
00:24:19,792 --> 00:24:25,042
嗯，你乖乖哋食埋啲药，好返晒啦我即刻订机票
I will book the ticket once you get well.

309
00:24:26,125 --> 00:24:28,000
嚟啦，食多更！
Come on, drink up!

310
00:24:45,917 --> 00:24:47,917
妈妈你睇！
Look, mother!

311
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:53,708
妈妈你睇，我好返喇！
Mother, I am well!

312
00:24:53,958 --> 00:24:56,000
啲药所以我全部食晒喇
I've taken all the medicine.

313
00:24:56,167 --> 00:24:58,667
即系间屋有乜嘢唔系畀你食晒㗎？
But you've taken everything edible at home.

314
00:24:58,833 --> 00:25:02,417
妈妈，呢次唔同㗎，本来咁大樽嘅
You see, the whole bottle was filled…

315
00:25:02,583 --> 00:25:05,750
我饮下一格，又一格，又一格⋯
And I gulped it down bit by bit…

316
00:25:06,042 --> 00:25:08,333
吓，咪我饮晒㖞！
I did it!

317
00:25:14,083 --> 00:25:15,667
饮晒就叻仔啦！
Now I am a good boy!

318
00:25:15,833 --> 00:25:18,167
饮晒就好返实啦！
Now I am not sick!

319
00:25:18,292 --> 00:25:19,167
妈妈⋯
Mother…

320
00:25:19,333 --> 00:25:20,375
乜嘢啊？
What?

321
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,917
我哋几时去马尔代夫啊？
When are we going to Maldives?

322
00:25:23,083 --> 00:25:24,750
乜嘢马尔代夫啊？
Maldives?

323
00:25:24,958 --> 00:25:28,417
呢，你话我返就同我去马尔代夫㗎嘛！
You said we would go once I got well.

324
00:25:28,583 --> 00:25:31,958
马尔代夫呢，椰林树影，水清沙幼⋯
Maldives, where the trees tall and water bright…

325
00:25:32,083 --> 00:25:35,167
座落于印度洋嘅世外桃源啦！
The world outside our world!

326
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:38,667
啊，估唔到你几好文采㗎噃
Those words have flair.

327
00:25:38,833 --> 00:25:40,125
讲得几好听啊！
I am happy for you.

328
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:45,250
妈妈我唔系讲喇㗎，又系你话嘅⋯
Mother, you promised…

329
00:25:45,458 --> 00:25:50,417
你话我病好咗之日就同我去马尔代夫㗎！你讲过㗎！
We'd go to Maldives once I got well.

330
00:25:50,583 --> 00:25:53,500
我话发咗先至同你去㗎
I meant once I get rich.

331
00:25:54,417 --> 00:25:58,708
唔系㖞，妈妈你话好咗就同我去㗎㖞
No, that wasn't what you meant.

332
00:26:01,625 --> 00:26:06,083
你明明讲过好返就同你去马尔代夫㗎㖞
You said we'd go once I got well.

333
00:26:07,042 --> 00:26:09,125
你讲过㗎！
You promised!

334
00:26:09,958 --> 00:26:12,000
得啦得啦，唔好喊啦
Now stop crying.

335
00:26:12,167 --> 00:26:13,708
同你去马尔代夫啦
We will go to Maldives.

336
00:26:13,875 --> 00:26:15,542
真嘅？　　系啊
- Really?    - Yes.

337
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:17,000
咁几时去啊？
When?

338
00:26:17,167 --> 00:26:18,542
等我发咗先啰
Once I get rich.

339
00:26:18,708 --> 00:26:20,167
你发咗㗎喇，你发咗㗎喇⋯
But you are rich.

340
00:26:20,333 --> 00:26:22,042
系喇系喇系喇，发咗喇
Sure, sure, I am rich.

341
00:26:22,208 --> 00:26:23,500
下个礼拜同你去啦，得未啊？
We will go next week, ok?

342
00:26:23,625 --> 00:26:24,542
好嘢！
Bravo!

343
00:27:00,333 --> 00:27:03,917
喂，麦唛啊，我系麦兜啊
This is McDull.

344
00:27:04,042 --> 00:27:06,167
即系呢，我明日就要飞喇
Hey, I'm leaving tomorrow.

345
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:08,667
系啊　　⋯系咩？
- Yes…    - Is that right?

346
00:27:08,833 --> 00:27:10,292
飞机餐好难食㗎？
The food on board is horrible?

347
00:27:10,417 --> 00:27:12,167
但点都要食㗎啦！
Be it so!

348
00:27:12,333 --> 00:27:14,417
唔通自己带嘢上去食咩？
We couldn't bring our own food, right?

349
00:27:14,542 --> 00:27:15,542
仲讲哦？
Still chatting away?

350
00:27:15,708 --> 00:27:18,208
快啲嚟执埋啲行李先啦哦
You need to pack.

351
00:27:18,375 --> 00:27:22,625
你帮我话畀佢哋知，我明日去马尔代夫喇
Tell them I'm going to Maldives tomorrow.

352
00:27:22,833 --> 00:27:26,708
嗰度蓝天白云，椰林树⋯
Where the trees tall and water bright…

353
00:27:26,833 --> 00:27:27,917
水清净沙有！
Hey, you!

354
00:27:28,042 --> 00:27:29,500
我嚟紧㗎喇！
Coming!

355
00:27:30,125 --> 00:27:33,417
我要执行李喇，返嚟先再同你倾过啦
I need to pack now. Talk to you later.

356
00:27:33,583 --> 00:27:35,125
拜拜！
See you!

357
00:27:44,667 --> 00:27:48,458
哎哟，妈妈，我系咪要带埋出世纸去㗎？
Mother, do I need to bring my birth certificate?

358
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:49,458
都要㗎
I guess so.

359
00:27:49,583 --> 00:27:50,542
咁成绩表呢？
And school report?

360
00:27:50,667 --> 00:27:51,917
成绩表又唔使
We don't need that.

361
00:27:52,083 --> 00:27:55,292
好嘢！吓得我啊！咁都好啲
Wow, I'm saved!

362
00:28:05,292 --> 00:28:06,875
揾到喇！
I found it!

363
00:28:07,042 --> 00:28:09,583
出世纸俾我揾返到喇！
I found my birth certificate!

364
00:28:12,375 --> 00:28:20,917
妈咪你帮我收好佢，唔好掉咗佢呀
Mother, you keep it and don't lose it…

365
00:28:21,083 --> 00:28:23,500
掉咗就去唔到㗎喇
Or else we're stuck.

366
00:32:22,167 --> 00:32:24,875
早机去，晚机返
Leave on the morning, return at night.

367
00:32:25,083 --> 00:32:27,292
妈妈话噉先最著数
Mother said that'd make things worthy.

368
00:32:27,417 --> 00:32:28,583
就系噉样⋯
Hence…

369
00:32:28,917 --> 00:32:30,875
我过咗我小时候最著数⋯
The most beautiful day in my childhood experience…

370
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,875
最完美嘅一日
Passed.

371
00:32:33,417 --> 00:32:35,958
噉你话，纸包唔包得住鸡呢？
Do you think paper is a good chicken wrapper?

372
00:32:36,542 --> 00:32:37,875
都得嘅⋯
Maybe.

373
00:32:38,583 --> 00:32:41,000
尤其系细细旧嗰啲
If only for one small piece.

374
00:33:06,042 --> 00:33:08,250
妈妈早唞！
- Goodnight, mother!    - Goodnight!

375
00:33:46,542 --> 00:33:48,000
啱啱收到消息
The Hong Kong…

376
00:33:48,125 --> 00:33:52,292
奥运滑浪风帆选手李丽珊以五场四胜嘅结果
windsurfing athlete San San Li…

377
00:33:52,458 --> 00:33:55,667
夺取香港历史上第一面奥运金牌！
Has just won the first gold medal in Hong Kong history!

378
00:33:55,833 --> 00:33:59,708
消息话李丽珊喺知道自己稳夺奥运金牌之后
San San, when confirmed her winning…

379
00:33:59,833 --> 00:34:03,875
好激动噉同在场嘅记者讲今次佢嘅成绩⋯
Told reporters that her result…

380
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,667
可以证明到香港嘅运动员唔系腊鸭！
Helps prove that Hong Kong athletes are horrible…

381
00:34:09,292 --> 00:34:13,708
各位对唔住，应该　　系垃圾，唔系腊鸭！
Excuse me, it should be "honourable".

382
00:34:13,875 --> 00:34:18,875
对唔住，应该系　　唔系垃圾，亦都唔系腊鸭！
Hong Kong athletes are honourable athletes.

383
00:34:19,042 --> 00:34:21,000
特别报告完毕
End of special report.

384
00:34:25,042 --> 00:34:27,208
咦，妈妈好似又有计噉噃
Then, mother seemed inspired.

385
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,500
靓仔，好运，叻仔呀⋯
Handsome, lucky, smart…

386
00:34:30,625 --> 00:34:32,458
睇嚟都唔多靠得住
So much for those plans.

387
00:34:32,958 --> 00:34:35,458
哗，好唔好靠下个手瓜噉呢？
Now how about something physical?

388
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:36,917
"Looking for Logan"

389
00:34:36,958 --> 00:34:38,333
于是，一个梦都未醒⋯
And so, while one dream lingers on…

390
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:40,667
我又得到另外一个梦
Another one begins.

391
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,417
"aka: How Does a Calf Become a Calf?"

392
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:45,417
系咪应该系脚瓜之争
It's about the Calf!

393
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:47,583
我知道一啲都唔容易
I know it is not easy.

394
00:34:48,875 --> 00:34:51,583
我知道要揾到黎根绝对唔容易
I know it is not easy to find Logan.

395
00:34:52,875 --> 00:34:56,417
我知道要佢收我做徒弟更加唔容易
I know it is not easy for him to take me in.

396
00:34:59,708 --> 00:35:03,250
但无论几唔容易，我都要试一试
No matter how difficult this is…

397
00:35:03,417 --> 00:35:05,500
我要黎根收我做徒弟！
Logan will be my master!

398
00:35:05,833 --> 00:35:09,875
无论几辛苦，我一定要攞到奥运金牌！
I shall get an Olympic medal!

399
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:26,250
长洲！长洲！
Cheung Chau!

400
00:35:26,792 --> 00:35:31,250
你孕育咗珊珊！你都会孕育我！
You raised San San, now you will raise me!

401
00:35:31,542 --> 00:35:34,542
当我企喺奥运会颁奖台上面
When I receive my Olympic medal…

402
00:35:34,792 --> 00:35:38,375
我会举起金牌同全世界讲：
I shall tell the world:

403
00:35:38,542 --> 00:35:42,083
香港运动员唔系垃圾！
HK athletes are honourable athletes!

404
00:35:49,792 --> 00:35:53,417
长洲，我终于嚟到长洲嘞！
Cheung Chau, I finally make it here.

405
00:35:58,333 --> 00:36:05,583
长洲，我要亲吻呢片圣洁嘅土地！
I must kiss this holy land!

406
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:13,667
小朋友呀，呢度系南丫岛噃！
Kiddo, this is Lamma Island.

407
00:36:14,667 --> 00:36:19,542
南丫岛？都孕育咗周润发噃！
Lamma Island? Where Chow Yun Fat grew up?

408
00:36:29,708 --> 00:36:34,500
真估唔到我黎根避入嚟南丫岛都畀你揾到
I came into hiding on this island…

409
00:36:35,292 --> 00:36:39,500
小朋友，我谂你都知道乜嘢叫做狗仔队嘞？
To stay away from the paparazzi.

410
00:36:39,667 --> 00:36:45,083
再加上不时有啲小朋友同埋家长嚟揾我话要拜我为师
And so many kids came to seek me out.

411
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:47,833
所以我咪过嚟南丫岛避一避
So I came to live here.

412
00:36:48,208 --> 00:36:50,083
至于拜师嘅嘢⋯
You want me to be your master?

413
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:51,917
拜你个头嘅！
Forget it!

414
00:36:52,250 --> 00:36:55,750
你哋呢班住喺香港岛嘅小朋友骄生惯养
You city kids are all spoiled…

415
00:36:55,875 --> 00:36:57,708
边挨得苦㗎？
Good for nothing!

416
00:36:57,833 --> 00:37:00,000
想学珊珊攞奥运金牌？
You want to get an Olympic medal too?

417
00:37:00,083 --> 00:37:02,000
醒梦你！
Dream on!

418
00:37:05,333 --> 00:37:09,000
小朋友，你睇下！
Kiddo, look!

419
00:37:15,375 --> 00:37:16,167
哗，呢只⋯
This calf…

420
00:37:16,333 --> 00:37:21,292
呢只脚瓜⋯好粗好大呀！仲大个节瓜呀！
So thick, so strong!

421
00:37:21,417 --> 00:37:23,667
脚瓜啲肌肉非常结实⋯
And so muscular!

422
00:37:23,875 --> 00:37:27,167
啲青筋凸晒出嚟，好似钢线噉
With steely veins running down…

423
00:37:27,625 --> 00:37:30,833
啲脚毛，每一条好似铁钉噉硬
Hair sticking out like wire…

424
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:35,042
脚趾公啲脚甲成吋噉厚，究竟⋯
And those tough toenails!

425
00:37:35,208 --> 00:37:36,667
要行过几多座山⋯
How many hills must it travel…

426
00:37:36,833 --> 00:37:38,208
跨过几多个海⋯
How many seas must it pass…

427
00:37:38,375 --> 00:37:39,792
挨过几多苦头⋯
How much pain must it bear…

428
00:37:39,917 --> 00:37:44,875
先至可以练成呢只举世无双嘅脚瓜？
Before a calf becomes a calf?

429
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:51,583
我⋯我一定要练成呢只脚瓜！
I shall have this calf!

430
00:37:51,875 --> 00:37:52,917
师父！
Master!

431
00:37:57,125 --> 00:37:59,667
我可唔可以去个小便呢？
Can I take a pee?

432
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:07,250
唔知点解每一次唱呢首歌都会急小便
Whenever I sing this song, I need to pee.

433
00:38:07,875 --> 00:38:11,375
今次去定先，都怕一阵会再急过
Taking a pee first would not help.

434
00:38:11,875 --> 00:38:14,542
但系我而家一定要唱呢首歌
But I must sing it now.

435
00:38:14,708 --> 00:38:17,708
希望可以改变黎根对我嘅睇法
With this song, I hope…

436
00:38:18,125 --> 00:38:20,333
我要用呢首歌打动黎根
Logan will think better of me.

437
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:22,958
我要黎根收我做徒弟！
Logan will be my master!

438
00:38:23,125 --> 00:38:25,917
嗰首歌，系噉唱嘅⋯
The song goes like this…

439
00:38:26,042 --> 00:38:27,542
「大包，整多两笼」
"Big bun, have two more…"

440
00:38:27,667 --> 00:38:29,417
「大包，整多两笼」
"Big bun, have two more…"

441
00:38:29,542 --> 00:38:33,250
「大包，整多两笼唔怕滞」
"Forget about indigestion."

442
00:38:33,375 --> 00:38:35,083
「大包，整多两笼」
"Big bun, have two more…"

443
00:38:35,208 --> 00:38:36,875
「大包，整多两笼」
"Big bun, have two more…"

444
00:38:37,042 --> 00:38:40,667
「大包，整多两笼唔怕滞」
"Forget about indigestion."

445
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,583
「大包，整多两笼」
"Big bun, have two more…"

446
00:38:42,708 --> 00:38:44,500
「大包，整多两笼」
"Big bun, have two more…"

447
00:38:44,667 --> 00:38:48,875
「大包，整多两笼唔怕滞」
"Forget about indigestion."

448
00:38:49,167 --> 00:38:54,333
「食晒个包，脚瓜大个」
"Eat the bun, grow a calf…"

449
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:57,542
「孝顺我阿妈」
"Respect my mother."

450
00:38:58,375 --> 00:39:03,750
「食晒个包，脚瓜硬朗」
"Eat the bun, toughen my calf…"

451
00:39:03,917 --> 00:39:07,333
「再奉献国家」
"Serve my country."

452
00:39:08,458 --> 00:39:10,000
「大包，整多两笼」
"Big bun, have two more…"

453
00:39:10,125 --> 00:39:11,875
「大包，整多两笼」
"Big bun, have two more…"

454
00:39:12,042 --> 00:39:15,500
「大包，整多两笼唔怕滞」
"Forget about indigestion."

455
00:39:15,708 --> 00:39:17,667
「大包，整多两笼」
"Big bun, have two more…"

456
00:39:17,792 --> 00:39:19,458
「大包，整多两笼」
"Big bun, have two more…"

457
00:39:19,625 --> 00:39:24,792
「大包，整多两笼唔怕滞」
"Forget about indigestion."

458
00:39:28,583 --> 00:39:32,875
黎根听完首歌之后，啲表情有啲古怪⋯
Logan looks strange after the song.

459
00:39:33,542 --> 00:39:36,958
我一定要好好把握呢个机会
I must grab my chance.

460
00:39:37,417 --> 00:39:39,833
师父！你收我做徒弟啦！
Master! Please be my master!

461
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,750
你唔收我做徒弟，我呢一世都跪喺度！
Or let me kneel here forever!

462
00:39:43,875 --> 00:39:46,042
起身啊！
Get up…

463
00:39:46,167 --> 00:39:47,250
多谢师父！
Thank you master!

464
00:39:47,417 --> 00:39:50,167
唔系啊⋯我系叫你扶我起身啊！
Silly, help me get up.

465
00:39:50,333 --> 00:39:57,875
顶唔顺啊！我个脚瓜太痹啊！
My calf has gone numb!

466
00:40:07,833 --> 00:40:10,917
我将今日发生嘅嘢话晒畀妈妈听
I tell mother what happened today.

467
00:40:11,625 --> 00:40:14,333
妈妈佢乜嘢都冇讲到
She won't say a word…

468
00:40:14,458 --> 00:40:18,250
喺冰箱度攞咗只雪鸡出嚟解冻
But starts to defreeze a chicken.

469
00:40:20,667 --> 00:40:24,500
晚饭时候，妈妈倒咗三杯米酒
At dinner, mother offers 3 glasses of wine…

470
00:40:24,833 --> 00:40:30,333
再将几只橙同埋蒸熟咗嘅鸡放喺祖先前面
Oranges and the chicken to the ancestral tablet.

471
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:34,250
妈妈叫我跪低，向祖先请请
Mother then tells me to kneel down.

472
00:40:34,667 --> 00:40:38,458
跟住，妈妈口噏噏噉讲咗一啲嘢
She mumbles something when…

473
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:44,292
然之后我哋又一齐对住祖先拜多几拜
We pay our respect to our ancestors.

474
00:40:45,708 --> 00:40:49,875
妈妈蹲低身将啲酒倒喺地上面
As mother pours the wine on the floor…

475
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,750
庄重又温柔紧同我讲：
She says in her solemn, tender voice:

476
00:40:52,875 --> 00:40:54,750
以后要生生性性
Be good,

477
00:40:55,208 --> 00:40:58,667
跟师父学嘢，光宗耀祖！
learn with the master and honour the ancestors.

478
00:41:05,625 --> 00:41:10,083
妈妈喺长洲揾咗间酒楼摆咗几回拜师宴
In honour of my master, mother throws a banquet.

479
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,583
因为我系师父最后一个入室弟子
As I am the last disciple of the master…

480
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:18,125
所以到贺嘅乡绅父老特别多
Everyone on Cheung Chau comes.

481
00:41:18,792 --> 00:41:21,333
估唔到黄德森都有嚟饮
San San's lover thinks…

482
00:41:21,542 --> 00:41:24,083
仲赞我背脊啲肉厚添
I have a nice thick back.

483
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:28,292
但系珊珊就去咗集训，冇嚟到
San San is in training and couldn't come.

484
00:41:28,458 --> 00:41:31,333
麦唛，菇时同得巴都嚟咗
All my mates are there too…

485
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:35,292
仲带埋成绩表，奖牌同大包嚟添
Bringing school report, medals and big buns.

486
00:41:35,708 --> 00:41:39,875
佢哋都希望黎根可以收埋佢哋做徒弟
They hope Logan will take them in also.

487
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,542
食完鸡丝翅，就到咗拜师仪式
After the soup, the ceremony begins.

488
00:41:44,708 --> 00:41:49,292
妈妈斟咗杯热茶畀我，叫我畀师傅饮
Mother pours a cup of tea and I offer it to the master.

489
00:41:49,458 --> 00:41:53,125
哦，我千辛万苦嚟到长洲揾黎根⋯
After all the hardship looking for Logan…

490
00:41:53,250 --> 00:41:58,208
哦，我终于可以同珊珊一齐练习滑浪风帆啊！
Now I can windsurf together with San San!

491
00:42:00,958 --> 00:42:04,458
我将杯茶递咗畀黎根，黎根佢⋯
I offer the tea to Logan…

492
00:42:05,167 --> 00:42:10,292
师父佢饮咗杯茶，正式收咗我做徒弟嘞
He drinks the tea and becomes my master.

493
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,917
啲来宾睇嚟好高兴
All the guests look happy.

494
00:42:13,042 --> 00:42:17,833
特别系长洲啲乡绅父老拍掌拍得特别落力
And everyone from Cheung Chau applauds.

495
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:21,833
多谢各位赏面！多谢各位！
Thank you for honouring me!

496
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,875
在下平生有两项称得上得意嘅绝技
In my life, I have two skills that I'm proud of.

497
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,958
第一样，系滑浪风帆！呢样早已
One is windsurfing.

498
00:42:29,083 --> 00:42:32,875
传咗畀我外甥女珊珊啊
That I have passed onto San San.

499
00:42:33,042 --> 00:42:37,708
另一项绝技，我打算传畀呢个新修嘅徒弟⋯
The other, I shall pass onto my new disciple…

500
00:42:37,875 --> 00:42:41,958
希望我可以将我哋长洲人世世代代嘅传统
Let him show the world…

501
00:42:42,083 --> 00:42:44,458
发扬光大！
what a marvelous skill that is!

502
00:42:46,292 --> 00:42:48,583
噉请问嗰样绝技系乜嘢啊？
Can you tell us what skill is that?

503
00:42:55,958 --> 00:42:59,083
第二样绝技，就系⋯
That is…

504
00:42:59,542 --> 00:43:02,333
抢包山！
Bun snatching!

505
00:43:08,792 --> 00:43:10,750
抢包山？
Bun snatching?

506
00:43:12,292 --> 00:43:15,542
年轻嘅观众可能唔知乜嘢系「抢包山」呀
"Bun Snatching", for our uninformed audience…

507
00:43:16,292 --> 00:43:19,833
抢包山系长洲独有嘅传统节日
Is a unique Cheung Chau tradition.

508
00:43:20,625 --> 00:43:22,167
每年农历四月
Each year, in the fourth month,

509
00:43:22,333 --> 00:43:25,125
长洲嘅居民都会举办太平清醮
Cheung Chau people…

510
00:43:25,958 --> 00:43:28,667
喺北帝庙前搭起三座包山
Set up 3 stacks of bun to celebrate.

511
00:43:29,750 --> 00:43:31,333
噉乜嘢系包山呢？
Stacks of bun?

512
00:43:31,792 --> 00:43:32,875
顾名思义⋯
Literally speaking…

513
00:43:33,083 --> 00:43:38,375
包山就系一座由好多好多好多包砌起嘅山！
A stack of bun is a stack of many buns!

514
00:43:38,750 --> 00:43:41,958
一座包山，起码六、七层楼高⋯
Each stack coming up to 6, 7 storeys.

515
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:46,208
噉你可以想像一下嗰度有几多包喇？
Imagine how high that is.

516
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:51,875
噉抢包山，自然就系要将包山嘅包抢到手！
Bun snatching is to snatch those buns!

517
00:43:52,542 --> 00:43:53,917
锣鼓响起
When the time comes,

518
00:43:54,125 --> 00:43:58,167
数以百计嘅青年就会一涌而上去抢包
hundreds of youth would rush up…

519
00:43:58,292 --> 00:44:02,292
抢到位置越高嘅包，就代表越大嘅祝福
The higher the bun you snatch, the more blessed you are.

520
00:44:02,417 --> 00:44:05,833
更加可以表现自己不凡嘅身手
And the more praise you get.

521
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:11,792
但喺1978年两座包山突然塌咗，多人重伤
In 1978, 2 stacks tumbled down, hurting many.

522
00:44:11,958 --> 00:44:14,417
「抢包山」从此被禁！
"Bun Snatching" was thus banned!

523
00:44:14,583 --> 00:44:18,583
长洲特有嘅传统，亦渐被遗忘
And the unique tradition is lost.

524
00:44:22,167 --> 00:44:26,125
奥运金牌⋯我谂呢一世都唔会攞到
The Olympic medal… it has slipped away.

525
00:44:26,833 --> 00:44:30,250
每个礼拜六我都会搭船过长洲
Every Saturday, I'd take a ferry to Cheung Chau…

526
00:44:30,583 --> 00:44:32,375
去学抢包山⋯
to practice bun snatching.

527
00:44:32,583 --> 00:44:36,125
一项冇奖牌，冇对手，冇比赛⋯
A game with no medal, no competitor, no competition…

528
00:44:36,542 --> 00:44:39,958
甚至乎冇人知道佢系运动嘅运动
A game nobody knows of.

529
00:44:41,292 --> 00:44:44,583
更衰嘅系，连包山都冇！
A game with no bun to snatch!

530
00:44:45,583 --> 00:44:48,208
师傅净系叫我去佢屋企⋯
All I do is to go to the master's home…

531
00:44:48,417 --> 00:44:51,000
喺个组合柜度爬嚟爬去
and crawl around the shelf.

532
00:44:52,375 --> 00:44:55,417
碰！三番！
My win!

533
00:44:55,583 --> 00:44:58,208
冇偷懒！继续练！
Keep going, lazy bone!

534
00:45:00,833 --> 00:45:04,250
有一日，珊珊嚟咗师傅屋企！
One day, San San arrives!

535
00:45:04,375 --> 00:45:06,875
珊珊！我个师姐珊珊啊！
San San, my idol!

536
00:45:07,042 --> 00:45:08,333
可以见到珊珊⋯
Seeing San San…

537
00:45:08,458 --> 00:45:11,583
爬得咁辛苦都系值得㗎！
Makes me forget all these weeks' hard work.

538
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:13,792
珊珊！
San San!

539
00:45:13,958 --> 00:45:16,125
珊你个头啊！继续练习！
San yourself! Work!

540
00:45:24,083 --> 00:45:25,375
仲唔去？
You hear me?

541
00:45:26,417 --> 00:45:29,333
珊珊佢见唔到我呢个师弟
So San San leaves without seeing me.

542
00:45:29,667 --> 00:45:33,667
我唯有死死气爬返上个组合柜
In despair, I crawl up the shelf.

543
00:45:35,167 --> 00:45:39,458
我咁大个仔，乜嘢「头」都畀人闹过⋯
I have had a lot of things said to me…

544
00:45:39,708 --> 00:45:41,770
但系「珊你个头」唔知点解特别刺耳
but "San yourself"…

545
00:45:41,770 --> 00:45:43,833
但系「珊你个头」唔知点解特别刺耳
hurts like never before.

546
00:45:43,958 --> 00:45:45,333
我⋯我⋯
I… I…

547
00:45:45,417 --> 00:45:48,083
我唔学抢包山嘞！
I am quitting!

548
00:46:10,708 --> 00:46:15,083
其实今日系我第一次咁近距离同丽根见面
Today is the first time I sit down with Logan.

549
00:46:15,750 --> 00:46:18,083
睇怕佢都有五十岁啦
He must be around 50,

550
00:46:18,208 --> 00:46:20,208
但系仲有副孩子脸
with a baby face.

551
00:46:20,333 --> 00:46:22,208
鸡尾包！啱啱出炉嘅！
Fresh from the oven!

552
00:46:25,667 --> 00:46:27,750
其实鸡尾包呢⋯
This thing…

553
00:46:28,333 --> 00:46:31,167
吓，你话噉样似唔似鸡尾呀？哈哈哈哈
What does it look like?

554
00:46:36,917 --> 00:46:39,500
麦兜嘅学嘢呢⋯都仲可以
Dull… he's not a bad student.

555
00:46:39,667 --> 00:46:42,125
跟住黎根讲咗一大堆说话⋯
Logan then proceeds to tell me a lot…

556
00:46:42,583 --> 00:46:46,208
讲下佢嘅抱负，佢对麦兜嘅期望
His ambition, his expectation of Dull.

557
00:46:46,583 --> 00:46:51,125
佢话会将佢识嘅嘢毫无保留噉教晒畀麦兜
He says he'll teach all he knows to Dull.

558
00:46:51,708 --> 00:46:53,708
黎根越讲越兴奋
The more he talks, the more excited he gets.

559
00:46:53,792 --> 00:46:57,167
佢话滑浪风帆都唔系佢最犀利嗰样
He tells me windsurfing is not his strongest.

560
00:46:57,417 --> 00:47:00,250
佢最劲嘅就系抢包山
His strongest is really bun snatching…

561
00:47:00,833 --> 00:47:03,625
佢话抢包山结合咗南拳
Something combining Fist,

562
00:47:03,750 --> 00:47:06,458
神功戏同现代器械操
ritual and gymnastic.

563
00:47:06,750 --> 00:47:11,500
佢话抢包山先至系佢呢世人最大嘅成就
He says bun snatching is his lifelong achievement.

564
00:47:11,625 --> 00:47:13,542
缩嗰只脚，唔该！
Move your feet!

565
00:47:15,625 --> 00:47:17,333
你睇下！
Look!

566
00:47:18,875 --> 00:47:24,542
哗，呢节⋯呢节脚瓜好粗好大呀！仲大过节瓜！
This calf… so thick, so strong!

567
00:47:24,708 --> 00:47:26,667
脚瓜嘅肌肉非常结实⋯
And so muscular!

568
00:47:26,833 --> 00:47:30,125
啲青筋凸晒出嚟，好似钢线噉
With steely veins running down…

569
00:47:30,708 --> 00:47:33,875
啲脚毛每一条都好似铁钉咁硬
Hair sticking out like wire…

570
00:47:34,042 --> 00:47:37,875
脚趾公啲脚甲成寸咁厚，究竟⋯
And those tough toenails!

571
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,667
要行过几多座山?
How many hills must it travel…

572
00:47:39,792 --> 00:47:41,625
跨过几多个海
How many seas must it pass…

573
00:47:41,750 --> 00:47:43,125
挨过几多苦头
How much pain must it bear…

574
00:47:43,208 --> 00:47:47,500
先至可以练成呢一只举世无双嘅脚瓜？
Before a calf becomes a calf?

575
00:47:53,292 --> 00:47:54,000
我个仔⋯
My son…

576
00:47:54,125 --> 00:47:57,750
你个仔，第时都会有咁大只脚瓜
Your son, he will get this calf.

577
00:47:58,042 --> 00:48:01,583
其实我都唔知我仔要咁粗嘅脚瓜⋯
I have no idea why would Dull need…

578
00:48:01,708 --> 00:48:02,958
有咩用
such a calf.

579
00:48:03,125 --> 00:48:07,542
但系见到佢一条条凸起嘅青筋，唔知点解⋯
But, looking at those steely veins…

580
00:48:08,042 --> 00:48:12,542
我⋯我谂起麦兜嘅爸爸，阿炳
I am reminded of Dull's pa, Bing.

581
00:48:21,042 --> 00:48:26,375
我揾完成间屋都揾唔到部电子英文词典
The electronic dictionary cannot be found.

582
00:48:26,542 --> 00:48:28,000
去咗边呢？
Where could it be?

583
00:48:28,125 --> 00:48:31,792
唔通⋯冇理由㗎？
Could it be that… ?

584
00:48:36,750 --> 00:48:40,875
咦，估唔到真系妈妈攞咗㖞。吓得我啊！
So mother has been using the dictionary?

585
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,958
点解妈妈会用英文写信嘅？
But why is she writing in English?

586
00:48:44,417 --> 00:48:45,583
封信好短
The letter is short.

587
00:48:45,708 --> 00:48:52,042
我谂妈妈佢系好辛苦用电子词典逐个逐个字译做英文
Mother must have translated it word by word.

588
00:48:52,167 --> 00:48:57,125
于是我用返电子词典将封信译返做中文
I use the machine to turn it back into Chinese.

589
00:48:58,083 --> 00:49:03,000
封信，原来系妈妈写畀奥委会主席㗎
It is addressed to the Olympic Committee Chairman.

590
00:49:04,667 --> 00:49:06,083
「亲爱的主席：」
"Dear Chairman:"

591
00:49:06,250 --> 00:49:08,500
「你好吗？我很好！」
"How are you? I am fine."

592
00:49:08,667 --> 00:49:10,917
「你吃包吗？我吃包！」
"You like bun? I like bun!"

593
00:49:11,083 --> 00:49:15,292
「我们居住在香港这里的人，很爱吃包」
"We Hong Kong people here love bun."

594
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:19,917
「小笼包，上海包，广东包，莲蓉包」
"Buns of all sorts."

595
00:49:20,042 --> 00:49:22,125
「好朋友，我认为
"Dear friend,"

596
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:25,125
抢劫那些包，十分重要」
"It is important to snatch buns."

597
00:49:25,250 --> 00:49:27,708
「也算是运动，就真！」
"It is a game, no joke."

598
00:49:27,958 --> 00:49:32,500
「要大力！大吃晚上的粥，和大节瓜！」
"One needs energy, and many night congee."

599
00:49:32,667 --> 00:49:34,708
「按照我愚蠢的见解⋯」
"In my stupid opinion…"

600
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:38,958
「抢劫嗰些包，系奥运会比赛」
"Snatching bun is an Olympic game."

601
00:49:39,083 --> 00:49:41,958
「让全世界嘅体育家，抢过！」
"Let athletes all over the world snatch!"

602
00:49:42,125 --> 00:49:43,833
「世界便和平！」
"And there will be peace."

603
00:49:44,167 --> 00:49:45,667
「你有孩子吗？」
"Do you have children?"

604
00:49:45,792 --> 00:49:48,417
「我有一个孩子，麦兜」
"I have a boy, Dull."

605
00:49:48,750 --> 00:49:50,167
终于讲到我啦！
She's talking about me!

606
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:54,125
「他是一个好男孩」
"He is a good boy."

607
00:49:54,292 --> 00:49:56,708
「他非常懂得抢劫那些包」
"He knows how to snatch buns."

608
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,792
「有一天，我看见他，抢劫包⋯」
"One day, I can see him snatching buns…"

609
00:50:00,083 --> 00:50:02,292
「抢了一个奥运金牌」
"Ending up snatching an Olympic medal."

610
00:50:02,583 --> 00:50:06,792
「哪便是一个母亲能够有的最好的最大的安慰」
"That is the biggest comfort a mother can get."

611
00:50:07,292 --> 00:50:11,167
「孩子的才干，得到了世界人类的知道」
"Let the world know the talent of your children."

612
00:50:11,833 --> 00:50:15,167
「父母愿意做什么的东西都得」
"Parents will do anything for that."

613
00:50:15,667 --> 00:50:19,333
「于是我写了这忽然间的信给你」
"That is why I write you this sudden letter."

614
00:50:19,542 --> 00:50:23,333
「虽然你不知道我是什么微细的东西」
"Although you don't know humble things like me."

615
00:50:23,625 --> 00:50:26,500
「但我的孩子很大，很大！」
"But my boy is big, very big."

616
00:50:26,667 --> 00:50:29,125
「有一天，你都会知道」
"One day, you will know him too."

617
00:50:29,875 --> 00:50:31,250
「多谢合作！」
"Thank you for your cooperation."

618
00:50:31,583 --> 00:50:34,917
「你忠实的，麦太」
"Yours faithfully, Mrs. Mc."

619
00:50:42,375 --> 00:50:43,833
睇完妈妈封信后
After reading mother's letter…

620
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:47,000
我决定返长洲继续捡包山
I go back to Cheung Chau to practice.

621
00:50:48,417 --> 00:50:50,458
我唔系为咗见珊珊
Not because of San San.

622
00:50:50,958 --> 00:50:53,042
我唔知点解要抢嗰啲包
I don't know why I want to snatch a bun.

623
00:50:53,667 --> 00:50:57,042
我亦唔信抢包山会成为奥运项目
And I don't think it will ever become an Olympic sport.

624
00:50:57,708 --> 00:51:01,042
但系，我依然努力练习抢包山
But I keep learning.

625
00:51:01,625 --> 00:51:04,125
因为，我爱我妈妈
Because I love my mother.

626
00:51:05,542 --> 00:51:08,958
师傅话我嘅攀爬功夫已经唔错
Master thinks my crawling has passed.

627
00:51:09,458 --> 00:51:12,583
可以开始教我「十二路抢包手」
Now I'll learn the "12 Bun Snatching Hands".

628
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:16,042
师傅话当年师祖要出呢套
Master says these 12 hands,

629
00:51:16,167 --> 00:51:17,958
「十二路抢包手」⋯
in its prime…

630
00:51:18,125 --> 00:51:21,042
连林世荣睇见都大赞好
Was much admired by Butcher Lin!

631
00:51:22,167 --> 00:51:24,000
后来麦唛话我知⋯
Later, I learn from McMug…

632
00:51:24,167 --> 00:51:28,375
林世荣即系猪肉荣，系黄飞鸿嘅徒弟
Butcher Lin was a disciple of the great Kung Fu king.

633
00:51:29,458 --> 00:51:32,458
我唔知到师傅似唔似黄飞鸿
I don't know much about Kung Fu kings…

634
00:51:32,833 --> 00:51:35,542
但系我就肯定似旧猪肉
But I must be the ultimate pork…

635
00:51:35,708 --> 00:51:37,708
我就系一个揸住两个包
The pork that struts about

636
00:51:37,833 --> 00:51:40,458
喺长洲转嚟转去嘅猪肉
with buns in hands.

637
00:51:41,458 --> 00:51:46,000
我一边练习，一边乱练，一边谂嘢；始终⋯
My mind boggles as I practice, after all…

638
00:51:46,167 --> 00:51:48,458
我都唔系咁钟意抢包
I am not a fan of bun snatching.

639
00:51:48,917 --> 00:51:50,750
我净系爱我妈妈
I am only doing this for mother.

640
00:51:50,875 --> 00:51:52,667
于是我咬实牙根⋯
Hence I hang on…

641
00:51:52,792 --> 00:51:55,000
一步一步，一爪一爪⋯
Step by step, claw by claw…

642
00:51:55,167 --> 00:51:59,833
最后我终于练成「十二路抢包手」啦
I make it pass the "12 Bun Snatching Hands".

643
00:52:10,208 --> 00:52:20,625
"There is no deformity, but saves us from a dream"

644
00:52:21,208 --> 00:52:23,750
喂，我系麦兜啊
This is Dull.

645
00:52:23,833 --> 00:52:27,833
正话嗰个系细路仔麦兜，我系大个佬麦兜
Dull the big guy, not Dull the boy.

646
00:52:28,167 --> 00:52:31,667
细路仔麦兜同大个佬麦兜除咗把声唔同之外⋯
The two Dulls have different voices, and then…

647
00:52:32,167 --> 00:52:35,792
细路仔麦兜嘅世界仲有好多幻想
Dull the boy's world is still filled with fantasy…

648
00:52:36,583 --> 00:52:38,125
仲有好多希望
Filled with hopes.

649
00:52:38,583 --> 00:52:40,667
希望⋯失望⋯
Hope… Disappointment…

650
00:52:40,833 --> 00:52:42,250
希望⋯
Hope…

651
00:52:42,333 --> 00:52:43,625
失望
Disappointment.

652
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,167
搞咗一轮，就变咗大个佬麦兜
On and on, he became Dull the big guy.

653
00:52:47,292 --> 00:52:50,542
不过，而家我都系想讲返细路仔麦兜
But I shall tell more about Dull the boy.

654
00:52:51,125 --> 00:52:53,625
细路仔麦兜仲系希望希望⋯
Dull the boy hoped a lot.

655
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:56,417
希望真系有圣诞老人
He hoped there WAS a Santa Claus.

656
00:52:56,583 --> 00:53:00,042
仲系好想好想试下圣诞火鸡嘅滋味
And he hoped to eat a Christmas turkey.

657
00:53:00,833 --> 00:53:03,958
系啊，我嗰阵我真系仲未食过火鸡
Right, I haven't eaten any turkey then.

658
00:53:04,250 --> 00:53:05,875
所有关于火鸡嘅嘢⋯
Everything about turkey…

659
00:53:06,333 --> 00:53:08,417
圣诞树一闪一闪嘅灯饰
The sparkling tinkling Christmas tree…

660
00:53:08,708 --> 00:53:11,042
就好似喺天上面落嚟嘅星星噉
Like stars falling from the sky…

661
00:53:11,250 --> 00:53:13,208
落喺火炉旁边
Coming down by the fireplace.

662
00:53:14,208 --> 00:53:17,667
一片一片比窗外面嘅雪仲要白嘅鸡胸肉⋯
Each slice of meat looks purer than snow.

663
00:53:18,083 --> 00:53:19,708
就喺我哋面前啦
Right in front of us…

664
00:53:20,458 --> 00:53:21,833
香气直入灵魂⋯
The aroma attacks our soul…

665
00:53:22,042 --> 00:53:25,292
就连守喺灵魂旁边嘅天使都醒咗起嚟
Waking even the guardian angels.

666
00:53:25,542 --> 00:53:28,750
围住呢一嚿好香好香又好圣洁嘅肉⋯
Who float around the aromatic and holy dish…

667
00:53:29,417 --> 00:53:34,042
喺圣诞夜里面飞呀，飞呀⋯
Floating in the Christmas night, floating…

668
00:53:35,292 --> 00:53:39,917
但系呢一切一切关于火鸡嘅嘢，都不过系我嘅想像
All this about turkey was only my imagination.

669
00:53:40,125 --> 00:53:42,417
因为我从来都未食过火鸡⋯
I had never eaten a turkey.

670
00:53:42,625 --> 00:53:44,667
就连嗰阵味都未闻过
I had never even smelt one.

671
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:47,125
妈妈话火鸡太大
Mother claimed turkey was too big.

672
00:53:47,708 --> 00:53:50,083
我哋一家两口，点食都食唔晒
The two of us would never finish it.

673
00:53:50,417 --> 00:53:54,208
有一年圣诞节妈妈买咗半边烧鸭庆祝
One Christmas we celebrated with roast duck.

674
00:53:54,417 --> 00:53:56,792
当时我，真系十分十分之失望
I was really, really disappointed.

675
00:53:57,792 --> 00:54:00,333
又有一年，有间大百货公司倒闭
Another year, she bought a mini-oven at 60% off…

676
00:54:00,875 --> 00:54:03,833
妈妈用四折买咗个焗炉仔返屋企
At a closedown sale.

677
00:54:04,250 --> 00:54:06,500
可能系因为买咗焗炉而技痒
Thanks to the oven…

678
00:54:06,917 --> 00:54:08,292
嗰日妈妈竟然同我讲⋯佢话⋯
Mother decided one day…

679
00:54:08,417 --> 00:54:11,458
明日我哋要超级市场揪火鸡
We would go shopping for a turkey.

680
00:54:12,333 --> 00:54:14,917
我同妈妈揪住只火鸡行返屋企嗰阵，喺嗰阵时⋯
On the way home, with turkey in hand…

681
00:54:15,333 --> 00:54:18,667
我谂系我生命里面最开心嘅一刻
That was the happiest moment in my life.

682
00:54:20,292 --> 00:54:22,000
火鸡终于解冻啦
The turkey was ready.

683
00:54:22,208 --> 00:54:24,542
我同妈妈，噉双手查满盐⋯
Following mother, with salt on both hands…

684
00:54:25,083 --> 00:54:28,292
喺火鸡丰厚嘅鸡胸度，起势噉擦呀擦
I rubbed the turkey's thick chest.

685
00:54:29,125 --> 00:54:30,000
联火鸡时⋯
When sewing up…

686
00:54:30,042 --> 00:54:33,750
妈妈一个唔觉意畀酿喺火鸡里面嘅洋葱粒漏咗出嚟
Some of the stuffing…

687
00:54:33,875 --> 00:54:35,333
红萝卜粒
leaked out.

688
00:54:35,708 --> 00:54:37,333
我话：火鸡「疴烂煮」呀！
I cried: the turkey's stomach won't stop!

689
00:54:39,042 --> 00:54:41,333
火鸡好勉强塞咗入焗炉度
We managed to stuff the turkey into the oven.

690
00:54:42,042 --> 00:54:43,500
12月24日
24th, December

691
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:47,625
上升嘅白烟同奇异嘅焦味拨动星星
Rising smoke stirred the stars with a crunchy smell.

692
00:54:48,417 --> 00:54:51,583
个焗炉戚戚恻恻，戚戚恻恻⋯
The oven hummed. Hummed.

693
00:54:52,167 --> 00:54:54,875
就好似天使预早畀我哋嘅福音
It was like early blessing from the angels.

694
00:55:03,625 --> 00:55:05,250
好靓嘅夜晚呀！
Such a beautiful night!

695
00:55:05,542 --> 00:55:07,583
我同妈妈坐喺尖东海旁
Mother and I sat at the seafront.

696
00:55:08,250 --> 00:55:12,042
点点点点嘅灯光喺海上面走来走去⋯
Lights shimmered on the sea.

697
00:55:12,542 --> 00:55:14,958
又靓又温柔
Beautiful and gentle.

698
00:55:16,208 --> 00:55:18,000
真系好靓！
So beautiful!

699
00:55:48,042 --> 00:55:50,125
我从未食过咁浓味嘅嘢
I had never tasted anything so strong.

700
00:55:50,417 --> 00:55:53,625
连烧鸭连杯面都冇咁浓嘅味道
Cup noodles or roast duck were not as strong.

701
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:57,333
火鸡嘅味道喺我嘅每一个味蕾度缠住⋯
The taste embedded every single taste bud…

702
00:55:58,250 --> 00:56:02,167
爆发⋯缠住⋯爆发⋯
Then exploded.

703
00:56:02,333 --> 00:56:03,958
就好似今晚嘅嘢噉
Like everything tonight…

704
00:56:04,458 --> 00:56:10,542
最靓最靓，最犀利，亦都系最温柔
Most beautiful, brilliant, and tender.

705
00:56:16,333 --> 00:56:18,125
第二日我瞓到好晏⋯
I woke up late the next day.

706
00:56:18,417 --> 00:56:21,667
刷完牙我仲感觉到火鸡嘅美味
The sweetness was still there after washing.

707
00:56:22,333 --> 00:56:23,625
因为早餐食得晏⋯
As we had a late breakfast…

708
00:56:24,125 --> 00:56:27,583
午餐妈妈净系整咗罐粟米汤畀我
There was only corn soup for lunch.

709
00:56:27,792 --> 00:56:29,958
我系噉用匙羹撩下撩下
I idly found diced turkey…

710
00:56:30,625 --> 00:56:33,000
我竟然撩到一粒美味嘅火鸡肉
in the soup.

711
00:56:34,167 --> 00:56:37,083
嗰晚唔使讲，当然系我渴望咗⋯
That night finally came the long awaited…

712
00:56:37,208 --> 00:56:40,708
好耐好耐好耐好耐嘅⋯圣诞火鸡大餐！
Christmas turkey dinner!

713
00:56:40,875 --> 00:56:44,875
一片一片嘅火鸡肉伴碟嘅有薯仔同节瓜⋯
Slices of meat, accompanied by gourd and potato…

714
00:56:45,083 --> 00:56:47,708
上面淋咗一层老抽生粉献
Were dressed with soy sauce.

715
00:56:48,833 --> 00:56:52,000
我哋真系好兴奋，好满足
It was an exciting, satisfactory moment for us.

716
00:56:52,333 --> 00:56:54,500
之后，我哋仲食咗一个礼拜嘅⋯
The following week,

717
00:56:54,625 --> 00:56:57,000
火鸡三文治做早餐
turkey sandwich for breakfast.

718
00:56:57,167 --> 00:56:58,083
星期日
Sunday,

719
00:56:58,208 --> 00:57:01,542
我大着胆同妈妈讲：不如饮茶
I boldly suggested eating out.

720
00:57:01,792 --> 00:57:03,583
妈妈闹我「冇衣食」⋯
Mother said I was ungrateful…

721
00:57:03,708 --> 00:57:05,708
但系都带咗我去饮茶
But took me out anyway.

722
00:57:06,333 --> 00:57:08,292
之后，妈妈又有计⋯
Then mother got inspired again.

723
00:57:08,625 --> 00:57:12,083
佢将雪柜净返嘅火鸡肉系噉撕系噉撕
What was left of the turkey was sliced…

724
00:57:12,208 --> 00:57:14,625
有时都叫我帮手撕
With me helping out at times.

725
00:57:15,208 --> 00:57:16,917
火鸡留喺指甲嗰阵味
It was not easy to get rid of…

726
00:57:17,542 --> 00:57:20,208
原来洗好多次都仲喺度㗎
the turkey's smell.

727
00:57:22,958 --> 00:57:25,667
银芽火鸡丝炒米，好味道噉
Fried noodle with sliced turkey, yummy.

728
00:57:26,167 --> 00:57:28,250
栗子焖火鸡丝煲
Steaming chestnut bowl with sliced turkey.

729
00:57:29,375 --> 00:57:31,583
花生火鸡骨煲粥
Peanut congee with turkey bone.

730
00:57:31,750 --> 00:57:33,583
纸包火鸡包包纸
Paper turkey bun.

731
00:57:34,250 --> 00:57:36,542
包火鸡包包包火鸡包
Paper turkey paper bun.

732
00:57:37,125 --> 00:57:39,667
酿火鸡馅搽面包
Turkey pete with bread.

733
00:57:40,625 --> 00:57:46,625
唉，我后悔讲过「火鸡疴烂煮」呢句嘢
I shouldn't have said anything about the turkey's stomach.

734
00:57:46,917 --> 00:57:51,208
到端午节，当我督开我最钟意食嘅裹蒸粽嘅时候⋯
Came Dragon Boat Festival, when I dug into the dumpling…

735
00:57:51,375 --> 00:57:55,792
发现宿喺咸蛋旁边嘅系一件火鸡背脊⋯
And found more pieces of turkey…

736
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:59,667
我脑部一时想唔通，喊咗起上嚟
I lost it. I cried.

737
00:58:00,292 --> 00:58:01,792
救命啊！
Oh please!

738
00:58:02,792 --> 00:58:05,875
妈妈静鸡鸡将净低嘅火鸡撇咗
When mother finally disposed of the turkey…

739
00:58:06,167 --> 00:58:10,417
原来嗰阵已经系只火鸡解冻咗差唔多半年后嘅事
It was already half a year later.

740
00:58:10,542 --> 00:58:14,542
我嘅美梦同噩梦都同时完结
My beautiful dream ended with my nightmare.

741
00:58:15,125 --> 00:58:16,625
后来我先知道⋯
Later, I learned that…

742
00:58:16,792 --> 00:58:18,625
一只火鸡由出世到畀人㓥
A serving turkey needs only be raised…

743
00:58:18,792 --> 00:58:21,083
都不过系几个月之间嘅事
For a few months.

744
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:25,417
即系话，只火鸡死咗之后同我哋一齐嘅日子
The time the turkey spent with us…

745
00:58:25,625 --> 00:58:28,208
仲长过佢自己本身条命
Was in fact longer than its life.

746
00:58:28,833 --> 00:58:31,417
我仲发觉到，火鸡嘅味道⋯
I realized also, with turkey…

747
00:58:31,583 --> 00:58:35,792
未食同食第一啖之间已经系佢嘅最高峰
Taking the first bite is all that matters.

748
00:58:36,333 --> 00:58:40,083
之后，不过都系食开就食埋落去噉解
Afterwards, it is just "be over and done with".

749
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:43,333
我冇哲学家嘅头脑⋯
I am no philosopher.

750
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:46,542
唔知呢两样嘢要得出啲咩道理
I could not come up with any profundity.

751
00:58:47,542 --> 00:58:49,208
但系呢啲谂法⋯
But, such thoughts…

752
00:58:49,375 --> 00:58:50,750
喺我长大之后⋯
After I grew up…

753
00:58:51,750 --> 00:58:54,042
系一啲同圣诞节无关嘅日子⋯
On days unrelated to Christmas…

754
00:58:54,875 --> 00:58:58,292
无端端噉喺我脑部出现过两三次
Did come up again a couple of times.

755
00:59:00,333 --> 00:59:03,708
一次，喺我自己嘅婚宴上
Once, it was at my wedding.

756
00:59:04,208 --> 00:59:05,500
一次⋯
Once…

757
00:59:05,667 --> 00:59:07,917
喺我妈妈火化嗰日
It was at my mother's cremation.

758
00:59:08,875 --> 00:59:12,833
嗰日，我望住天空几条灰色嘅烟
That day, I was looking at the smoke rising up.

759
00:59:13,625 --> 00:59:16,792
忽然闻到火鸡又浓又淡嘅气味
Suddenly, the smell of the turkey returned.

760
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:22,542
我后悔要妈妈撇咗几件火鸡
I regretted I made mother throw the turkey away.

761
01:00:21,833 --> 01:00:23,208
特别报道
"Special Report"

762
01:00:23,417 --> 01:00:28,000
奥运滑浪风帆金牌得主李丽珊决定参加今届嘅奥运
Olympic medal winner San San Li will compete again…

763
01:00:28,125 --> 01:00:29,792
向全世界人再次证明⋯
To prove to the world that…

764
01:00:29,917 --> 01:00:32,542
香港嘅运动员唔系腊鸭
HK athletes are horrible.

765
01:00:33,167 --> 01:00:34,083
另一方面⋯
Also…

766
01:00:34,208 --> 01:00:37,625
中国香港体育协会暨奥委会会长霍震霆⋯
The local federation…

767
01:00:37,750 --> 01:00:40,000
正式向亚运协会提出申请
officially announced today:

768
01:00:40,125 --> 01:00:43,542
香港将要争夺下届亚运会嘅主办权
HK will apply to host the Asian Games.

769
01:00:44,250 --> 01:00:47,458
多个运动团体立即表示热烈支持
The response from all sides has been enthusiastic.

770
01:00:48,292 --> 01:00:50,792
其中港九新界竹战联谊会⋯
Among them, the Bamboo Game Association…

771
01:00:50,958 --> 01:00:53,875
更希望打麻雀可以成为亚运项目
is proposing Mahjong for official game.

772
01:00:54,375 --> 01:00:57,000
另外，全港茶餐厅员工协会⋯
While Tearoom Serving Groups…

773
01:00:57,125 --> 01:00:58,458
经已发动所有会员⋯
have vowed…

774
01:00:58,625 --> 01:01:02,458
争取「掟蛋挞」成为亚运会比赛项目
To campaign for "Tart Throwing".

775
01:01:02,917 --> 01:01:05,125
港九烧味卤味腊味同业会
As for the Cold Cut and Roasting Association…

776
01:01:05,250 --> 01:01:07,500
亦都向霍主席当面提出⋯
They believe…

777
01:01:07,667 --> 01:01:11,000
「挂腊鸭」可以成为亚运比赛项目
"Duck Hanging" would make an ideal addition.

778
01:01:12,042 --> 01:01:15,958
较为特别嘅系，CIC保险营业员联同⋯
More interesting, CIC Insurance is joining forces with…

779
01:01:16,083 --> 01:01:17,958
大角咀春田花花幼稚园⋯
Children from…

780
01:01:18,125 --> 01:01:20,167
附属小学嘅一班小朋友⋯
Spring Flower Primary School…

781
01:01:20,333 --> 01:01:22,333
争取「抢包山」
In support of…

782
01:01:22,708 --> 01:01:24,375
一项几乎绝迹嘅运动⋯
"Bun Snatching"…

783
01:01:24,542 --> 01:01:28,542
成为本港举办亚运重点推介嘅比赛项目
A game thought extinct.

784
01:02:30,917 --> 01:02:32,042
最后⋯
In the end…

785
01:02:32,500 --> 01:02:34,875
最后，全部都系「芭﹣娜﹣娜」
Nothing came of anything.

786
01:02:35,375 --> 01:02:38,875
最后，佢哋选咗「掟蛋挞」做推介项目
"Tart Throwing" was chosen as the highlight.

787
01:02:39,125 --> 01:02:41,458
至于香港争取申办亚运嘅口号⋯
As for the official slogan…

788
01:02:41,625 --> 01:02:45,542
亦都顺理成章噉叫做「香港一蛋挞」
"HK, One Big Tart" was a logical choice.

789
01:02:47,292 --> 01:02:49,625
之后李丽珊蝉联失败⋯
Then San San Li lost.

790
01:02:51,917 --> 01:02:53,000
亚运主办权⋯
And the hosting right of the Asian Games…

791
01:02:53,125 --> 01:02:56,375
亦都由一个香港人从未听过嘅地方夺得
Went to a place Hong Kong people have never heard of.

792
01:02:58,500 --> 01:03:01,625
谂住可以转行做运动员嘅茶餐厅伙计⋯
Tearoom workers, those aspiring athletes…

793
01:03:01,750 --> 01:03:05,292
都返返去茶餐厅继续掟佢哋嘅蛋挞
Went back to where they used to throw their tarts.

794
01:03:05,417 --> 01:03:07,083
一切回复正常
Everything went on as usual.

795
01:03:12,375 --> 01:03:15,792
上个中学，我已经再冇练习抢包手
In secondary school, I stopped practicing the 12 hands.

796
01:03:16,917 --> 01:03:18,500
间中同妈妈饮茶⋯
Sometimes, when I went out with mother…

797
01:03:18,667 --> 01:03:21,542
我都会手快快噉帮佢抢个笼大包
I'd still snatch a bun for her.

798
01:03:22,875 --> 01:03:25,250
之后，茶楼都冇卖大包
Then they stopped selling buns.

799
01:03:26,167 --> 01:03:28,708
推车仔都转咗用点心纸
Carts were replaced by ordering sheets.

800
01:03:29,417 --> 01:03:31,542
一切都落空
Everything came to nothing.

801
01:03:42,333 --> 01:03:45,458
有时我都会同班同学仔返长洲烧嘢食
At times, I'd go to Cheung Chau for barbecue.

802
01:03:45,958 --> 01:03:47,542
每次见到师傅⋯
The master looked older…

803
01:03:47,792 --> 01:03:49,708
佢都好似老咗啲噉
Each time I saw him.

804
01:03:54,250 --> 01:03:55,542
因为环保⋯
For environmental reasons…

805
01:03:55,708 --> 01:03:58,958
长洲嘅抢包经已转咗用塑胶
They'd changed to snatching plastic buns.

806
01:04:00,125 --> 01:04:03,417
师傅话，嗰阵胶气，都几臭下
Master thought they stunk.

807
01:04:09,250 --> 01:04:11,417
长洲有个张保仔洞
On Cheung Chau was a Cheung Po Tsai Cave.

808
01:04:11,792 --> 01:04:15,792
听讲海盗张保仔喺里面收埋咗好多宝藏
Where legend claimed a pirate hid his treasure.

809
01:04:16,958 --> 01:04:20,500
因为我练过抢包手，身手比较灵活⋯
As I was the one who could crawl…

810
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:25,250
班同学叫我爬去睇下，话唔定会发达
My mates said I should take a look and maybe get rich.

811
01:04:25,417 --> 01:04:29,042
于是我就向住呢一个又黑又窄嘅洞⋯
So I crawled along the dark and narrow cave.

812
01:04:29,333 --> 01:04:32,417
系噉爬爬
Crawling.

813
01:04:32,917 --> 01:04:36,708
洞里面乜都冇，净系有一个盒
There was nothing but a box.

814
01:04:37,250 --> 01:04:39,000
我好小心揭开呢个盒⋯
I opened the box…

815
01:04:39,167 --> 01:04:42,417
发现入面系一个食剩咗嘅大包
Inside, there was an unfinished bun.

816
01:04:43,167 --> 01:04:45,667
唔知系咪张保仔食净㗎啦？
Maybe the pirate didn't get to finish it.

817
01:04:46,958 --> 01:04:55,542
「寻晚，食了六个餐包」
"Eating 6 buns last night…"

818
01:04:55,667 --> 01:05:04,500
「可惜我依然系觉得仍未十分饱」
"Still left me hungry."

819
01:05:05,333 --> 01:05:13,250
「寻晚，食了磅半方包」
"Eating 1½ lb white bread last night…"

820
01:05:13,417 --> 01:05:24,792
「可叹是我依然觉得，不够顶肚」
"Still left me hungry."

821
01:05:26,750 --> 01:05:35,042
「年少，练了六套脚法。」
"Excelled 6 sets of steps when I was young…"

822
01:05:35,208 --> 01:05:42,458
「可惜我依然未觉够用。」
"Still left me empty."

823
01:05:44,042 --> 01:05:57,375
「年晚，又培育了珊珊！可惜⋯」
"Brought up San San when I am old! Still…"

824
01:05:57,917 --> 01:06:01,292
揸住个包，我忽然明白⋯
Bun in hand, I suddenly realized…

825
01:06:02,333 --> 01:06:06,292
原来有啲嘢，冇就真系冇
There are things that cannot be forced.

826
01:06:07,125 --> 01:06:09,292
唔得，就真系唔得
A no is a no.

827
01:06:10,458 --> 01:06:14,083
冇鱼蛋冇粗面冇去马尔代夫⋯
No fishball, no noodle, no Maldives…

828
01:06:14,250 --> 01:06:16,500
冇奖牌冇张保仔宝藏
No medal, no pirate's treasure.

829
01:06:17,250 --> 01:06:20,542
而张保仔，亦都冇咬过个包
And the pirate took no bite.

830
01:06:21,167 --> 01:06:24,292
原来蠢，唔系咁好笑
Stupid is not funny.

831
01:06:25,583 --> 01:06:27,000
蠢会失败⋯
Stupid leads to failure…

832
01:06:27,708 --> 01:06:29,083
会失望
To disappointment.

833
01:06:30,625 --> 01:06:33,333
失望，唔系咁好笑
Disappointed is not funny.

834
01:06:34,208 --> 01:06:36,208
肥，都未必好笑
Fatness is not funny too.

835
01:06:37,500 --> 01:06:39,667
肥，唔一定大力
Fatness is not powerful.

836
01:06:39,875 --> 01:06:41,917
大力，亦都唔一定得
Power doesn't mean yes.

837
01:06:44,667 --> 01:06:47,208
揸住个包，我忽然喺度谂⋯
Bun in hand, I suddenly thought…

838
01:06:47,583 --> 01:06:50,042
大个咗，到我要面对呢一个实掘掘⋯
Growing up, facing this sordid world…

839
01:06:50,750 --> 01:06:53,417
未必到你发梦，又未必咁好笑嘅⋯
This not so dreamy, not so funny world…

840
01:06:53,583 --> 01:06:57,625
世界嘅时候，我会系点㗎呢？
What shall I be?

841
01:07:05,375 --> 01:07:16,417
「⋯无力挽！」
"… Nothing shall be done!"

842
01:07:35,292 --> 01:07:37,125
"Fat, Still"

843
01:07:42,250 --> 01:07:44,542
橙
"Powerful"

844
01:08:19,458 --> 01:08:22,333
系呀，我就系大个佬麦兜喇
Right, I am McDull the big guy.

845
01:08:23,542 --> 01:08:26,500
肥啰，算大力啦
Fat, with raw power.

846
01:08:27,083 --> 01:08:28,958
麻麻地得咁啦
Not doing too well.

847
01:08:29,750 --> 01:08:31,333
负家产啰
Negative property.

848
01:08:34,042 --> 01:08:38,292
脚瓜真系几大，仲大过个节瓜
With a pair of really thick calves.

849
01:08:39,250 --> 01:08:41,917
脚瓜上面个肌肉非常结实⋯
Very muscular…

850
01:08:42,375 --> 01:08:47,083
啲青筋一条一条凸下凸下，好似钢筋
With steely veins running down.

851
01:08:47,917 --> 01:08:50,000
至于脚趾公啲脚甲⋯
As for the toenails…

852
01:08:50,333 --> 01:08:53,417
有次我无无聊聊真系走去卡下佢⋯
I got bored one time and stared at it…

853
01:08:53,833 --> 01:08:56,750
哗，足足成寸咁厚
They're tough, no kidding!

854
01:08:58,458 --> 01:09:00,958
系呀，故事讲完喇
Yes, the story ends here.

855
01:09:01,708 --> 01:09:03,500
呢个系一个尝试
This is a try.

856
01:09:04,375 --> 01:09:07,417
失败⋯尝试⋯
Error… Try…

857
01:09:07,917 --> 01:09:11,458
好多包⋯但系冇包保成功嘅故事
No guarantee that one would make it.

858
01:09:12,875 --> 01:09:14,500
故事讲咗一轮⋯
In the end…

859
01:09:14,917 --> 01:09:18,042
乜都冇？又唔系噃
Zero gain? Not really.

860
01:09:18,625 --> 01:09:21,667
就系大咗两个脚瓜
I have my calves.

861
01:09:23,083 --> 01:09:25,792
但系冻住两个脚瓜企喺度⋯
But, standing here like this…

862
01:09:26,250 --> 01:09:28,250
当啲浪打埋嚟⋯
When the waves hit…

863
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:32,250
嗰种感觉真系好好
I feel great.

864
01:09:34,167 --> 01:09:37,083
你知我麻麻地叻佬，唔识得⋯
You see, smart guys like me don't really know…

865
01:09:37,250 --> 01:09:41,500
帮自己嘅故事加啲教训呀锦囊呀嗰啲嘢
How to make a lesson out of his own story.

866
01:09:42,042 --> 01:09:44,833
但系，冻住两个脚瓜企喺水嗰度⋯
With calves in water…

867
01:09:45,292 --> 01:09:50,417
当风吹喺我个脑部，我会谂⋯
When the wind blows, I'd think…

868
01:09:50,750 --> 01:09:53,167
如果妈妈见到我呢个大脚瓜⋯
If mother could see me like this…

869

都系唔好呀，都系出返个锦囊先得！
"I've come up with a lesson!"

871
01:10:16,417 --> 01:10:20,708
妈妈嘅dot com散咗之后，佢又有计喇
Mother got inspired after her dot com failed.

872
01:10:21,208 --> 01:10:24,958
佢出咗本教煮餸嘅食谱，咁煮喇饭咋晒
She published a cookbook.

873
01:10:25,250 --> 01:10:28,042
食谱最后一页系教人整烧鸡嘅

879
01:10:44,417 --> 01:10:46,375
食谱度又补充噉话：
There was a remark in the cookbook:

880
01:10:47,083 --> 01:10:49,417
如果想你个鸡烧得美味可口⋯
If you want a delicious chicken…

881
01:10:50,125 --> 01:10:52,750
冇话食完腰心腰肺顶住个胃
A chicken that wouldn't upset you…

882
01:10:53,250 --> 01:10:58,250
个秘诀系：唔该，烧得佢好啲啰⋯
The secret is: please, roast it well!
