1
00:00:48,792 --> 00:00:51,125
在麦太即将临盆的时候
When Mrs. McBing was in labour…

2
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:54,000
一只胶兜在九龙上空飞过
A pan appeared in the sky.

3
00:00:55,042 --> 00:00:58,208
沿荔枝角道直出大角咀道
It flied along Garden Street…

4
00:00:58,375 --> 00:01:04,750
经好彩酒家左转花园街乐园牛丸王⋯
Turned left, and stopped at the Beefball King.

5
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:06,958
更正一下：
Correction:

6
00:01:07,083 --> 00:01:10,042
先到街市大楼妹记鱼腩粥外边
It first arrived at the Market Building…

7
00:01:10,333 --> 00:01:13,292
转呀，转⋯再更正一下：
Lingered a bit… Correction:

8
00:01:13,375 --> 00:01:18,458
直出亚皆老街跨过火车桥右转太平道
It flied over the railway, turned right…

9
00:01:18,583 --> 00:01:23,792
再右拐窝打老道向女人街方向飞⋯
And headed directly for the Bazaar.

10
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:25,708
飞呀，飞⋯
It flied on…

11
00:01:25,875 --> 00:01:29,042
胶兜最后飞进广华医院候产房
At last coming into the maternity ward.

12
00:01:29,208 --> 00:01:32,500
也就是在麦太右边额角上⋯
There, on the right hand side of Mrs. McBing.

13
00:01:32,792 --> 00:01:35,083
更正：左边额角上⋯
Correction: Left hand side.

14
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:37,708
转呀，转⋯
The pan stayed.

15
00:01:38,167 --> 00:01:40,167
麦太认定这是异像
Mrs. McBing, convinced that this was a miracle,

16
00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:43,292
于是向额角上的胶兜许愿
Made a wish…

17
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:47,167
脑海中同时出现即将诞生的儿子容貌⋯
Thinking of her soon-to-be-born son.

18
00:01:47,333 --> 00:01:50,458
希望他好聪明，读书好叻！
Please make him a clever and smart boy!

19
00:01:50,708 --> 00:01:53,833
胶兜对麦太的愿望似乎没有反应
The pan didn't seem to hear her words.

20
00:01:53,958 --> 00:01:56,167
于是她向胶兜补充说：
So Mrs. McBing amended her wish:

21
00:01:56,333 --> 00:01:58,875
或者读书唔叻，工作叻呢？
Or make him a smart businessman?

22
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,542
又或者⋯
Or maybe…

23
00:02:00,667 --> 00:02:02,542
又或者好靓仔，好靓仔
Or make him really handsome.

24
00:02:02,708 --> 00:02:06,042
跟周润发，梁朝伟那么靓仔！
As handsome as Chow Yun Fat or Tony Leung!

25
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:12,042
胶兜仍然在转，毫无点头迹象
The pan didn't respond.

26
00:02:12,167 --> 00:02:13,583
麦太一时心虚
Mrs. McBing, in panic…

27
00:02:13,792 --> 00:02:17,667
赶忙趁胶兜落地前另许一个愿望：
Made a final amendment:

28
00:02:18,042 --> 00:02:21,708
唔聪明唔靓仔也算了，只要福星高照
Her boy needed not to be smart or handsome

29
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:24,917
一世够运，逢凶化吉！
As long as luck be with him!

30
00:02:25,958 --> 00:02:29,542
靠自己能力解决事情当然最好
It's nice to depend on oneself…

31
00:02:29,667 --> 00:02:31,917
不过运气还是很重要的
But luck is essential still.

32
00:02:32,167 --> 00:02:35,500
虽是说像梁朝伟周润发也行运定了
Of course Chow and Leung are lucky guys…

33
00:02:36,292 --> 00:02:38,875
但总得要叻仔呀！
But then they are smart too!

34
00:02:42,208 --> 00:02:44,542
最后，胶兜「𠼬督」一声落地
Finally, the pan dropped to the floor…

35
00:02:44,708 --> 00:02:49,458
𠼬督？𠼬督，就是答应了
Mrs. McBing, believing her wish granted…

36
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:52,417
麦太想，这次走运了！
Thought that was magnificent!

37
00:02:52,583 --> 00:02:54,167
可是答应了些什么呢？
But what had the pan granted her?

38
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:57,375
叻仔？好运？
A smart boy? A lucky boy?

39
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,417
还是似周润发？
Or a Chow look-alike?

40
00:03:00,667 --> 00:03:02,708
为了纪念这赐福的胶兜
To commemorate this, Mrs. McBing…

41
00:03:03,208 --> 00:03:06,250
麦太决定把儿子命名麦胶
Decided to name her son McNificent.

42
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:09,750
不行，胶胶声，多难听！
No! It's better to be humble!

43
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:11,958
还是唤他麦兜！
I'll name him McDull!

44
00:03:12,167 --> 00:03:13,292
各位⋯
Dear all…

45
00:03:13,458 --> 00:03:16,208
我就是险些给定名麦胶的小朋友⋯
I am the boy, no more McNificent…

46
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:18,542
麦兜！
I'm McDull!

47
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:45,083
麦太，没见面一阵
Oh dear,

48
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:47,083
怎么小腿粗起来了？
your calves have grown strong.

49
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:48,875
可怜呀，每天扑来扑去⋯
"I've been desperately…

50
00:04:49,042 --> 00:04:50,500
替儿子找幼稚园！
looking for a school!

51
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:52,667
怎么不试一试好彩酒楼对面
Why not try the one…

52
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:54,667
旧中侨国货楼上的⋯
at the Emporium?

53
00:04:54,792 --> 00:04:57,083
春田花花幼稚园？
The Spring Flower Kindergarten?

54
00:04:57,292 --> 00:04:59,833
就是座落界限街南昌街交界⋯
Yeah! The one at the junction…

55
00:05:00,042 --> 00:05:01,667
银城美食广场附近的⋯
Right next to Silver City Food Mall.

56
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:03,833
春田花花幼稚园？
The Spring Flower Kindergarten!

57
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,208
对！深水埗地铁站步行不用10分钟！
Only 10 minutes walk from the MTR Station!

58
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:11,625
春田花花幼稚园，师资优良⋯
Spring Flower Kindergarten, good environment…

59
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:14,208
而且还有西人教英文！
With white teachers for English class!

60
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:16,125
西人教英文？
White teachers for English class?

61
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:16,958
是呀！
Yeah!

62
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:22,417
春田花花，确有好多西人呀！
Spring Flower offers white teachers!

63
00:05:31,292 --> 00:05:35,958
"鹅满是快烙滴好耳痛⋯"
"We are all happy children…"

64
00:05:36,042 --> 00:05:40,917
"鹅闷天天一戏个窗！"
"We sing everyday!"

65
00:05:41,042 --> 00:05:45,625
“鹅们在壳习，鹅闷载升胀⋯”
"We learn as we grow…"

66
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:50,792
"鹅闷是春天滴化！"
"We are the flowers of spring!"

67
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:54,083
这个猪样白兔小朋友⋯
This piggy kid in a rabbit outfit…

68
00:05:54,292 --> 00:05:58,625
横看竖看也不像发哥伟仔的一个⋯
Who doesn't look the least like Chow or Leung…

69
00:05:58,792 --> 00:06:01,167
就是我，麦兜
That's me, McDull.

70
00:06:02,292 --> 00:06:04,000
这是我就读的幼稚园
This is my kindergarten.

71
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:06,542
校长是潮州人
The headmaster came from the countryside…

72
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,875
可能是潮州口音的关系
As a result, he speaks with an accent.

73
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:10,208
这么多年来⋯
For many years…

74
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:12,875
我其实不大明白他的说话
I had difficulty hearing him.

75
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:17,833
﹣蛋挞！　　﹣蛋挞！
- Tart!    - Tart!

76
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,583
﹣荔芋火鸭礼！　　﹣荔芋火鸭礼！
- Duck dumpling!    - Duck dumpling!

77
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:29,792
﹣忘记校训九十七⋯　　﹣忘记校训九十七⋯
- The 97 Rule…    - The 97 Rule…

78
00:06:29,958 --> 00:06:33,083
也不能忘记校训九十八！
Shall be replaced by the 98 Rule!

79
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:38,792
也不能忘记校训九十八！
Shall be replaced by the 98 Rule!

80
00:06:39,167 --> 00:06:40,667
好！各位同学⋯
Good, children!

81
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:43,208
今天的早会主要是跟大家分享
We are sharing an important issue…

82
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:45,000
一个重要主题：
this morning:

83
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:48,417
小朋友，这个月你们交过学费没有？
Children, have you handed in the school fee?

84
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:50,792
交过了！
Yes!

85
00:06:50,958 --> 00:06:54,375
太好了！大家去上堂吧
Great! Now move to class.

86
00:06:57,875 --> 00:07:00,417
你们可能觉得这间幼稚园很烂
You might conclude that this is a shabby school.

87
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:03,125
可是，对我和我一班同学
But, for me and my mates…

88
00:07:03,708 --> 00:07:06,625
这儿是我们最快乐，最美丽的乐园⋯
This is the most beautiful paradise!

89
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,000
⋯还有一个很疼我们
…Also, there is Miss Chan.

90
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:12,833
就是有点游魂的Miss Chan
Who adores us in her absent-minded way.

91
00:07:13,917 --> 00:07:16,083
她的志愿是做第二个王菲
Also, she is a Faye Wong wannabe.

92
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:18,708
做第二个陈慧琳也可以
Actually, Kelly Chan will do!

93
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:20,750
我们现在开始点名

104
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:45,208
呀，真的吗？
Oops!

105
00:07:45,917 --> 00:07:48,417

115
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:11,375
还有谁没点过吗？
Have I missed anyone?

116
00:08:11,542 --> 00:08:13,458
麦兜！
McDull!

117
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:15,667
麦兜同学！
McDull!

118
00:08:16,667 --> 00:08:18,208
麦兜同学！
McDull!

119
00:08:18,708 --> 00:08:20,000
麦兜同学！
McDull!

120
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:22,167
麦唛呀，即是呢⋯
Hey, I don't understand…

121
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:23,625
我好像觉得呢⋯
I keep feeling that…

122
00:08:23,792 --> 00:08:27,625
有什么人在喊我似的
Someone is calling me.

123
00:08:28,583 --> 00:08:30,500
你们不要以为我心散
Don't think that I've been daydreaming.

124
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:33,667
其实我正在思考一个学术问题：
I was contemplating something academic:

125
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:36,917
橙，为什么会是「疴-烂-煮」呢？
How does this universe work?

126
00:08:37,542 --> 00:08:39,833
妈妈说吃橙可通大便
I mean, I ate 6 oranges that morning…

127
00:08:40,042 --> 00:08:44,542
「疴」这个我明白，可是「烂-煮」呢？
And my stomach wouldn't stop.

128
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:47,125
还有这个「芭-娜-娜」香蕉
Then I ate 3 bananas this morning.

129
00:08:47,292 --> 00:08:50,375
为什么雨伞又会是「暗-芭-娜-娜」呢？
Again my stomach wouldn't stop…

130
00:08:50,542 --> 00:08:52,958
我「暗」的「暗」掉一条蕉
It just wouldn't stop!

131
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:57,083
至多是疴烂煮，怎么会下起雨来呢？
How are these two things related?

132
00:08:57,958 --> 00:09:00,500
这世界还有很多事情我弄不明白
There are so many things that I don't understand.

133
00:09:00,667 --> 00:09:02,292
但我不害怕
But I am not afraid.

134
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,667
我想，有天我念完幼稚园
One day, when I finish kindergarten…

135
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:08,000
升小学，上中学
I shall move up…

136
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:09,750
再念大学⋯
And get my degree.

137
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:11,167
当我大学毕业的时候
When I graduate from university, I know…

138
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,292
我知道我会明白一切！
I shall understand everything!

139
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:14,583
那时候⋯
And then …

140
00:09:15,125 --> 00:09:17,292
我买所房子给妈妈！
I will buy my mother a house!

141
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:24,125
幼稚园楼下，由校长兼营的茶餐厅
Our headmaster runs a tea stand…

142
00:09:24,292 --> 00:09:27,375
我们一班同学下课后经常光顾
Which we kids frequent after class.

143
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:30,125
﹣鱼蛋粗面，麻烦你　　﹣粗面买光了
- Fishball noodle, please.    - No noodle left.

144
00:09:30,417 --> 00:09:33,917
﹣那样子⋯来碗鱼蛋河粉吧　　﹣鱼蛋买光了
- Fishball rice noodle then.    - No fishball left.

145
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:37,792
﹣那么⋯金钱肚粗面好了　　﹣粗面买光了
- Chicken wing noodle then.    - No noodle left.

146
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:41,833
﹣那么要鱼蛋油面吧　　﹣鱼蛋买光了
- How about fishball congee?    - No fishball left.

147
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,417
怎么都买光了？
Nothing left today?

148
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:46,625
﹣来个墨鱼丸粗面吧　　﹣粗面买光了
- How about beef noodle?    - No noodle left.

149
00:09:46,917 --> 00:09:47,958
又买光了？

299
00:23:58,833 --> 00:24:00,625
妈妈什么时候骗过你？
Has mother ever lied before?

300
00:24:01,125 --> 00:24:03,542
乖，先把药水喝掉
Now, drink up.

301
00:24:09,458 --> 00:24:11,875
好呀，马尔代夫！
Yes, Maldives!

302
00:24:12,292 --> 00:24:13,250
马尔代夫！
Maldives!

303
00:24:13,458 --> 00:24:14,417
马尔代夫！
Maldives!

304
00:24:14,542 --> 00:24:15,792
马尔代夫！
Maldives!

305
00:24:16,333 --> 00:24:19,083
妈妈，那么我们什么时候去？
Mother, when will we go?

306
00:24:19,792 --> 00:24:25,042
你先把药水喝掉，病好了我就去订机票
I will book the ticket once you get well.

307
00:24:26,125 --> 00:24:28,000
来，多喝一点！
Come on, drink up!

308
00:24:45,917 --> 00:24:47,917
妈妈，你看！
Look, mother!

309
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:53,708
妈妈你看，我病好了！
Mother, I am well!

310
00:24:53,958 --> 00:24:56,000
我把药都吃光了
I've taken all the medicine.

311
00:24:56,167 --> 00:24:58,667
家中的东西有什么没给你吃光的？
But you've taken everything edible at home.

312
00:24:58,833 --> 00:25:02,417
这次不同呀，原来这么一大樽的
You see, the whole bottle was filled…

313
00:25:02,583 --> 00:25:05,750
我喝一格，又喝一格，又喝一格⋯
And I gulped it down bit by bit…

314
00:25:06,042 --> 00:25:08,333
就给我喝光了！
I did it!

315
00:25:14,083 --> 00:25:15,667
喝光了就叻仔了！
Now I am a good boy!

316
00:25:15,833 --> 00:25:18,167
喝光了就病好了！
Now I am not sick!

317
00:25:18,292 --> 00:25:19,167
妈妈呀⋯
Mother…

318
00:25:19,333 --> 00:25:20,375
什么事？
What?

319
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,917
我们什么时候去马尔代夫？
When are we going to Maldives?

320
00:25:23,083 --> 00:25:24,750
什么马尔代夫？
Maldives?

321
00:25:24,958 --> 00:25:28,417
你说我病好带我去马尔代夫的呀！
You said we would go once I got well.

322
00:25:28,583 --> 00:25:31,958
马尔代夫，椰林树影，水清沙幼⋯
Maldives, where the trees tall and water bright…

323
00:25:32,083 --> 00:25:35,167
座落于印度洋的世外桃源呀！
The world outside our world!

324
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:38,667
想不到你还有点文采
Those words have flair.

325
00:25:38,833 --> 00:25:40,125
说得不错呀！
I am happy for you.

326
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:45,250
我不是光说的呀，妈妈你说过⋯
Mother, you promised…

327
00:25:45,458 --> 00:25:50,417
我病好了带我去马尔代夫的！
We'd go to Maldives once I got well.

328
00:25:50,583 --> 00:25:53,500
我是说发了财就带你去
I meant once I get rich.

329
00:25:54,417 --> 00:25:58,708
不是的，妈妈你说我病好了就去的
No, that wasn't what you meant.

330
00:26:01,625 --> 00:26:06,083
你分明讲过病好了就去马尔代夫的
You said we'd go once I got well.

331
00:26:07,042 --> 00:26:09,125
你讲过的！
You promised!

332
00:26:09,958 --> 00:26:12,000
好了，别哭了
Now stop crying.

333
00:26:12,167 --> 00:26:13,708
带你去马尔代夫好了
We will go to Maldives.

334
00:26:13,875 --> 00:26:15,542
﹣真的吗？　　﹣对
- Really?    - Yes.

335
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:17,000
什么时候去？
When?

336
00:26:17,167 --> 00:26:18,542
发财再说
Once I get rich.

337
00:26:18,708 --> 00:26:20,167
你早发财了⋯
But you are rich.

338
00:26:20,333 --> 00:26:22,042
好了好了，发财了
Sure, sure, I am rich.

339
00:26:22,208 --> 00:26:23,500
我们下个星期去，好了吧？
We will go next week, ok?

340
00:26:23,625 --> 00:26:24,542
太好了！
Bravo!

341
00:27:00,333 --> 00:27:03,917
麦唛，我是麦兜呀
This is McDull.

342
00:27:04,042 --> 00:27:06,167
是这样子的，我明天就飞了
Hey, I'm leaving tomorrow.

343
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:08,667
﹣对　　﹣⋯是吗？
- Yes…    - Is that right?

344
00:27:08,833 --> 00:27:10,292
飞机餐很难吃的吗？
The food on board is horrible?

345
00:27:10,417 --> 00:27:12,167
也得吃呀！
Be it so!

346
00:27:12,333 --> 00:27:14,417
难道自己带东西上去吃吗？
We couldn't bring our own food, right?

347
00:27:14,542 --> 00:27:15,542
还在讲？
Still chatting away?

348
00:27:15,708 --> 00:27:18,208
快点帮手执行李
You need to pack.

349
00:27:18,375 --> 00:27:22,625
跟我向他们说，我明天去马尔代夫了
Tell them I'm going to Maldives tomorrow.

350
00:27:22,833 --> 00:27:26,708
那边蓝天白云，椰林树影⋯
Where the trees tall and water bright…

351
00:27:26,833 --> 00:27:27,917
还在讲！
Hey, you!

352
00:27:28,042 --> 00:27:29,500
来了！
Coming!

353
00:27:30,125 --> 00:27:33,417
要执行李了，回来再跟你说吧
I need to pack now. Talk to you later.

354
00:27:33,583 --> 00:27:35,125
再见！
See you!

355
00:27:44,667 --> 00:27:48,458
妈妈，我得把出世纸带着吗？
Mother, do I need to bring my birth certificate?

356
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:49,458
也要的
I guess so.

357
00:27:49,583 --> 00:27:50,542
那么成绩表呢？
And school report?

358
00:27:50,667 --> 00:27:51,917
成绩表就不用了
We don't need that.

359
00:27:52,083 --> 00:27:55,292
太好了！吓得我！
Wow, I'm saved!

360
00:28:05,292 --> 00:28:06,875
找到了！
I found it!

361
00:28:07,042 --> 00:28:09,583
出世纸给我找到了！
I found my birth certificate!

362
00:28:12,375 --> 00:28:20,917
妈妈你替我收好它别抛掉
Mother, you keep it and don't lose it…

363
00:28:21,083 --> 00:28:23,500
抛掉就去不成了
Or else we're stuck.

364
00:32:22,167 --> 00:32:24,875
早机去，晚机返
Leave on the morning, return at night.

365
00:32:25,083 --> 00:32:27,292
妈妈说这样才够精明
Mother said that'd make things worthy.

366
00:32:27,417 --> 00:32:28,583
就这样⋯
Hence…

367
00:32:28,917 --> 00:32:30,875
我过了我小时候最精明⋯
The most beautiful day in my childhood experience…

368
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,875
最美丽的一天
Passed.

369
00:32:33,417 --> 00:32:35,958
依你说，纸是否可以包着鸡呢？
Do you think paper is a good chicken wrapper?

370
00:32:36,542 --> 00:32:37,875
也可以的⋯
Maybe.

371
00:32:38,583 --> 00:32:41,000
特别是小小一块的
If only for one small piece.

372
00:33:06,042 --> 00:33:08,250
妈妈晚安！
- Goodnight, mother!    - Goodnight!

373
00:33:46,542 --> 00:33:48,000
最新消息
The Hong Kong…

374
00:33:48,125 --> 00:33:52,292
奥运滑浪风帆选手李丽珊五场四胜
windsurfing athlete San San Li…

375
00:33:52,458 --> 00:33:55,667
夺得香港历史上第一面奥运金牌！
Has just won the first gold medal in Hong Kong history!

376
00:33:55,833 --> 00:33:59,708
消息说当李丽珊获悉自己稳夺金牌后
San San, when confirmed her winning…

377
00:33:59,833 --> 00:34:03,875
激动地对在场记者表示她今次的成绩⋯
Told reporters that her result…

378
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,667
足以证明香港运动员不是腊鸭！
Helps prove that Hong Kong athletes are horrible…

379
00:34:09,292 --> 00:34:13,708
﹣对不起，应该　　﹣是垃圾，不是腊鸭！
Excuse me, it should be "honourable".

380
00:34:13,875 --> 00:34:18,875
﹣对不起，应该　　﹣不是垃圾，也不是腊鸭！
Hong Kong athletes are honourable athletes.

381
00:34:19,042 --> 00:34:21,000
特别报告完毕
End of special report.

382
00:34:25,042 --> 00:34:27,208
妈妈好像又有计了
Then, mother seemed inspired.

383
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,500
靓仔，好运，叻仔⋯
Handsome, lucky, smart…

384
00:34:30,625 --> 00:34:32,458
好像都没希望了
So much for those plans.

385
00:34:32,958 --> 00:34:35,458
是不是可以靠手瓜呢？
Now how about something physical?

386
00:34:36,958 --> 00:34:38,333
于是，一个梦还没醒⋯
And so, while one dream lingers on…

387
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:40,667
我又得到另一个梦
Another one begins.

388
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:45,417
应该是脚瓜
It's about the Calf!

389
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:47,583
我知道一点也不容易
I know it is not easy.

390
00:34:48,875 --> 00:34:51,583
我知道要找到黎根绝对不容易
I know it is not easy to find Logan.

391
00:34:52,875 --> 00:34:56,417
我知道要他收我做徒弟更加不容易
I know it is not easy for him to take me in.

392
00:34:59,708 --> 00:35:03,250
但无论多不容易，我都要试一试
No matter how difficult this is…

393
00:35:03,417 --> 00:35:05,500
我要黎根收我做徒弟！
Logan will be my master!

394
00:35:05,833 --> 00:35:09,875
无论几辛苦，我一定要得到奥运金牌！
I shall get an Olympic medal!

395
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:26,250
长洲！长洲！
Cheung Chau!

396
00:35:26,792 --> 00:35:31,250
你孕育了珊珊！你也会孕育我！
You raised San San, now you will raise me!

397
00:35:31,542 --> 00:35:34,542
当我站在奥运会颁奖台上
When I receive my Olympic medal…

398
00:35:34,792 --> 00:35:38,375
我会举起金牌跟全世界说：
I shall tell the world:

399
00:35:38,542 --> 00:35:42,083
香港运动员不是垃圾！
HK athletes are honourable athletes!

400
00:35:49,792 --> 00:35:53,417
长洲，我终于来到长洲了！
Cheung Chau, I finally make it here.

401
00:35:58,333 --> 00:36:05,583
长洲，我得亲吻这片圣洁的土地！
I must kiss this holy land!

402
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:13,667
小朋友，这儿是南丫岛呀！
Kiddo, this is Lamma Island.

403
00:36:14,667 --> 00:36:19,542
南Y岛？它也孕育了周润发！
Lamma Island? Where Chow Yun Fat grew up?

404
00:36:29,708 --> 00:36:34,500
想不到我黎根避进南丫岛也给你发现
I came into hiding on this island…

405
00:36:35,292 --> 00:36:39,500
小朋友，你知道什么是狗仔队吧？
To stay away from the paparazzi.

406
00:36:39,667 --> 00:36:45,083
加上总有小朋友及家长来说要拜我为师
And so many kids came to seek me out.

407
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:47,833
我才过来南Y岛避一避
So I came to live here.

408
00:36:48,208 --> 00:36:50,083
至于拜师的事⋯
You want me to be your master?

409
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:51,917
拜你个头！
Forget it!

410
00:36:52,250 --> 00:36:55,750
你们这些住香港岛的小朋友骄生惯养
You city kids are all spoiled…

411
00:36:55,875 --> 00:36:57,708
怎么吃得苦？
Good for nothing!

412
00:36:57,833 --> 00:37:00,000
想跟珊珊般得奥运金牌？
You want to get an Olympic medal too?

413
00:37:00,083 --> 00:37:02,000
别作梦了！
Dream on!

414
00:37:05,333 --> 00:37:09,000
小朋友，你看！
Kiddo, look!

415
00:37:15,375 --> 00:37:16,167
这个⋯
This calf…

416
00:37:16,333 --> 00:37:21,292
这脚瓜⋯好粗好大！比一节瓜还要大！
So thick, so strong!

417
00:37:21,417 --> 00:37:23,667
脚瓜的肌肉非常结实⋯
And so muscular!

418
00:37:23,875 --> 00:37:27,167
青筋凸现，钢线似的
With steely veins running down…

419
00:37:27,625 --> 00:37:30,833
每一条脚毛都硬似铁钉
Hair sticking out like wire…

420
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:35,042
脚趾甲有一寸厚，究竟⋯
And those tough toenails!

421
00:37:35,208 --> 00:37:36,667
要行过几多座山⋯
How many hills must it travel…

422
00:37:36,833 --> 00:37:38,208
跨过几多个海⋯
How many seas must it pass…

423
00:37:38,375 --> 00:37:39,792
吃过几多苦头⋯
How much pain must it bear…

424
00:37:39,917 --> 00:37:44,875
才可以练成这举世无双的脚瓜？
Before a calf becomes a calf?

425
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:51,583
我⋯我一定要练成这脚瓜！
I shall have this calf!

426
00:37:51,875 --> 00:37:52,917
师傅！
Master!

427
00:37:57,125 --> 00:37:59,667
我可以去小个便吗？
Can I take a pee?

428
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:07,250
每次唱这首歌，我都会急小便
Whenever I sing this song, I need to pee.

429
00:38:07,875 --> 00:38:11,375
现在先去，一回恐怕还是会急
Taking a pee first would not help.

430
00:38:11,875 --> 00:38:14,542
但是我现在一定要唱这首歌
But I must sing it now.

431
00:38:14,708 --> 00:38:17,708
希望可以改变黎根对我的看法
With this song, I hope…

432
00:38:18,125 --> 00:38:20,333
我要用这歌打动黎根
Logan will think better of me.

433
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:22,958
我要黎根收我做徒弟！
Logan will be my master!

434
00:38:23,125 --> 00:38:25,917
歌，是这样唱的⋯
The song goes like this…

435
00:38:26,042 --> 00:38:27,542
「大包，整多两笼」
"Big bun, have two more…"

436
00:38:27,667 --> 00:38:29,417
「大包，整多两笼」
"Big bun, have two more…"

437
00:38:29,542 --> 00:38:33,250
「大包，整多两笼唔怕滞」
"Forget about indigestion."

438
00:38:33,375 --> 00:38:35,083
「大包，整多两笼」
"Big bun, have two more…"

439
00:38:35,208 --> 00:38:36,875
「大包，整多两笼」
"Big bun, have two more…"

440
00:38:37,042 --> 00:38:40,667
「大包，整多两笼唔怕滞」
"Forget about indigestion."

441
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,583
「大包，整多两笼」
"Big bun, have two more…"

442
00:38:42,708 --> 00:38:44,500
「大包，整多两笼」
"Big bun, have two more…"

443
00:38:44,667 --> 00:38:48,875
「大包，整多两笼唔怕滞」
"Forget about indigestion."

444
00:38:49,167 --> 00:38:54,333
「食晒个包，脚瓜大个」
"Eat the bun, grow a calf…"

445
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:57,542
「孝顺我阿妈」
"Respect my mother."

446
00:38:58,375 --> 00:39:03,750
「食晒个包，脚瓜硬朗」
"Eat the bun, toughen my calf…"

447
00:39:03,917 --> 00:39:07,333
「再奉献国家」
"Serve my country."

448
00:39:08,458 --> 00:39:10,000
「大包，整多两笼」
"Big bun, have two more…"

449
00:39:10,125 --> 00:39:11,875
「大包，整多两笼」
"Big bun, have two more…"

450
00:39:12,042 --> 00:39:15,500
「大包，整多两笼唔怕滞」
"Forget about indigestion."

451
00:39:15,708 --> 00:39:17,667
「大包，整多两笼」
"Big bun, have two more…"

452
00:39:17,792 --> 00:39:19,458
「大包，整多两笼」
"Big bun, have two more…"

453
00:39:19,625 --> 00:39:24,792
「大包，整多两笼唔怕滞」
"Forget about indigestion."

454
00:39:28,583 --> 00:39:32,875
黎根听完歌以后，表情有点古怪⋯
Logan looks strange after the song.

455
00:39:33,542 --> 00:39:36,958
我一定要好好把握这个机会
I must grab my chance.

456
00:39:37,417 --> 00:39:39,833
师傅！你收我做徒弟吧！
Master! Please be my master!

457
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,750
你唔收我做徒弟，我一世都这么跪着！
Or let me kneel here forever!

458
00:39:43,875 --> 00:39:46,042
起来呀！
Get up…

459
00:39:46,167 --> 00:39:47,250
多谢师傅！
Thank you master!

460
00:39:47,417 --> 00:39:50,167
不⋯我是叫你扶我起来呀！
Silly, help me get up.

461
00:39:50,333 --> 00:39:57,875
不成了！我的脚瓜太痹了！
My calf has gone numb!

462
00:40:07,833 --> 00:40:10,917
我将今天发生的事讲给妈妈听
I tell mother what happened today.

463
00:40:11,625 --> 00:40:14,333
妈妈一句话也没说
She won't say a word…

464
00:40:14,458 --> 00:40:18,250
从冰箱内拿了只雪鸡出来解冻
But starts to defreeze a chicken.

465
00:40:20,667 --> 00:40:24,500
晚饭时，妈妈倒了三杯米酒
At dinner, mother offers 3 glasses of wine…

466
00:40:24,833 --> 00:40:30,333
又将几只橙和蒸好的鸡放到祖先前
Oranges and the chicken to the ancestral tablet.

467
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:34,250
妈妈叫我跪低，向祖先请请。
Mother then tells me to kneel down.

468
00:40:34,667 --> 00:40:38,458
妈妈跟着又念念有词的
She mumbles something when…

469
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:44,292
然后我们一起向祖先再拜了几拜
We pay our respect to our ancestors.

470
00:40:45,708 --> 00:40:49,875
妈妈蹲低把酒洒到地上
As mother pours the wine on the floor…

471
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,750
庄重而温柔地跟我说：
She says in her solemn, tender voice:

472
00:40:52,875 --> 00:40:54,750
以后生生性性
Be good,

473
00:40:55,208 --> 00:40:58,667
跟师傅学习，光宗耀祖！
learn with the master and honour the ancestors.

474
00:41:05,625 --> 00:41:10,083
妈妈在长洲找了间酒楼摆拜师宴
In honour of my master, mother throws a banquet.

475
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,583
因为我是师傅最后一个入室弟子
As I am the last disciple of the master…

476
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:18,125
到贺的乡绅父老特别多
Everyone on Cheung Chau comes.

477
00:41:18,792 --> 00:41:21,333
想不到黄德森也来了
San San's lover thinks…

478
00:41:21,542 --> 00:41:24,083
还赞我背上的肉厚
I have a nice thick back.

479
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:28,292
珊珊因为去了集训，没来
San San is in training and couldn't come.

480
00:41:28,458 --> 00:41:31,333
麦唛，菇时跟得巴都来了
All my mates are there too…

481
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:35,292
还带着成绩表，奖牌和大包
Bringing school report, medals and big buns.

482
00:41:35,708 --> 00:41:39,875
他们都希望黎根也可以收他们做徒弟
They hope Logan will take them in also.

483
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,542
吃过鸡丝翅，就是拜师仪式
After the soup, the ceremony begins.

484
00:41:44,708 --> 00:41:49,292
妈妈倒了杯茶给我，让我给师傅喝
Mother pours a cup of tea and I offer it to the master.

485
00:41:49,458 --> 00:41:53,125
我千辛万苦来长洲找黎根⋯
After all the hardship looking for Logan…

486
00:41:53,250 --> 00:41:58,208
我终于可以跟珊珊一起练滑浪风帆了！
Now I can windsurf together with San San!

487
00:42:00,958 --> 00:42:04,458
我将茶递给黎根，黎根他⋯
I offer the tea to Logan…

488
00:42:05,167 --> 00:42:10,292
师傅他把茶喝了，正式收我做徒弟
He drinks the tea and becomes my master.

489
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,917
宾客们好像都很高兴
All the guests look happy.

490
00:42:13,042 --> 00:42:17,833
长洲的乡绅父老拍掌拍得特别落力
And everyone from Cheung Chau applauds.

491
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:21,833
多谢各位赏面！多谢各位！
Thank you for honouring me!

492
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,875
在下平生有两项称得上得意的绝技
In my life, I have two skills that I'm proud of.

493
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,958
第一项，是滑浪风帆！
One is windsurfing.

494
00:42:29,083 --> 00:42:32,875
我把它传给外甥女珊珊了
That I have passed onto San San.

495
00:42:33,042 --> 00:42:37,708
另一项绝技，我打算传给这个新徒弟⋯
The other, I shall pass onto my new disciple…

496
00:42:37,875 --> 00:42:41,958
希望他把长洲人世世代代的绝技
Let him show the world…

497
00:42:42,083 --> 00:42:44,458
发扬光大！
what a marvelous skill that is!

498
00:42:46,292 --> 00:42:48,583
请问那是什么绝技呢？
Can you tell us what skill is that?

499
00:42:55,958 --> 00:42:59,083
第二项绝技，就是⋯
That is…

500
00:42:59,542 --> 00:43:02,333
抢包山！
Bun snatching!

501
00:43:08,792 --> 00:43:10,750
抢包山？
Bun snatching?

502
00:43:12,292 --> 00:43:15,542
年轻观众可能不知「抢包山」何物
"Bun Snatching", for our uninformed audience…

503
00:43:16,292 --> 00:43:19,833
抢包山乃长洲独有传统节日
Is a unique Cheung Chau tradition.

504
00:43:20,625 --> 00:43:22,167
每年农历四月
Each year, in the fourth month,

505
00:43:22,333 --> 00:43:25,125
长洲居民均举办太平清醮
Cheung Chau people…

506
00:43:25,958 --> 00:43:28,667
于北帝庙前搭起三座包山
Set up 3 stacks of bun to celebrate.

507
00:43:29,750 --> 00:43:31,333
什么是包山呢？
Stacks of bun?

508
00:43:31,792 --> 00:43:32,875
顾名思义⋯
Literally speaking…

509
00:43:33,083 --> 00:43:38,375
包山就是一座由好多好多包砌起的山！
A stack of bun is a stack of many buns!

510
00:43:38,750 --> 00:43:41,958
一座包山，起码六、七层楼高⋯
Each stack coming up to 6, 7 storeys.

511
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:46,208
你可以想像一下包山有多高了吧？
Imagine how high that is.

512
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:51,875
抢包山，就是要把包山上的包抢到手！
Bun snatching is to snatch those buns!

513
00:43:52,542 --> 00:43:53,917
锣鼓响起
When the time comes,

514
00:43:54,125 --> 00:43:58,167
数以百计的青年一涌而上抢包
hundreds of youth would rush up…

515
00:43:58,292 --> 00:44:02,292
抢得位置愈高的包，就是愈大的祝福
The higher the bun you snatch, the more blessed you are.

516
00:44:02,417 --> 00:44:05,833
更可以表现自己的不凡身手
And the more praise you get.

517
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:11,792
在1978年两座包山忽然倒下，多人重伤
In 1978, 2 stacks tumbled down, hurting many.

518
00:44:11,958 --> 00:44:14,417
「抢包山」从此被禁！
"Bun Snatching" was thus banned!

519
00:44:14,583 --> 00:44:18,583
而长洲独有的传统，亦渐被遗忘
And the unique tradition is lost.

520
00:44:22,167 --> 00:44:26,125
奥运金牌⋯这一世是没有机会的了
The Olympic medal… it has slipped away.

521
00:44:26,833 --> 00:44:30,250
每个星期六我都搭船过长洲
Every Saturday, I'd take a ferry to Cheung Chau…

522
00:44:30,583 --> 00:44:32,375
去学抢包山⋯
to practice bun snatching.

523
00:44:32,583 --> 00:44:36,125
一项没有奖牌，没有对手，没有比赛⋯
A game with no medal, no competitor, no competition…

524
00:44:36,542 --> 00:44:39,958
甚至没有人知道是运动的运动
A game nobody knows of.

525
00:44:41,292 --> 00:44:44,583
更坏的是，连包山也没有！
A game with no bun to snatch!

526
00:44:45,583 --> 00:44:48,208
师傅只是叫我去他的家⋯
All I do is to go to the master's home…

527
00:44:48,417 --> 00:44:51,000
在组合柜爬来爬去
and crawl around the shelf.

528
00:44:52,375 --> 00:44:55,417
碰！三番！
My win!

529
00:44:55,583 --> 00:44:58,208
别躲懒！继续练！
Keep going, lazy bone!

530
00:45:00,833 --> 00:45:04,250
一天，珊珊到了师传家！
One day, San San arrives!

531
00:45:04,375 --> 00:45:06,875
珊珊！我的师姐珊珊！
San San, my idol!

532
00:45:07,042 --> 00:45:08,333
可以看见珊珊⋯
Seeing San San…

533
00:45:08,458 --> 00:45:11,583
这几个星期爬得再辛苦也是值得的！
Makes me forget all these weeks' hard work.

534
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:13,792
珊珊！
San San!

535
00:45:13,958 --> 00:45:16,125
珊你个头！继续练习！
San yourself! Work!

536
00:45:24,083 --> 00:45:25,375
还不去？
You hear me?

537
00:45:26,417 --> 00:45:29,333
珊珊没看见我这个师弟
So San San leaves without seeing me.

538
00:45:29,667 --> 00:45:33,667
我只有死死气再爬上组合柜
In despair, I crawl up the shelf.

539
00:45:35,167 --> 00:45:39,458
我咁大个仔，什么「头」也给骂过⋯
I have had a lot of things said to me…

540
00:45:39,708 --> 00:45:40,708
不知道为什么
but "San yourself"…

541
00:45:40,792 --> 00:45:43,833
「珊你个头」却特别刺耳
hurts like never before.

542
00:45:43,958 --> 00:45:45,333
我⋯我⋯
I… I…

543
00:45:45,417 --> 00:45:48,083
我唔学抢包山了！
I am quitting!

544
00:46:10,708 --> 00:46:15,083
其实今天是我第一次近距离见黎根
Today is the first time I sit down with Logan.

545
00:46:15,750 --> 00:46:18,083
他恐怕都有五十岁了
He must be around 50,

546
00:46:18,208 --> 00:46:20,208
却还是一副孩子脸
with a baby face.

547
00:46:20,333 --> 00:46:22,208
鸡尾包！新鲜出炉！
Fresh from the oven!

548
00:46:25,667 --> 00:46:27,750
其实鸡尾包呢⋯
This thing…

549
00:46:28,333 --> 00:46:31,167
你说这似不似鸡尾？
What does it look like?

550
00:46:36,917 --> 00:46:39,500
麦兜他学东西⋯还可以
Dull… he's not a bad student.

551
00:46:39,667 --> 00:46:42,125
黎根接着说了一大堆话⋯
Logan then proceeds to tell me a lot…

552
00:46:42,583 --> 00:46:46,208
他的抱负，他对麦兜的期望
His ambition, his expectation of Dull.

553
00:46:46,583 --> 00:46:51,125
他说他会把他所识的毫不保留教给麦兜
He says he'll teach all he knows to Dull.

554
00:46:51,708 --> 00:46:53,708
黎根越说越兴奋，直到双眼发光
The more he talks, the more excited he gets.

555
00:46:53,792 --> 00:46:57,167
他又说滑浪风帆并不是他最犀利的项目
He tells me windsurfing is not his strongest.

556
00:46:57,417 --> 00:47:00,250
他最大强项是抢包山
His strongest is really bun snatching…

557
00:47:00,833 --> 00:47:03,625
他说抢包山结合了南拳
Something combining Fist,

558
00:47:03,750 --> 00:47:06,458
神功戏和现代器械操
ritual and gymnastic.

559
00:47:06,750 --> 00:47:11,500
他说抢包山才是他一生最大成就
He says bun snatching is his lifelong achievement.

560
00:47:11,625 --> 00:47:13,542
缩脚，唔该！
Move your feet!

561
00:47:15,625 --> 00:47:17,333
你看！
Look!

562
00:47:18,875 --> 00:47:24,542
这脚瓜⋯好粗好大！比一节瓜还要大！
This calf… so thick, so strong!

563
00:47:24,708 --> 00:47:26,667
脚瓜的肌肉非常结实⋯
And so muscular!

564
00:47:26,833 --> 00:47:30,125
青筋凸现，钢线似的
With steely veins running down…

565
00:47:30,708 --> 00:47:33,875
每一条脚毛都硬似铁钉
Hair sticking out like wire…

566
00:47:34,042 --> 00:47:37,875
脚趾甲有一寸厚，究竟⋯
And those tough toenails!

567
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,667
要走过几多座山
How many hills must it travel…

568
00:47:39,792 --> 00:47:41,625
跨过几多个海
How many seas must it pass…

569
00:47:41,750 --> 00:47:43,125
吃过几多苦头
How much pain must it bear…

570
00:47:43,208 --> 00:47:47,500
才可以练成这举世无双的脚瓜？
Before a calf becomes a calf?

571
00:47:53,292 --> 00:47:54,000
我个仔⋯
My son…

572
00:47:54,125 --> 00:47:57,750
你个仔，他日都会有这只大脚瓜
Your son, he will get this calf.

573
00:47:58,042 --> 00:48:01,583
其实我也不知道个仔要这么粗的脚瓜⋯
I have no idea why would Dull need…

574
00:48:01,708 --> 00:48:02,958
有什么用
such a calf.

575
00:48:03,125 --> 00:48:07,542
可是看见那些凸现的青筋，不知怎样⋯
But, looking at those steely veins…

576
00:48:08,042 --> 00:48:12,542
我想起麦兜的爸爸，阿炳。
I am reminded of Dull's pa, Bing.

577
00:48:21,042 --> 00:48:26,375
我找来找去也找不到那部电子英文辞典
The electronic dictionary cannot be found.

578
00:48:26,542 --> 00:48:28,000
跑哪去了？
Where could it be?

579
00:48:28,125 --> 00:48:31,792
难道⋯不会吧？
Could it be that… ?

580
00:48:36,750 --> 00:48:40,875
想不到真的让妈妈拿去了。吓得我！
So mother has been using the dictionary?

581
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,958
妈妈怎么会写起英文信？
But why is she writing in English?

582
00:48:44,417 --> 00:48:45,583
信很短
The letter is short.

583
00:48:45,708 --> 00:48:52,042
我猜是妈妈用电子辞典逐个字译成英文
Mother must have translated it word by word.

584
00:48:52,167 --> 00:48:57,125
于是我又用电子辞典把信译回中文
I use the machine to turn it back into Chinese.

585
00:48:58,083 --> 00:49:03,000
信，是妈妈写给奥委会主席的
It is addressed to the Olympic Committee Chairman.

586
00:49:04,667 --> 00:49:06,083
「亲爱的主席：」
"Dear Chairman:"

587
00:49:06,250 --> 00:49:08,500
「你好吗？我很好！」
"How are you? I am fine."

588
00:49:08,667 --> 00:49:10,917
「你吃包吗？我吃包！」
"You like bun? I like bun!"

589
00:49:11,083 --> 00:49:15,292
「我们居住在香港这里的人，很爱吃包」
"We Hong Kong people here love bun."

590
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:19,917
「小笼包，上海包，广东包，莲蓉包」
"Buns of all sorts."

591
00:49:20,042 --> 00:49:22,125
「好朋友，我认为」
"Dear friend,"

592
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:25,125
抢劫那些包，十分重要！
"It is important to snatch buns."

593
00:49:25,250 --> 00:49:27,708
「也算是运动，就真！」
"It is a game, no joke."

594
00:49:27,958 --> 00:49:32,500
「要大力！大吃晚上的粥，和大节瓜！」
"One needs energy, and many night congee."

595
00:49:32,667 --> 00:49:34,708
「按照我愚蠢的见解⋯」
"In my stupid opinion…"

596
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:38,958
抢劫那些包，是奥运会比赛。
"Snatching bun is an Olympic game."

597
00:49:39,083 --> 00:49:41,958
让全世界的体育家，抢过！
"Let athletes all over the world snatch!"

598
00:49:42,125 --> 00:49:43,833
「世界便和平！」
"And there will be peace."

599
00:49:44,167 --> 00:49:45,667
「你有孩子吗？」
"Do you have children?"

600
00:49:45,792 --> 00:49:48,417
「我有一个孩子，麦兜」
"I have a boy, Dull."

601
00:49:48,750 --> 00:49:50,167
终于讲到我了！
She's talking about me!

602
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:54,125
「他是一个好男孩」
"He is a good boy."

603
00:49:54,292 --> 00:49:56,708
「他非常懂得抢劫那些包」
"He knows how to snatch buns."

604
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,792
「有一天，我看见他，抢劫包⋯」
"One day, I can see him snatching buns…"

605
00:50:00,083 --> 00:50:02,292
「抢了一个奥运金牌」
"Ending up snatching an Olympic medal."

606
00:50:02,583 --> 00:50:06,792
「那便是一个母亲能够有的最大的安慰」
"That is the biggest comfort a mother can get."

607
00:50:07,292 --> 00:50:11,167
「孩子的才干，得到了世界人类的知道」
"Let the world know the talent of your children."

608
00:50:11,833 --> 00:50:15,167
「父母愿意做什么的东西都得」
"Parents will do anything for that."

609
00:50:15,667 --> 00:50:19,333
「于是我写了这忽然间的信给你」
"That is why I write you this sudden letter."

610
00:50:19,542 --> 00:50:23,333
「虽然你不知道我是什么微细的东西」
"Although you don't know humble things like me."

611
00:50:23,625 --> 00:50:26,500
「但我的孩子很大，很大！」
"But my boy is big, very big."

612
00:50:26,667 --> 00:50:29,125
「有一天，你都会知道」
"One day, you will know him too."

613
00:50:29,875 --> 00:50:31,250
「多谢合作！」
"Thank you for your cooperation."

614
00:50:31,583 --> 00:50:34,917
「你忠实的，麦太」
"Yours faithfully, Mrs. Mc."

615
00:50:42,375 --> 00:50:43,833
看完妈妈的信
After reading mother's letter…

616
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:47,000
我决定回长洲继续学捡包山
I go back to Cheung Chau to practice.

617
00:50:48,417 --> 00:50:50,458
我不是为了见珊珊
Not because of San San.

618
00:50:50,958 --> 00:50:53,042
我并不知道为什么要抢那些包
I don't know why I want to snatch a bun.

619
00:50:53,667 --> 00:50:57,042
我也不相信抢包山会成为奥运项目
And I don't think it will ever become an Olympic sport.

620
00:50:57,708 --> 00:51:01,042
可是，我依然努力练习抢包山
But I keep learning.

621
00:51:01,625 --> 00:51:04,125
因为，我爱我妈妈
Because I love my mother.

622
00:51:05,542 --> 00:51:08,958
师傅说我攀爬功夫已经不错
Master thinks my crawling has passed.

623
00:51:09,458 --> 00:51:12,583
可以开始教我「十二路抢包手」
Now I'll learn the "12 Bun Snatching Hands".

624
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:16,042
师傅说当年师祖要出这套
Master says these 12 hands,

625
00:51:16,167 --> 00:51:17,958
「十二路抢包手」⋯
in its prime…

626
00:51:18,125 --> 00:51:21,042
连林世荣也大大赞好
Was much admired by Butcher Lin!

627
00:51:22,167 --> 00:51:24,000
后来麦嘎告诉我⋯
Later, I learn from McMug…

628
00:51:24,167 --> 00:51:28,375
林世荣即是猪肉荣，是黄飞鸿的徒弟
Butcher Lin was a disciple of the great Kung Fu king.

629
00:51:29,458 --> 00:51:32,458
我不知道师傅像不像黄飞鸿
I don't know much about Kung Fu kings…

630
00:51:32,833 --> 00:51:35,542
我却肯定像一块猪肉
But I must be the ultimate pork…

631
00:51:35,708 --> 00:51:37,708
我是一块堵住两个包
The pork that struts about

632
00:51:37,833 --> 00:51:40,458
在长洲转来转去的猪肉
with buns in hands.

633
00:51:41,458 --> 00:51:46,000
我一边练习，一边胡思乱想；始终⋯
My mind boggles as I practice, after all…

634
00:51:46,167 --> 00:51:48,458
我还是不大喜欢抢包
I am not a fan of bun snatching.

635
00:51:48,917 --> 00:51:50,750
我只是爱我妈妈
I am only doing this for mother.

636
00:51:50,875 --> 00:51:52,667
于是我咬实牙根⋯
Hence I hang on…

637
00:51:52,792 --> 00:51:55,000
一步一步，一爪一爪⋯
Step by step, claw by claw…

638
00:51:55,167 --> 00:51:59,833
我最后终于练成「十二路抢包手」
I make it pass the "12 Bun Snatching Hands".

639
00:52:21,208 --> 00:52:23,750
喂，我是麦兜
This is Dull.

640
00:52:23,833 --> 00:52:27,833
刚才的是小朋友麦兜，我是大个佬麦兜
Dull the big guy, not Dull the boy.

641
00:52:28,167 --> 00:52:31,667
小朋友麦兜和大个佬麦兜除了声音不同⋯
The two Dulls have different voices, and then…

642
00:52:32,167 --> 00:52:35,792
小朋友麦兜的世界仍然有好多幻想
Dull the boy's world is still filled with fantasy…

643
00:52:36,583 --> 00:52:38,125
仍然有好多希望
Filled with hopes.

644
00:52:38,583 --> 00:52:40,667
希望⋯失望⋯
Hope… Disappointment…

645
00:52:40,833 --> 00:52:42,250
希望⋯
Hope…

646
00:52:42,333 --> 00:52:43,625
失望
Disappointment.

647
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,167
久而久之，就变成大个佬麦兜
On and on, he became Dull the big guy.

648
00:52:47,292 --> 00:52:50,542
我现在还是多说点小朋友麦兜
But I shall tell more about Dull the boy.

649
00:52:51,125 --> 00:52:53,625
小朋友麦兜仍然希望希望⋯
Dull the boy hoped a lot.

650
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:56,417
希望真的有圣诞老人
He hoped there WAS a Santa Claus.

651
00:52:56,583 --> 00:53:00,042
而且好想试试圣诞火鸡的滋味
And he hoped to eat a Christmas turkey.

652
00:53:00,833 --> 00:53:03,958
对，那时我还没吃过火鸡
Right, I haven't eaten any turkey then.

653
00:53:04,250 --> 00:53:05,875
关于火鸡的一切⋯
Everything about turkey…

654
00:53:06,333 --> 00:53:08,417
圣诞树上一闪一闪的饰物
The sparkling tinkling Christmas tree…

655
00:53:08,708 --> 00:53:11,042
就像天上掉落的星星
Like stars falling from the sky…

656
00:53:11,250 --> 00:53:13,208
落到火炉旁边
Coming down by the fireplace.

657
00:53:14,208 --> 00:53:17,667
一片片比外边的雪还要白的鸡胸肉⋯
Each slice of meat looks purer than snow.

658
00:53:18,083 --> 00:53:19,708
就在我们跟前
Right in front of us…

659
00:53:20,458 --> 00:53:21,833
香气直入灵魂⋯
The aroma attacks our soul…

660
00:53:22,042 --> 00:53:25,292
连守在灵魂旁边的天使都醒过来
Waking even the guardian angels.

661
00:53:25,542 --> 00:53:28,750
围住这香而圣洁的肉⋯
Who float around the aromatic and holy dish…

662
00:53:29,417 --> 00:53:34,042
在圣诞夜中飞呀，飞⋯
Floating in the Christmas night, floating…

663
00:53:35,292 --> 00:53:39,917
这关于火鸡的一切，不过是我的想像
All this about turkey was only my imagination.

664
00:53:40,125 --> 00:53:42,417
我从来没吃过火鸡⋯
I had never eaten a turkey.

665
00:53:42,625 --> 00:53:44,667
连它的气味也没嗅过
I had never even smelt one.

666
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:47,125
妈妈说火鸡太大
Mother claimed turkey was too big.

667
00:53:47,708 --> 00:53:50,083
我们一家两口，吃不下
The two of us would never finish it.

668
00:53:50,417 --> 00:53:54,208
有年圣诞节妈妈买了半只烤鸭庆祝
One Christmas we celebrated with roast duck.

669
00:53:54,417 --> 00:53:56,792
当时的我，十分十分失望
I was really, really disappointed.

670
00:53:57,792 --> 00:54:00,333
又有一年，一间百货公司结业
Another year, she bought a mini-oven at 60% off…

671
00:54:00,875 --> 00:54:03,833
妈妈以四折买了个小小焗炉
At a closedown sale.

672
00:54:04,250 --> 00:54:06,500
可能因为买了焗炉而技痒
Thanks to the oven…

673
00:54:06,917 --> 00:54:08,292
那日妈妈竟然跟我说⋯
Mother decided one day…

674
00:54:08,417 --> 00:54:11,458
让我们明天去超级市场揪火鸡
We would go shopping for a turkey.

675
00:54:12,333 --> 00:54:14,917
我跟妈妈把火鸡揪回家的路上⋯
On the way home, with turkey in hand…

676
00:54:15,333 --> 00:54:18,667
是我生命中最开心的时刻
That was the happiest moment in my life.

677
00:54:20,292 --> 00:54:22,000
火鸡终于解冻了
The turkey was ready.

678
00:54:22,208 --> 00:54:24,542
我学着妈妈，把双手涂满盐⋯
Following mother, with salt on both hands…

679
00:54:25,083 --> 00:54:28,292
在火鸡丰厚的鸡胸上擦呀，擦
I rubbed the turkey's thick chest.

680
00:54:29,125 --> 00:54:30,000
联火鸡时⋯
When sewing up…

681
00:54:30,042 --> 00:54:33,750
妈妈不留神漏出了火鸡内的洋葱粒
Some of the stuffing…

682
00:54:33,875 --> 00:54:35,333
红萝卜粒
leaked out.

683
00:54:35,708 --> 00:54:37,333
我说：火鸡「疴烂煮」！
I cried: the turkey's stomach won't stop!

684
00:54:39,042 --> 00:54:41,333
好勉强把火鸡塞进焗炉内
We managed to stuff the turkey into the oven.

685
00:54:42,042 --> 00:54:43,500
12月24日
24th, December

686
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:47,625
上升的白烟跟奇异的焦味拨动星星
Rising smoke stirred the stars with a crunchy smell.

687
00:54:48,417 --> 00:54:51,583
焗炉戚戚恻恻，戚戚恻恻⋯
The oven hummed. Hummed.

688
00:54:52,167 --> 00:54:54,875
有如天使预早送来的福音
It was like early blessing from the angels.

689
00:55:03,625 --> 00:55:05,250
好靓的晚上啊！
Such a beautiful night!

690
00:55:05,542 --> 00:55:07,583
我和妈妈坐在尖东海傍
Mother and I sat at the seafront.

691
00:55:08,250 --> 00:55:12,042
点点灯光在海面走来走去⋯
Lights shimmered on the sea.

692
00:55:12,542 --> 00:55:14,958
美丽又温柔
Beautiful and gentle.

693
00:55:16,208 --> 00:55:18,000
真的好靓！
So beautiful!

694
00:55:48,042 --> 00:55:50,125
我从没吃过这么浓味的东西
I had never tasted anything so strong.

695
00:55:50,417 --> 00:55:53,625
甚至杯面，烧鸭的味道也没有这么浓
Cup noodles or roast duck were not as strong.

696
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:57,333
火鸡的味道把我每一个味蕾缠住⋯
The taste embedded every single taste bud…

697
00:55:58,250 --> 00:56:02,167
爆发⋯缠住⋯爆发⋯
Then exploded.

698
00:56:02,333 --> 00:56:03,958
就像今晚的一切
Like everything tonight…

699
00:56:04,458 --> 00:56:10,542
最靓最靓，最犀利，而且最温柔
Most beautiful, brilliant, and tender.

700
00:56:16,333 --> 00:56:18,125
第二天我睡得很晏⋯
I woke up late the next day.

701
00:56:18,417 --> 00:56:21,667
刷过牙我还感觉到火鸡的美味
The sweetness was still there after washing.

702
00:56:22,333 --> 00:56:23,625
因为早餐吃得晚⋯
As we had a late breakfast…

703
00:56:24,125 --> 00:56:27,583
午餐时妈妈只煮了罐栗米汤
There was only corn soup for lunch.

704
00:56:27,792 --> 00:56:29,958
我用汤匙撩了两下
I idly found diced turkey…

705
00:56:30,625 --> 00:56:33,000
竟然发现美味的火鸡粒
in the soup.

706
00:56:34,167 --> 00:56:37,083
不用说，那夜就是我渴望了⋯
That night finally came the long awaited…

707
00:56:37,208 --> 00:56:40,708
很久很久很久的⋯圣诞火鸡大餐！
Christmas turkey dinner!

708
00:56:40,875 --> 00:56:44,875
一片片的火鸡肉和伴碟的薯仔和节瓜⋯
Slices of meat, accompanied by gourd and potato…

709
00:56:45,083 --> 00:56:47,708
上面淋了老抽生粉献
Were dressed with soy sauce.

710
00:56:48,833 --> 00:56:52,000
我们真的好兴奋，好满足
It was an exciting, satisfactory moment for us.

711
00:56:52,333 --> 00:56:54,500
之后，我们吃了一个星期的⋯
The following week,

712
00:56:54,625 --> 00:56:57,000
火鸡三文治早餐
turkey sandwich for breakfast.

713
00:56:57,167 --> 00:56:58,083
星期天
Sunday,

714
00:56:58,208 --> 00:57:01,542
我大着胆跟妈妈说：不如去饮茶吖
I boldly suggested eating out.

715
00:57:01,792 --> 00:57:03,583
妈妈骂我「冇衣食」⋯
Mother said I was ungrateful…

716
00:57:03,708 --> 00:57:05,708
不过还是带了我去饮茶
But took me out anyway.

717
00:57:06,333 --> 00:57:08,292
之后，妈妈又有计⋯
Then mother got inspired again.

718
00:57:08,625 --> 00:57:12,083
她把冰箱内剩下来的火鸡肉撕呀撕
What was left of the turkey was sliced…

719
00:57:12,208 --> 00:57:14,625
有时候也叫我帮手撕
With me helping out at times.

720
00:57:15,208 --> 00:57:16,917
火鸡留在指甲的味道
It was not easy to get rid of…

721
00:57:17,542 --> 00:57:20,208
原来得洗好多次
the turkey's smell.

722
00:57:22,958 --> 00:57:25,667
银芽火鸡丝炒米，好味道
Fried noodle with sliced turkey, yummy.

723
00:57:26,167 --> 00:57:28,250
栗子炆火鸡丝㷛
Steaming chestnut bowl with sliced turkey.

724
00:57:29,375 --> 00:57:31,583
花生火鸡骨煲粥
Peanut congee with turkey bone.

725
00:57:31,750 --> 00:57:33,583
纸包火鸡包包纸
Paper turkey bun.

726
00:57:34,250 --> 00:57:36,542
包火鸡包包包火鸡包
Paper turkey paper bun.

727
00:57:37,125 --> 00:57:39,667
酿火鸡馅搽面包
Turkey pete with bread.

728
00:57:40,625 --> 00:57:46,625
唉，我好后悔讲过一句「火鸡疴烂煮」
I shouldn't have said anything about the turkey's stomach.

729
00:57:46,917 --> 00:57:51,208
端午节，当我翻开我最喜欢吃的裹蒸粽⋯
Came Dragon Boat Festival, when I dug into the dumpling…

730
00:57:51,375 --> 00:57:55,792
发现咸蛋旁边是一件火鸡背的时候⋯
And found more pieces of turkey…

731
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:59,667
我脑部一时想唔通，哭起来
I lost it. I cried.

732
00:58:00,292 --> 00:58:01,792
救命呀！
Oh please!

733
00:58:02,792 --> 00:58:05,875
妈妈悄悄把剩下的火鸡扔掉
When mother finally disposed of the turkey…

734
00:58:06,167 --> 00:58:10,417
那已经是火鸡解冻后差不多半年的事
It was already half a year later.

735
00:58:10,542 --> 00:58:14,542
我的美梦跟恶梦亦同时完结
My beautiful dream ended with my nightmare.

736
00:58:15,125 --> 00:58:16,625
后来我才知道⋯
Later, I learned that…

737
00:58:16,792 --> 00:58:18,625
一只火鸡由出世到给人宰掉
A serving turkey needs only be raised…

738
00:58:18,792 --> 00:58:21,083
也不过是几个月间的事
For a few months.

739
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:25,417
即是说，火鸡死掉后跟我们一起的日子
The time the turkey spent with us…

740
00:58:25,625 --> 00:58:28,208
还要长过它的一生
Was in fact longer than its life.

741
00:58:28,833 --> 00:58:31,417
我还发觉，火鸡的味道⋯
I realized also, with turkey…

742
00:58:31,583 --> 00:58:35,792
将吃未吃和第一口之间已经是最高峰
Taking the first bite is all that matters.

743
00:58:36,333 --> 00:58:40,083
之后的，不过是开始了也就吃下去
Afterwards, it is just "be over and done with".

744
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:43,333
我没有哲学家的头脑⋯
I am no philosopher.

745
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:46,542
不知道两件事情应该得出什么道理
I could not come up with any profundity.

746
00:58:47,542 --> 00:58:49,208
可是这些想法⋯
But, such thoughts…

747
00:58:49,375 --> 00:58:50,750
在我长大后⋯
After I grew up…

748
00:58:51,750 --> 00:58:54,042
在一些跟圣诞节无关的日子⋯
On days unrelated to Christmas…

749
00:58:54,875 --> 00:58:58,292
毫无因由的在我脑中出现过三两次
Did come up again a couple of times.

750
00:59:00,333 --> 00:59:03,708
一次，是在我自己的婚宴上
Once, it was at my wedding.

751
00:59:04,208 --> 00:59:05,500
一次⋯
Once…

752
00:59:05,667 --> 00:59:07,917
是在我妈妈火化那天
It was at my mother's cremation.

753
00:59:08,875 --> 00:59:12,833
那天，我看着天空几缕灰色的烟。
That day, I was looking at the smoke rising up.

754
00:59:13,625 --> 00:59:16,792
忽然间嗅到火鸡又浓又淡的气味
Suddenly, the smell of the turkey returned.

755
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:22,542
我好后悔要妈妈扔掉最后几件火鸡。
I regretted I made mother throw the turkey away.

756
01:00:21,833 --> 01:00:23,208
特别报告
"Special Report"

757
01:00:23,417 --> 01:00:28,000
奥运金牌得主李丽珊决定参加今届奥运
Olympic medal winner San San Li will compete again…

758
01:00:28,125 --> 01:00:29,792
向全世界人再次证明⋯
To prove to the world that…

759
01:00:29,917 --> 01:00:32,542
香港运动员不是腊鸭
HK athletes are horrible.

760
01:00:33,167 --> 01:00:34,083
另方面⋯
Also…

761
01:00:34,208 --> 01:00:37,625
香港体运总会霍震霆⋯
The local federation…

762
01:00:37,750 --> 01:00:40,000
正式向亚运协会提出申请
officially announced today:

763
01:00:40,125 --> 01:00:43,542
香港将争夺下届亚运会主办权
HK will apply to host the Asian Games.

764
01:00:44,250 --> 01:00:47,458
多个运动团体立即表示热烈支持
The response from all sides has been enthusiastic.

765
01:00:48,292 --> 01:00:50,792
其中港九新界竹战联谊会⋯
Among them, the Bamboo Game Association…

766
01:00:50,958 --> 01:00:53,875
更希望打麻将可以成为亚运项目
is proposing Mahjong for official game.

767
01:00:54,375 --> 01:00:57,000
另外，全港茶餐厅员工协会⋯
While Tearoom Serving Groups…

768
01:00:57,125 --> 01:00:58,458
经已发动所有会员⋯
have vowed…

769
01:00:58,625 --> 01:01:02,458
争取「掷蛋挞」成为亚运比赛项目
To campaign for "Tart Throwing".

770
01:01:02,917 --> 01:01:05,125
港九烧味卤味腊味同业会
As for the Cold Cut and Roasting Association…

771
01:01:05,250 --> 01:01:07,500
亦向霍主席当面提出⋯
They believe…

772
01:01:07,667 --> 01:01:11,000
「挂腊鸭」可以成为亚运比赛项目
"Duck Hanging" would make an ideal addition.

773
01:01:12,042 --> 01:01:15,958
较为特别的是，CIC保险营业员联同⋯
More interesting, CIC Insurance is joining forces with…

774
01:01:16,083 --> 01:01:17,958
大角咀春田花花幼稚园⋯
Children from…

775
01:01:18,125 --> 01:01:20,167
附属小学一班小朋友⋯
Spring Flower Primary School…

776
01:01:20,333 --> 01:01:22,333
争取「抢包山」
In support of…

777
01:01:22,708 --> 01:01:24,375
一项几乎绝迹的运动⋯
"Bun Snatching"…

778
01:01:24,542 --> 01:01:28,542
成为本港举办亚运的重点推介比赛项目
A game thought extinct.

779
01:02:30,917 --> 01:02:32,042
最后⋯
In the end…

780
01:02:32,500 --> 01:02:34,875
最后，一切成烟
Nothing came of anything.

781
01:02:35,375 --> 01:02:38,875
最后，他们选了「掷蛋挞」做推介项目
"Tart Throwing" was chosen as the highlight.

782
01:02:39,125 --> 01:02:41,458
至于香港争取申办亚运的口号⋯
As for the official slogan…

783
01:02:41,625 --> 01:02:45,542
亦顺理成章叫成「香港一蛋挞」
"HK, One Big Tart" was a logical choice.

784
01:02:47,292 --> 01:02:49,625
之后李丽珊蝉联失败⋯
Then San San Li lost.

785
01:02:51,917 --> 01:02:53,000
亚运主办权⋯
And the hosting right of the Asian Games…

786
01:02:53,125 --> 01:02:56,375
亦由一个香港人从未听过的地方夺得
Went to a place Hong Kong people have never heard of.

787
01:02:58,500 --> 01:03:01,625
想着转行当运动员的茶餐厅伙记⋯
Tearoom workers, those aspiring athletes…

788
01:03:01,750 --> 01:03:05,292
都回到茶餐厅继续掷他们的蛋挞
Went back to where they used to throw their tarts.

789
01:03:05,417 --> 01:03:07,083
一切回复正常
Everything went on as usual.

790
01:03:12,375 --> 01:03:15,792
上中学后，我再没有练习抢包手
In secondary school, I stopped practicing the 12 hands.

791
01:03:16,917 --> 01:03:18,500
有时候跟妈妈饮茶⋯
Sometimes, when I went out with mother…

792
01:03:18,667 --> 01:03:21,542
我都会手快快替她抢一笼大包
I'd still snatch a bun for her.

793
01:03:22,875 --> 01:03:25,250
之后，茶楼再不卖大包了
Then they stopped selling buns.

794
01:03:26,167 --> 01:03:28,708
点心车亦转成点心纸
Carts were replaced by ordering sheets.

795
01:03:29,417 --> 01:03:31,542
一切落空
Everything came to nothing.

796
01:03:42,333 --> 01:03:45,458
有时候我也会跟同学回到长洲烧烤
At times, I'd go to Cheung Chau for barbecue.

797
01:03:45,958 --> 01:03:47,542
每次看见师傅⋯
The master looked older…

798
01:03:47,792 --> 01:03:49,708
他都好像老了一点
Each time I saw him.

799
01:03:54,250 --> 01:03:55,542
因为环保⋯
For environmental reasons…

800
01:03:55,708 --> 01:03:58,958
长洲的抢包都转为塑胶
They'd changed to snatching plastic buns.

801
01:04:00,125 --> 01:04:03,417
师傅说，那阵胶气，相当臭
Master thought they stunk.

802
01:04:09,250 --> 01:04:11,417
长洲有个张保仔洞
On Cheung Chau was a Cheung Po Tsai Cave.

803
01:04:11,792 --> 01:04:15,792
听说张保仔在洞内藏了很多宝藏
Where legend claimed a pirate hid his treasure.

804
01:04:16,958 --> 01:04:20,500
因为我练过抢包手，身手比较灵活⋯
As I was the one who could crawl…

805
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:25,250
同学们叫我爬进去看看，说不定会发达
My mates said I should take a look and maybe get rich.

806
01:04:25,417 --> 01:04:29,042
于是我就向着这个又黑又窄的洞⋯
So I crawled along the dark and narrow cave.

807
01:04:29,333 --> 01:04:32,417
一直爬
Crawling.

808
01:04:32,917 --> 01:04:36,708
洞里面什么也没有，只有一个盒
There was nothing but a box.

809
01:04:37,250 --> 01:04:39,000
我小心揭开盒⋯
I opened the box…

810
01:04:39,167 --> 01:04:42,417
发现里面一个没吃完的大包
Inside, there was an unfinished bun.

811
01:04:43,167 --> 01:04:45,667
是不是张保仔吃过的呢？
Maybe the pirate didn't get to finish it.

812
01:04:46,958 --> 01:04:55,542
「寻晚，食了六个餐包」
"Eating 6 buns last night…"

813
01:04:55,667 --> 01:05:04,500
「可惜我依然系觉得仍未十分饱」
"Still left me hungry."

814
01:05:05,333 --> 01:05:13,250
「寻晚，食了磅半方包」
"Eating 1½ lb white bread last night…"

815
01:05:13,417 --> 01:05:24,792
「可叹是我依然觉得，不够顶肚」
"Still left me hungry."

816
01:05:26,750 --> 01:05:35,042
「年少，练了六套脚法。」
"Excelled 6 sets of steps when I was young…"

817
01:05:35,208 --> 01:05:42,458
「可惜我依然未觉够用。」
"Still left me empty."

818
01:05:44,042 --> 01:05:57,375
「年晚，又培育了珊珊！可惜⋯」
"Brought up San San when I am old! Still…"

819
01:05:57,917 --> 01:06:01,292
揸住个包，我忽然明白⋯
Bun in hand, I suddenly realized…

820
01:06:02,333 --> 01:06:06,292
原来有些事情， 没有就是没有
There are things that cannot be forced.

821
01:06:07,125 --> 01:06:09,292
唔得，就是唔得
A no is a no.

822
01:06:10,458 --> 01:06:14,083
没有鱼蛋没有粗面没去成马尔代夫⋯
No fishball, no noodle, no Maldives…

823
01:06:14,250 --> 01:06:16,500
没有奖牌没有张保仔宝藏
No medal, no pirate's treasure.

824
01:06:17,250 --> 01:06:20,542
而张保仔，也没有咬过那个包
And the pirate took no bite.

825
01:06:21,167 --> 01:06:24,292
原来蠢，并不那么好笑
Stupid is not funny.

826
01:06:25,583 --> 01:06:27,000
蠢会失败⋯
Stupid leads to failure…

827
01:06:27,708 --> 01:06:29,083
会失望
To disappointment.

828
01:06:30,625 --> 01:06:33,333
失望，并不那么好笑
Disappointed is not funny.

829
01:06:34,208 --> 01:06:36,208
肥，都不一定好笑
Fatness is not funny too.

830
01:06:37,500 --> 01:06:39,667
肥，不一定大力
Fatness is not powerful.

831
01:06:39,875 --> 01:06:41,917
大力，亦不一定得
Power doesn't mean yes.

832
01:06:44,667 --> 01:06:47,208
揸住个包，我忽然想⋯
Bun in hand, I suddenly thought…

833
01:06:47,583 --> 01:06:50,042
长大了，到我要面对这个实掘掘⋯
Growing up, facing this sordid world…

834
01:06:50,750 --> 01:06:53,417
未必可以发梦，未必那么好笑的⋯
This not so dreamy, not so funny world…

835
01:06:53,583 --> 01:06:57,625
世界的时候，我会怎么样？
What shall I be?

836
01:07:05,375 --> 01:07:16,417
「⋯无力挽！」
"… Nothing shall be done!"

837
01:07:42,250 --> 01:07:44,542
橙
"Powerful"

838
01:08:19,458 --> 01:08:22,333
是的，我就是大个佬麦兜
Right, I am McDull the big guy.

839
01:08:23,542 --> 01:08:26,500
肥，算大力
Fat, with raw power.

840
01:08:27,083 --> 01:08:28,958
麻麻地可以
Not doing too well.

841
01:08:29,750 --> 01:08:31,333
负家产
Negative property.

842
01:08:34,042 --> 01:08:38,292
脚爪是真的大，比一节瓜还要大
With a pair of really thick calves.

843
01:08:39,250 --> 01:08:41,917
脚瓜上的肌肉非常结实⋯
Very muscular…

844
01:08:42,375 --> 01:08:47,083
青筋一条条凸出来，似钢筋
With steely veins running down.

845
01:08:47,917 --> 01:08:50,000
至于脚趾甲⋯
As for the toenails…

846
01:08:50,333 --> 01:08:53,417
有次我无无聊聊真的量了一下⋯
I got bored one time and stared at it…

847
01:08:53,833 --> 01:08:56,750
足有一寸厚
They're tough, no kidding!

848
01:08:58,458 --> 01:09:00,958
是的，故事讲完了
Yes, the story ends here.

849
01:09:01,708 --> 01:09:03,500
这是一个尝试
This is a try.

850
01:09:04,375 --> 01:09:07,417
失败⋯尝试⋯
Error… Try…

851
01:09:07,917 --> 01:09:11,458
好多包⋯可是没有包保成功的故事
No guarantee that one would make it.

852
01:09:12,875 --> 01:09:14,500
故事说了一轮⋯
In the end…

853
01:09:14,917 --> 01:09:18,042
什么也没有？也不是
Zero gain? Not really.

854
01:09:18,625 --> 01:09:21,667
就是大了双脚瓜
I have my calves.

855
01:09:23,083 --> 01:09:25,792
可是楝一双脚瓜站这儿⋯
But, standing here like this…

856
01:09:26,250 --> 01:09:28,250
当浪打过来⋯
When the waves hit…

857
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:32,250
那感觉还真不错
I feel great.

858
01:09:34,167 --> 01:09:37,083
你知道我麻麻地叻佬，不懂得⋯
You see, smart guys like me don't really know…

859
01:09:37,250 --> 01:09:41,500
替自己的故事加点教训呀锦囊呀那些
How to make a lesson out of his own story.

860
01:09:42,042 --> 01:09:44,833
可是，浸一双脚瓜站水中⋯
With calves in water…

861
01:09:45,292 --> 01:09:50,417
当风吹向我的脑，我会想⋯
When the wind blows, I'd think…

862
01:09:50,750 --> 01:09:53,167
如果妈妈看见我这个大脚瓜⋯
If mother could see me like this…

863
01:09:55,167 --> 01:09:57,208
我猜，她会好开心
She'd be happy.

864
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:15,750
不成，还是出个锦囊！
"I've come up with a lesson!"

865
01:10:16,417 --> 01:10:20,708
妈妈的dot com散掉后，她又有计
Mother got inspired after her dot com failed.

866
01:10:21,208 --> 01:10:24,958
她出版了一本教烹饪的食谱
She published a cookbook.

867
01:10:25,250 --> 01:10:28,042
食谱最后一页教人整烧鸡
The last recipe was "Roast Chicken".

868
01:10:28,417 --> 01:10:30,875
方法简单，人人可学
A simple dish no less.

869
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:32,000
「烧鸡」
"Roast Chicken".

870
01:10:32,292 --> 01:10:34,375
材料是⋯鸡
Ingredient: chicken.

871
01:10:34,625 --> 01:10:38,625
方法：把鸡烧几烧
Method: roast the chicken.

872
01:10:38,833 --> 01:10:43,083
就这样，一味「烧鸡」大功告成
That way, you have a roast chicken.

873
01:10:44,417 --> 01:10:46,375
食谱里面补充说：
There was a remark in the cookbook:

874
01:10:47,083 --> 01:10:49,417
如果你想把鸡烧得美味可口⋯
If you want a delicious chicken…

875
01:10:50,125 --> 01:10:52,750
吃完后不会心肺实胃气涨
A chicken that wouldn't upset you…

876
01:10:53,250 --> 01:10:58,250
秘诀是：拜托，把鸡烧好一点⋯
The secret is: please, roast it well!

877
01:10:59,083 --> 01:11:01,208
多谢合作！
Thank you!

878
01:11:40,583 --> 01:11:42,542
麻烦你，一客常餐
One Regular, please.

879
01:11:42,667 --> 01:11:44,667
常餐？常餐有什么吃？
What's a Regular?

880
01:11:44,833 --> 01:11:46,042
跟特餐一样吧
The same as Special.

881
01:11:46,167 --> 01:11:47,292
特餐是什么？
What's a Special?

882
01:11:47,458 --> 01:11:48,792
跟快餐差不多
Same as Quickie.

883
01:11:48,917 --> 01:11:50,375
快餐又是什么？
What's a Quickie?

884
01:11:50,625 --> 01:11:52,625
快餐即是午餐
A Quickie is a Lunch.

885
01:11:52,833 --> 01:11:53,875
午餐吃什么？
What's for Lunch?

886
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:55,750
午餐跟晚餐一样
The same as Supper.

887
01:11:55,917 --> 01:11:57,333
晚餐又吃什么？
What's for Supper?

888
01:11:57,500 --> 01:11:59,667
晚餐即是常餐
Same as Regular.

889
01:11:59,833 --> 01:12:01,792
那么，两客常餐吧
We'll have the Regular.

890
01:12:01,875 --> 01:12:04,750
今天常餐精采呀！
Our Regular today is fantastic!

891
01:12:09,125 --> 01:12:11,417
对不起，常餐卖光了
Sorry, Regular is gone.

892
01:12:11,875 --> 01:12:13,083
那改要特餐吧
We can have the Special.

893
01:12:13,333 --> 01:12:15,208
特餐？特餐有什么吃？
What's a Special?

894
01:12:15,458 --> 01:12:17,042
特餐即是午餐呀
A Special is a Lunch.

895
01:12:17,542 --> 01:12:18,792
午餐又吃什么呢？
