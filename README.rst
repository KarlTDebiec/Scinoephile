Introduction
============

Script for adding romanization below Chinese-language subtitles. Presently only
supports the Yale romanization of Cantonese. This is really only useful for old
Hong Kong movies (1980s to early 1990s) with Chinese subtitles that match the
spoken Cantonese 1:1 (that is, using 係，喺，and 唔 rather than 是，在，and 不,
etc.). In the future may support Hanyu Pinyin for Mandarin films, and possibly
the side-by-side display of Chinese and English subtitles.

Dependencies
============

- hanziconv
- pandas
- pycantonese (Recent version from from GitHub rather than pypi)

Installation
============

Not currently possible or necessary. Just run the script from the folder within
which the script is located. Writes output directly to the terminal; just
redirect it to a file.
